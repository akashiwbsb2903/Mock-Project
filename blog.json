News flash: While that’s critical to your ultimate success, it’s just not enough for you to  lose the excess fat. To reach your get-lean goal, you must also follow a get-lean diet, filled with the best foods to burn fat . Why? Even if you work out hard for an hour every day, that still leaves 23 more hours for you to wreck all your hard work in the gym with just one slip-up: a measly handful of chips, a beer with the guys, or a burger at lunch. Diet is a huge, so to speak, part of the fat-loss equation. It’s the backbone of your entire plan, the foundation of a hard body .  Bodybuilding nutrition consultant Jim Juge says nutrition determines your success or failure, plain and simple. “The diet is 65% of what you need to get in shape,” he says. Juge would know, as he’s helped countless dedicated people reach their goals, from achieving their best body ever to placing first in bodybuilding competitions. You’ve got 28 days to get to your goal, so we’ve recruited Juge to help you every step of the way. He’s adapted a traditional bodybuilding competitor’s diet for a noncompetitor (that means you!) who wants to look his best, shedding as much fat as possible in a very short time. With just under a month, there’s no time to fool around, so get started on your high-protein meal plan now to lose weight and build muscle while you’re at it. Go to the grocery store and stock up tonight. Come breakfast time tomorrow, follow his plan as strictly as you can and get ready to show off those impressive muscles in a month.  1 of 10 10'000 Hours / Getty Strict. Strict. Strict. This is your mantra for the next 28 days. There’s just no way around the diet, says Juge, and eating clean is the name of this get-lean game. Juge’s diet plan is filled with fresh, clean foods that are as unprocessed as possible. Here are his three simple principles to shed fat fast. 2 of 10 Caiaimage/Paul Bradbury / Getty Habits and cravings are the devil when it comes to dieting. Let’s first deal with habits. Juge explains that it takes a good week or two to ease into dieting. “Fast food is so easy and there’s a McDonald’s on every corner. The hardest thing is to develop the new habit of preparing your meals and taking them with you.” The first week is the most difficult, so prepare yourself for some challenges as you abandon your usual routine. For example, you might usually go out for a sub sandwich or burger at lunch. You’ll now have to bring your food with you and resist the temptation of spicing up your meal with the Doritos in the vending machine or your usual can of Coke. It can be a real mental battle to stick to your food plan. To stay motivated and deal with cravings, Juge has a couple of great recommendations. First, schedule a cheat meal on every seventh day. “Many of my clients have their cheat meal on Sunday, so then they’re ready for Monday and the week to come,” he says. If you feel deprived during the week, concentrate on the cheat meal to come, knowing you can eat absolutely anything you want to—pizza, lasagna, doughnuts, beer, chips, you name it. Remember, though, it’s just one cheat meal, not an entire day of cheating. Afterward, get right back on the wagon with your next scheduled meal. Second, take a few photos of yourself to keep your motivation up. “Most of the people who come to me are doing it for a reason,” he explains. “They’re going on vacation, competing in a bodybuilding show, or maybe going to a reunion. I always have them strive for that goal. I take front, side, and back pictures of them at the beginning and have them post the photos on their mirror at home. I tell them, just keep looking at that picture and think of what you’re going to look like in a few weeks.” When it comes to cravings, protein drinks and bars may also help cure your need for sugar, says Juge. He recommends mixing a flavored protein powder in a blender with as much ice as possible, so it’ll taste more like a milkshake. Day Five’s protein shake includes a cup of berries, which will also help with sugar cravings. Once or twice per week, Juge adds, you can have a low-sugar, high-protein bar. The newest varieties taste more like candy bars, with state-of-the-art sweetening techniques. Your habits and cravings may both rear their heads at restaurants, where it’s easy to blow your diet in seconds. To stick to the plan, says Juge, be diligent in ordering. “Ask them to grill your meat without oil or grease. Ask for steamed vegetables with no butter. Get a salad (no cheese) with either fat-free dressing or a vinaigrette.” After his 14 years in bodybuilding, Juge testifies that he’s found many restaurants are accommodating, so there’s no reason to avoid them as long as they’ll cook to your preferences. 3 of 10 OJO Images / Getty Some men can lose up to 5 lbs. per week, says Juge, if they follow the diet strictly. He recommends striving for a weekly 2- to 3-lb. loss for more lasting effects. “That way it’s not such a drastic change and you’ll be less likely to put all the weight back on when the diet’s done,” he adds. Weigh yourself naked just once per week, at the same time, preferably on the same scale. That way it’ll be as accurate as possible. If you haven’t lost any weight after the first week, it may be time to troubleshoot. In addition to following an exercise program, Juge’s first line of defense is upping your cardio. Instead of one cardio session per day, he recommends doing 45 minutes of cardio in the morning on an empty stomach. Then add a second 30-minute session in the late afternoon or evening. If that doesn’t stimulate weight loss, Juge’s second line of defense is to cut carbs slightly. On lower days, drop to 60-80g a day rather than 100. Eat this low-carb diet for two days, then insert one higher-carb day (150g). Think of your nutritional plan as the anchor to stabilize all of your other efforts. Eating right will help you shed fat, increase your energy, and definitely look the way you want to. Follow this get-lean plan faithfully and you’ll be showing off your new, leaner body in less than a month. 4 of 10 FotografiaBasica / Getty Here are Juge’s picks for the top three foods to turn to when you’re trying to shed fat. Egg whites “There’s no fat or cholesterol and they’re pure protein. They’re very easy to prepare—they take just a couple of minutes to make.” Oatmeal It’s low in sugar, high in fiber, and provides sustained energy. Choose the old-fashioned variety if you have a few minutes to spare, and the one-minute oats if you’re in a rush. In a pinch, you can even rip open a packet of instant oatmeal (plain flavor only)—just add hot water and stir. Green veggies They’re healthy and deliver many benefits, like fiber for improved digestion. They contain many valuable vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants for better health. Plus, they’re bulky and fill you up for just a few grams of carbs per cup of veggies. ( Quick tip: To quickly steam veggies, put an inch or two of water in a bowl, add veggies, cover bowl, and microwave for 2-3 minutes.) 5 of 10 Neustockimages / Getty Your 28 days are up; you look great and want to keep it that way. Juge has an easy plan to maintain your body, yet enjoy greater flexibility with your diet. No.1, he says, is to eat a good, clean breakfast. If you’re at home, it’s much easier to do—just scramble a few egg whites and have a whole-grain item (whole-wheat bread or a bagel, for instance), and/or some fruit. Eat dinner at home, again a healthy, clean meal consisting of a lean protein source, green vegetable, and whole grains. Then, bring a protein shake or bar with you to work for a midday meal. “You’ve now got three clean meals taken care of,” says Juge. So if you’re eating at a restaurant at lunch and you want to have something different, you can have it. Just keep the rest of your meals pretty strict, without added sugars and fats. 6 of 10 Brian Macdonald / Getty Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 Meal 5 1,817 calories, 255 g protein, 98 g carbohydrate, 37 g fat, 20 g fiber 7 of 10 arsenik / Getty Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 Meal 5 1,959 calories, 254 g protein, 132 g carbohydrate, 39 g fat, 17 g fiber 8 of 10 LauriPatterson / Getty Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 Meal 5 1,862 calories, 226 g protein, 149 g carbohydrate, 35 g fat, 23 g fiber 9 of 10 Kostyantyn Manzhura / EyeEm / Getty Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 Meal 5 1,984 calories, 226 g protein, 200 g carbohydrate, 29 g fat, 28 g fiber 10 of 10 Anton Eine / EyeEm / Getty Meal 1 Meal 2 Meal 3 Meal 4 Meal 5 1,846 calories, 258 g protein, 122 g carbohydrate, 32 g fat, 23 g fiber Protein is everywhere in the grocery store, so it's time to learn what you're about to consume.

    "text": "The grilling season is upon us, and who doesn’t like a good BBQ? But will you be serving your guests and your family with healthy meats that will provide you with ample nutrients and protein without the heartache and stomach pains? Or will you be serving the meats that can potentially put your health and body at risk? With the summer holidays just around the corner it’s easy to get carried away with serving up a plate full of fatty meats that are high in calories. We’re talking steaks, ribs, pork chops, sausages, even good ol’ burgers. And let’s not forget the the hot dog — the mother of American processed meats . These are a nutritional wasteland. According to the AICR (American Institute for Cancer Research) , processed meats have been linked to causing cancer, largely of the colorectal variety.  Not to scare you away from the grill this season, but facts are facts. Over-charring, over-smoking, even keeping an unkempt grill can affect the nutritional content of your meat. A clean grill coupled with some efficient cooking is key in serving the best quality food to your family and friends. So what are healthy meats and which are still the best to serve while keeping your grill guests happy? There is a way to go clean and lean without sacrificing anything in the way of taste at the picnic table. Next time you’re at the grocery store, add these five healthy meat proteins (not counting chicken breasts, obviously) to your grocery shopping list for a memorable summer cook-out that will cut down on the gluttonous feeling. There are more options than the big three. 1 of 5 Breaking The Walls A BBQ without burgers is criminal, but the same can be said for red meat in your diet. Lean to extra lean ground turkey meat is a solid substitute for beef, but it’s important to remember that not all turkey burgers are created equal. Make sure to get ground turkey “breast” that is devoid of dark meat and skin, if you really want to cut the fat. And to avoid the dreaded dry turkey burger, mix in some olive oil to the patties (3 to 5 ounces in size), cook them quickly at roughly 165°, and finish them off with a slice of white American cheese. Nutritional info (per 5 oz): Protein – 41g Fat – 3.5g Carbs – 0g Calories – 196 2 of 5 AVN Photo Lab Everyone loves a good pork chop. Too bad your average cut is lined with a fortress of fat that seeps through the entire slab. A 4-oz pork chop contains 275 calories and 16g of fat. By comparison, a 4-oz serving of pork tenderloin (a lean strip located on the backbone) contains 120 calories and just 4g of fat. It’s a drastic difference, not to mention the tenderloin is loaded with protein (22g per serving) resulting in some serious fat burning. Before laying it out on the grill, give the tenderloin a nice dry rub consisting of some oregano, garlic powder, ground cumin, and dried thyme. Nutritional info (per 5 oz): Protein – 22g Fat – 4.6g Carbs – 0g Calories – 137 3 of 5 stockcreations For some people, standard BBQ fare of burgers and hot dogs just doesn’t cut the mustard. When it comes to grilling snobs, steak will always reign supreme. With respect to the red flag on red meat, if you want to incorporate some steak into your BBQ at least go with a lean cut. Flank steak is a great (and cheap) example—low in fat and calories compared to other steaks, while also being rich in protein (23g per serving) and iron. While not ideally tender, a lean meat like flank steak can be softened up with a marinade consisting of Worcestershire, soy, or chili sauce. Here’s a great idea: Grill the meat and slice it diagonally for some steak tacos, topped with some grilled onions and peppers, and fresh guacamole. Nutritional info (per 5 oz): Protein – 39g Fat – 10g Carbs – 0g Calories – 260 4 of 5 hlphoto Of course, if you want to go super-healthy (i.e., low in fat/calories) at your BBQ, fish is always the best way to go. But which fish is best fit for the grill? Our answer is swordfish; a beautiful steak that is meaty and firm and perfect for the rigors of backyard broiling. Swordfish is versatile, in that it can simply be prepared with some olive oil, lemon, salt and pepper, or can be marinated in a variety of different (healthy) sauce options. Best of all, swordfish’s dense texture makes for perfect grill marks. Just make sure not to cook it any longer than 5-7 minutes, to prevent the meat from drying out. Nutritional info (per 5 oz): Protein – 33g Fat – 11g Carbs – 0g Calories – 244 5 of 5 Shaiith For a more exotic form of fowl at your BBQ, ditch the grilled chicken for some wild or farm-raised pheasant. The lean game bird’s caloric content is made up of 78% protein, and the meat is also high in B vitamins and potassium. To maximize the healthiness, shed the skin and grill the tiny bird as you would a whole rotisserie chicken. While pheasant is low in the white meat department, it is still a lean option for your BBQ that packs a smoky taste very conducive to the grilling process. Nutritional info (per 5 oz): Protein – 45g Fat – 17g Carbs – 0g Calories – 335 When it comes to muscle-building nutrition, think quality over quantity.

    "text": "Bulking season has always had a reputation for being messy. Some lifters treat it as a free pass to load up on burgers, fries, and milkshakes in the name of “getting big.” Sure, the scale moves up fast, but so does your body fat, leaving you sluggish in the gym and staring at an extended, painful cut when it’s time to lean down. The reality is, bulking doesn’t have to be an all-you-can-eat buffet. A well-run bulking cycle is calculated, structured, and purposeful. I’m talking about adding slabs of quality muscle while keeping fat gain under control, so that when you transition out, you’re bigger, stronger, and still relatively lean.  Think of it like tuning a race car. You can’t just dump in cheap fuel and expect world-class performance. With the right balance of nutrition, training, and recovery, you can build size that lasts, strength that translates, and a physique you’ll be proud of at the end of the cycle. I’ve seen this firsthand both in the weight room and on the performance field. As a coach with a Master’s in Sports Performance, NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS), National Sports Performance Association Certified Sports Nutrition Coach, and USAW National Coach, I’ve helped athletes and lifters of all levels bulk the right way. Whether it’s preparing an Olympic weightlifter for competition or guiding everyday athletes in the gym, the same principles hold: smart bulking builds muscle without the baggage. In the sections ahead, we’ll lay out the blueprint for bulking smarter: dialing in your calories without overdoing it, training for muscle instead of just numbers, and building the daily habits that separate the jacked from the bloated. Make this list your go-to menu to gain muscle without fat. Calories drive growth, but the quality and quantity of those calories determine if you’re building lean muscle or just adding belly fat. As a certified nutrition coach, I’ve seen lifters make the same mistake over and over again, thinking bulking means eating without limits. That might move the scale, but most of that weight comes from fat. A better approach is starting with a moderate surplus of 250–500 calories above maintenance. This keeps your body in growth mode without forcing you to diet for months on end afterward. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Find Your Surplus Sweet Spot: Track weekly weight gain. A reasonable rate is 0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week. Faster than that, and your body is likely storing fat instead of building muscle. Coach’s Note: Eating like it’s Thanksgiving every night isn’t bulking—it’s bingeing. Smart bulking involves consuming clean foods in slightly larger quantities and adjusting your intake as your body responds. Training during a bulk is about creating the right stimulus for hypertrophy while maintaining optimal recovery. The goal is to convert extra calories into high-quality muscle with consistent, structured training. As a strength coach, I program bulking cycles differently from strength or peaking cycles. The priority is progressive overload in the hypertrophy range. This means pushing for steady increases in weight, reps, or sets each week to build muscle mass rather than test maximum strength. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Coach’s Note: During a bulk, volume and quality are the focus. Push for consistent progress in your training and avoid sloppy lifting that can stall your results. Training and nutrition are the foundation of a bulk, but lifestyle choices decide how well your body responds. Recovery, sleep, hydration, and stress management are often the difference between gaining lean muscle and spinning your wheels. Here’s what I emphasize with athletes: Coach’s Note: Lifestyle is the glue that holds training and nutrition together. Dial in these habits, and your bulking cycle will run smoother with far better results. Not all bulks are created equal. A smart bulk builds lean mass with minimal fat gain, while a dirty bulk leaves you sluggish and forces you into a long, painful cut. Here’s the difference I highlight with lifters: Coach’s Note: A lean 10 pounds gained from a smart bulk will outperform a sloppy 20 every time. Muscle built with intention lasts, while fat only adds more work later. Bulking should never be an excuse to get sloppy. With the right balance of nutrition, structured training, and supportive lifestyle habits, you can add lean muscle that looks good and performs even better. The key is precision—eating enough to grow, training with intent, and recovering so your body can utilize the extra calories effectively. A smart bulk builds strength, confidence, and muscle mass that you’ll retain even after the cycle ends. A dirty bulk only sets you up for extra fat loss later. The difference comes down to discipline and consistency in the details. The bodybuilder is readying for the pro stage with his own brand of \"science.\" If the majority of your answers are “yes,” you’re bulking smart. If not, it’s time to tighten up your approach before small mistakes become significant setbacks. Coach’s Note: When you step into a bulking cycle, think precision, not permission. Fuel your training, recover properly, and build size you’ll be proud of when it’s time to show the results.

    "text": "Never before have we had a bigger appetite for protein. Everyone seems to be waxing poetic about this macronutrient as it’s being hyped as the means to packing on more muscle and slashing hunger. Indeed, if you are focused on supporting muscle recovery and growth after hitting the gym, feeling less peckish following a meal, maintaining bones of steel, and keeping your immune system firing on all cylinders, then eating enough protein is crucial. So it’s a good thing that more people are becoming aware of their protein needs. This has left consumers on the hunt for easy ways to get more protein in their diet. And food and beverage manufacturers have taken notice. While protein bars and shakes are still out there in spades, more and more brands are adding protein to many unsuspecting foods. Protein-packed spaghetti and high-protein everything bagels. Chocolate chip cookies with as much protein as a trio of eggs. Watermelon flavored protein gels. Vanilla glazed donuts with 20 grams of protein. Fruity-tasting protein soda. Yes, we are in a golden era of protein-enhanced food. I won’t be surprised if I get a pitch sometime soon for a protein crusted frozen fish fillet or protein-enhanced carrot sticks. It’s never been easier to eat heaps of protein.  Despite all the hoopla, we need to proceed with caution when it comes to the crazy world of protein-rich, on-the-go foods. Not all foods and drinks boosted with protein are what you should be eating. Here’s what you need to know about the products beefed up with protein and how to figure out if you should go all-in. Spoiler alert: Foods that are naturally high in protein without a helping hand from food producers are still the best muscle-makers money can buy. Yes, these protein-enhanced foods make it easier to get the necessary amount of this muscle-making macro, but that doesn’t mean you have to pay up for them. As a general rule, active people who are keen on building lean body mass should aim to take in 1.6 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That is 130 to 163 grams of protein for a 180 pound guy. So, yes, that is a sizable amount of protein you need to stuff in every day to hone your physique. But certainly not impossible if you make sure to eat sufficient amounts of protein-dense foods like chicken, eggs, fish, tofu, and Greek yogurt at your meals and snacks. And perhaps a scoop or two of protein powder into your shakes. If you do this, then the need for expensive protein-boosted foods is less pressing. After all, before all these products hit the market somehow we got by without suffering the perils of protein deficiency. Arnold did not have access to bread with 8g of protein in a slice. The upshot is that you should try to accurately calculate your daily protein intake and then use this information to better understand your need, or not, for foods that are jacked up with extra protein. Perhaps protein chips and steak aren’t created equal. A recent analysis of a lofty 1,641 protein bars published in the journal Scientific Reports found that the quality of protein in most bars on the market is far from ideal for building muscle. For the study, researchers analyzed the protein content, source, and nutritional quality of numerous widely available protein bars. Although 81% of the protein bars analyzed were considered high in protein from sources like whey and soy, when the protein sources were processed into bar form, digestibility typically dropped significantly. The study authors surmise that the low numbers can be attributed to the use of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibers that may deteriorate the bioaccessibility of essential amino acids. So 20 grams of protein from a bar may not be equivalent to the same amount of the macro from a hunk of chicken. Another reason to focus on eating mostly whole food sources of protein. Certainly, research like this should make us question the protein quality of certain processed foods like bars. For good reason, we have associated protein with health, but this is certainly not always the case. Just because a product as amped up their protein does not make it a nutritional hero. Never forget that protein can be just one aspect of a food. If a protein-fortified food or beverage is also laced with added artificial sweeteners, sugars, refined grains, abundant fat calories, emulsifiers, salt, and an assortment of tongue-twisting additives then you have to start questioning whether that extra protein is worth the overall nutrition cost. For instance, I’ve come across some high-protein cereals that have more grams of added sugars than grams of protein. Protein pretzels with plenty of refined grains and sodium can still be considered ultra-processed, despite giving you way more protein than your standard ballpark option. Do your due diligence and read package labels carefully to make sure all that protein doesn’t come with too much nutritional baggage. Not all foods advertised as being a protein heavyweight are true to their marketing. It’s easy to find so-called protein bars, protein granola, and protein candy that don’t deliver much more than the normal option. Protein has become a marketing term and some brands are leaning heavily on this without delivering the goods. Don’t believe the front-of-the-package hype until you determine for yourself how much protein the product has. There is no regulated amount of protein that a product has to contain before saying it is ‘high-protein’, but sage advice is that a protein-fortified food or drink should give you at least 8 to 10 grams in a serving. These protein-enhanced foods don’t sacrifice nutrition to go bigger on the muscle-sculpting macro. Nutrition (1 pouch): 340 calories, 10g fat, 49g carbs, 11g fiber, 20g protein, 240mg sodium This no-cooking-required overnight muesli-oatmeal hybrid is a nutritional giant. Each pouch of oats, which you only need to dump into a jar or bowl and soak in milk for a few hours, has an impressive 20 grams of plant-based protein and 11g of dietary fiber from sources like chia seeds. There is even some probiotics in the fold to give your gut a boost. Plus, the product is low in added sugar, letting the dried fruit carry most of the sweetness. And the chocolate flavor makes it a crave-worthy breakfast. The great balance of carbs and protein makes this a good option for post-gym recovery nutrition. Oikos Pro Plain Nutrition (3/4 cup): 160 calories, 3.5g fat, 6g carbs, 0g fiber, 25g protein, 60mg sodium The inclusion of whey protein gives this yogurt even more of the macro than most Greek versions on the market. Plus, it’s deliciously thick without including any thickening agents and delivers just the right amount of tang. The plain flavor means there are no added sugars. Unbun Protein Seeded Bread Nutrition (2 slices): 160 calories, 4.5g fat, 22g carbs, 19g fiber, 22g protein, 430mg sodium This isn’t your standard slice of doughy white sandwich bread. The bread is made with milk protein isolate and whey protein concentrate to help turn your lunch sandwiches and morning toast into a protein powerhouse. There are no refined grains or added sugar, a rarity in the commercial bread industry. And the fiber levels are off-the-charts. Just something to keep in mind if your gut isn’t used to eating high-fiber foods. If this is the case, you may want to ease into the product by starting with a single slice at a time. Felicia Red Lentil Penne Nutrition (3.5 oz): 340 calories, 1.5g fat, 65g carbs, 12g fiber, 26g protein, 0mg sodium This shaped pasta is made with organic red lentil flour instead of wheat flour giving, it a serious protein and fiber advantage. And this dynamic duo makes the noodles extra satiating. When prepared as instructed, the texture doesn’t suffer. Consider this your path to next-level pasta salad.

    "text": "There is a reason why so many muscle-minded men turn to their blender to help them get more pumped. Blended shakes are an easy way to knock back the protein you need every day to pack on muscle like a pro. Not to mention a compact way to obtain key nutrients that may be otherwise lacking in your daily diet. And now that flip-flop season is in full swing you might be giving your blender a stiff daily workout to help you beat the heat. But, as you’ve likely experienced, smoothies can come off as one-note and be as exciting to drink as cough syrup. Too many of us are on auto-pilot with our protein shakes blending or shaking together the same tired ingredients. Which is a shame, because at their core, smoothies are an excellent way to work all sorts of foods with a standout nutritional pedigree into your diet.  Whether you’re whipping up a quick breakfast replacement, a muscle-building drink after a monster workout or a frosty snack, you need to know that smoothies are infinitely riffable and are ready to welcome all sorts of seemingly strange bedfellows that can be turned into a delicious drink to send down the hatch. With a little know-how and a few underutilized ingredients, it’s possible to make a protein shake so delicious you’ll actually crave it. So, yes, please stop thinking about protein shakes as little more than protein powder and water. To help you chug back better shakes, here are a batch of smoothies that whip in some outside-the-box ingredients (hello, avocado) that make it way better to drink your protein. Every one manages to hit you with a perfect trifecta of taste, texture, and nutrition. Gentlemen start your blenders: These nutritious smoothies are the real big gulps. Yes, you can make better smoothies at home. Follow these steps to master the shake making formula. Follow the Leader: For the most efficient blending, pour liquids first into your container followed by soft items like yogurt and nut butters, then powder, and finally anything hard including raw vegetables. Frozen ingredients such as fruit and ice go in last to help pull all the other ingredients down into the swirling blades for even mixing. If your blender has a speed adjustment knob, begin at the lowest blender speed then work your way up to high speed to let it rip. Be Liquid Smart: If you are not sure of the exact proportions, dumping in all of your milk, juice, or water right away could leave you with a smoothie that seems watered down. You can try blending in a bit less liquid at the start and see if you like the consistency. Too thick? Blend in more liquid until you get the consistency you want. Too thin? Whip in additional frozen fruit. Patience Pays: Let’s not gloss over this: Take. Your. Time. Smoothies are quick, but that doesn’t mean a lack of patience and blending everything up for a couple of seconds is going to cut it. You want to blend together all the ingredients for a bit of time so that your smoothie is lump-free. Aim for at least 1 minute with a regular blender, or about 30 seconds if you’re using a machine with serious horsepower, like a Vitamix. Scale Back the Sweet Stuff: Fruit, honey, dates, juices and sugar-sweetened dairy-free milk can result in a blender drink that is not too far off of liquid candy. In general, aim to blend in no more than two sugary items. Truth is, fruit should provide nearly all the sweetness that is needed. If you’re blending in yogurt or non-dairy milk such as almond or soy make sure to use unsweetened kinds. Beyond the Powder: Yes, protein powder is a convenient way to give your creamy drinks a hefty dose of this macro, but it’s not the only way. Items like Greek yogurt, ricotta cheese, pasteurized egg whites, cottage cheese, and even soft tofu can help you go bigger on protein and help improve the texture and taste of your blender creations. Going Bananas: Blending in frozen bananas is the perfect way to instantly give your smoothie a frosty and creamy personality. Ice cubes? Not so much. To freeze ripe bananas for your muscle-making shakes, simply peel the fruit, chop into quarters, spread out on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Then store them in the freezer in an air-tight zip-top bag. Don’t Forget the Fat: Fats help your body absorb various fat-soluble nutrients in the shake. They can also provide a rich, creamy consistency. Nut butters, seeds, nuts, full-fat dairy and even avocado are ways to deliciously fatten up your post-gym drinks. If you’re adding a fat source and the shake turns weirdly gloppy when blended, add a little extra liquid to smooth it out. Go for Bonus Flavor: There are easy ways to make your drink pop with exciting flavor. A touch of spice like cinnamon or nutmeg can instantly transform a smoothie from meh to memorable. Herbs like mint or basil, citrus zest such as lemon, fresh ginger, and vanilla extract are also great ways to add calorie-free flavor to your shakes. Hold the bread, this smoothie tastes like everyone’s favorite schoolyard sandwich. Wheat germ is the stealth health food here as it contains a wide range of essential vitamins and minerals including selenium, magnesium, phosphorus and thiamine. This is a fresh tasting smoothie fit for the season. Cottage cheese lends the drink the required amount of protein and frozen blueberries have a surfeit of disease-thwarting anthocyanin antioxidants. Place all of the ingredients in a blender in the order listed and blend until smooth. This smoothie tastes like dessert, albeit a mega-nutritious one. Sweet potato adds wonderful natural sweetness to this decadent tasting shake not to mention a wallop of immune-boosting vitamin A. Consider cooking up a few at a time so they are ready to go for shake time. In similar vein to yogurt, tangy kefir is a surefire way to increase your intake of muscle-building protein and the gut-benefiting beneficial critters known as probiotics. Place all of the ingredients in a blender container in the order listed and blend until smooth. Found alongside baby spinach and arugula in the supermarket, tender baby kale is less bitter tasting than its grown-up version and requires no chopping making it a great way to infuse smoothies with nutritional might. Virtually flavorless soft tofu is a surprising way to add plant-based protein to smoothies as are nutty tasting hemp seeds. Mango adds a plenty of sweetness and some tropical flair. And just a hint of sourness in smoothies from items like lemon juice can sharpen fruitiness. Place all of the ingredients in a blender container in the order listed and blend until smooth. This blender drink is definitely a smooth way to start your day. Boxed pasteurized egg whites are perfectly safe to eat straight from the carton offering breakfast smoothies a pure source of top-notch protein. Using brewed coffee as your liquid base perks up your morning drink, while milk powder is an inexpensive way (yes, less pricey than protein powder) to add creamy consistency to smoothies and some extra protein. Blend in subzero cherries and you’ll get a hit of health-hiking antioxidants. Place all of the ingredients in a blender container in the order listed and blend until smooth. When it comes to smoothies, it’s time to root for naturally sweet beets. They are a fantastic source of naturally occurring nitrates that can aid in cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure numbers. High powered blenders can handle raw beets, but if you’re using one with wimpy horsepower or want a sweeter-tasting shake you may want to blend in cooked ones. Some supermarket produce sections now carry pre-cooked beets. Good for more than just lasagna, ricotta cheese adds creamy richness and a dose of muscle-friendly whey protein. Raspberries lend the drink much-needed fiber and antioxidants. The mint and orange zest are all about the flavor magic. Place all of the ingredients in a blender container in the order listed and blend on high power for 1 minute, or until smooth. Avocado gives smoothies an unbeatable creamy texture without making them taste like guacamole. Plus, you’ll benefit from its nutritional payload which includes heart-healthy monounsaturated fat, fat-fighting fiber and a range of vitamins including vitamin C and K. Blending in spinach is an easy way to add a nutrition boost without evening knowing it’s there. Adding a touch of fiery cayenne makes the drink taste extra exciting. Place all of the ingredients in a blander container and blend until smooth. If too thick, blend in additional liquid. A perfect protein-packed drink to help you keep your cool this summer. Greek yogurt gives you extra protein and probiotics, creamy tahini delivers good-for-you fats, and peaches and carrot are a source of immune-boosting beta-carotene. A smoothie that even Bugs Bunny would hop into the kitchen for. Place all of the ingredients in a blender in the order listed and blend until smooth. Hitting the road this summer? You need not rely on sugar-loaded drinks from the juice bar. The ingenious Nutribullet Flip is a rechargeable portable blender that lets you drink your protein whether you are on the beach or trapped in a dingy hotel room. The insulated cup will keep your smoothie nice and frosty for several hours. And the machine is powerful enough it won’t leave chunks of frozen fruit floating in your drink. Need a cold smoothie to go? After blending, pour your drink into an insulated 32 oz wide mouth Hydro Flask bottle that is up to the task of keeping your drinks frosty or steamy for several hours. Bonus points for its splashy colors. When it comes to muscle-building nutrition, think quality over quantity. Protein is everywhere in the grocery store, so it's time to learn what you're about to consume. With grilling season upon us, check out this list of healthy, protein-packed BBQ meats.",

Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of body fat. It’s calculated using a statistical ratio of weight to height and applied based on your sex assigned at birth ( 1 , 2 ). Developed over a century ago by Adolphe Quetelet, BMI has been an important measurement to characterize obesity at the public health level ( 3 ). More recently, however, it’s been challenged for its discrepancies. BMI may misclassify rates of overweight and obesity in historically marginalized ethnic populations, particularly Black women. This article discusses the history of the BMI, whether it discriminates against Black women, and other metrics that Black women can use to gain insights into their health. In 1842, Belgian astronomer and mathematician Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet developed the BMI to identify statistical laws in the “average man” and observe how these appeared in the general population ( 3 ). A 1968 publication of Quetelet’s work revealed that he evaluated the growth, height, and weight of more than 9,000 white men, women, and children in Brussels and Belgium. He used the results to name “laws” of growth ( 4 ). These “laws” characterized changes in physical attributes — namely height, weight, and strength — that can be expected as humans age and develop from infancy to adulthood. This information was used to advance medicine at that time. It allowed medical practitioners to identify an individual based on their physical qualities and appropriately estimate their age. It was not until 1972, however, that nutritional epidemiologist and physician Ancel Keys determined that the BMI was a suitable indicator of body fat percentage in a population ( 3 ). Since then, the BMI has been relied on as a standardized measure of obesity in various populations and is a key metric in the healthcare field. The BMI was established in 1842 by Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet to support medical advancements. It was institutionalized in 1972, when nutritional epidemiologist Ancel Keys decided it was a suitable indicator of body fat percentage. Given that the BMI was developed based on studies in white populations, its ability to accurately classify overweight and obesity in other populations has been questioned ( 5 ). Furthermore, BMI has been adapted to compare “healthy” and “unhealthy” weights. High BMI bodies have been stigmatized as “diseased bodies” in both scientific literature and media messaging ( 3 ). Furthermore, those with high BMI bodies have been characterized as lacking willpower. For people and populations that BMI misclassifies as overweight, there can be social and medical consequences. BMI is an index relating weight to height. Despite being an estimate of body fat, it does not take body composition into account — that is, the percent of weight that’s fat versus lean mass, like muscle ( 5 ). For instance, athletes or people with higher muscle mass percentages are often wrongly classified as overweight because of BMI readings, although their body fat percent may be within normal ranges ( 1 ). Generally, non-Hispanic Black men and women have lower body fat percentages and higher muscle mass compared with non-Hispanic white people and Mexican Americans ( 5 , 6 ). This means that the BMI index may overestimate overweight and obesity in non-Hispanic Black men and women, and it potentially misclassifies them as “unhealthy.” Remember: Although BMI is an effective indicator to monitor changes at the population level, it’s insufficient as a sole measure to diagnose obesity in individuals ( 1 , 3 , 5 ). The BMI is applied in the same way for white, Hispanic, and Black people. However, it’s been adjusted for Asian populations, because it underestimates obesity in this group ( 1 ). People of Asian descent have a “normal-weight obesity” body type. This means that their BMI typically falls within the normal range, but they have a higher body fat percent at any given BMI ( 7 , 8 ). Therefore, the BMI scale has been lowered to account for their body type and to correctly identify those at an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes , which is prevalent among Asian populations ( 7 , 8 ). An older study showed that ethnic differences in body structure of Greenland Inuit populations compared with European and American white populations means that the BMI likely also overestimates overweight and obesity among the Inuit ( 9 ). Ethnic differences in body composition among women of African descent may be an underlying contributor to higher BMI rates among Black women. But those differences need to be studied to determine their clinical significance ( 5 , 10 ). A study in counties across the United States demonstrated that structural racism — discriminatory policies that lead to health disparities and poor health outcomes in some individuals — influences higher BMI in Black people ( 10 ). BMI is strongly correlated with race. For example, white men have the lowest trajectories for weight gain, and Black women have the highest odds of developing obesity and higher BMIs — 6% higher than everyone else ( 10 ). Furthermore, the BMI may be considered inherently racist. Its metrics are based on a narrow study population of white people and don’t account for differences in body composition between ethnic groups, but it’s been used to classify obesity and “health” in these groups anyway. Racism continues to be of scientific interest for the role it plays in health disparities, BMI among racial and ethnic groups, and disease rates ( 10 ). BMI cannot distinguish body composition and often wrongly classifies people with higher muscle mass as overweight. It’s unclear if ethnic differences in body composition have clinical significance, but structural racism contributes to higher BMIs. Accurate measures of excess body fat or obesity are important for screening tests, such as for type 2 diabetes. Here are three health metrics aside from BMI that may be more accurate for Black women. While the BMI is a good predictor of your risk of developing type 2 diabetes, it’s more accurate when combined with waist circumference measures ( 11 ). Waist circumference measures abdominal adiposity — the excess fat around organs — and is an independent predictor of heart disease and type 2 diabetes risks ( 12 ). Traditional recommendations indicate that waist circumference should be less than 35 inches (88 cm) in women and less than 40 inches (102 cm) in men ( 13 ). However, BMI-specific waist circumference recommendations are being developed across ethnic groups to provide more accurate health risk assessments ( 13 ). Another measure of abdominal obesity is the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), which is a strong predictor of metabolic risk and heart disease ( 14 ). Combining this measure with the BMI produces strong insights into patterns of body fat storage and health risk ( 15 ). According to an older report from the World Health Organization, an ideal WHR is less than 0.85 for women, and 0.9 for men ( 16 ). Body impedance analysis (BIA) provides detailed information on body composition and can serve as a complementary measurement to the BMI. In some instances, BIA may be interchangeable with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry — the gold standard for body composition measurements — in population studies ( 17 ). Measures of waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and body impedance analysis support more accurate interpretations of BMI values for health risk screenings. BMI relates weight to height and is an estimate of body fat and disease risk, although it’s not an accurate measure of body composition. People of African descent have been shown to have lower body fat percentage and higher muscle masses. Therefore, BMI may misclassify them as overweight or obese, since BMI doesn’t take variation in body composition into account. Plus, studies indicate that structural racism specifically leads to higher BMIs among Black women, potentially making the BMI an unfair metric for this population. More research is needed to clarify whether ethnic differences in body structure are clinically significant for disease outcomes. The BMI should not be used as a stand-alone measure. When it’s applied that way, it’s likely an unfair metric for Black women. Other measures, such as waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and body impedance analysis, should be used to assess health risks.

    "text": "Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Some foods and drinks may increase the risk of arthritis or make symptoms worse, for instance, highly processed foods and sweetened drinks. If you have arthritis , making the right dietary choices can not only help manage your symptoms but also reduce the risk of complications, help boost your overall well-being, and improve your quality of life. There are over 100 types of arthritis, but osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common. Other types include rheumatoid arthritis (RA) , psoriatic arthritis (PsA) , and gout . They all involve some degree of inflammation. What you choose to eat and drink with arthritis may affect your symptoms and overall well-being. Here, learn about some foods and beverages to avoid if you have arthritis. Everyone can benefit from limiting their sugar intake, and especially if they have arthritis. Added sugars are found in candy, soda, ice cream, and numerous other foods, including barbecue sauce, salad dressings, and ketchup. In a study involving 217 people with RA, participants noted that among 20 foods, sugar-sweetened soda and desserts seemed most likely to worsen their symptoms. What to know about added sugars Some research links red meat and processed meat to inflammation , which may increase arthritis symptoms. For example, people who eat a lot of processed and red meats may have higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and homocysteine. These are markers of inflammation. The study in 217 people with RA mentioned above also found that red meat commonly worsened RA symptoms. A 2019 review concluded that plant-based diets that exclude red meat may improve arthritis symptoms. Meanwhile, research published in 2022 found a link between a higher risk of RA and consumption of processed meats, compared with fish and seafood. However, the authors found no link between RA and red meat or poultry. More research is needed. Is it healthy to eat meat? Gluten is a group of proteins in wheat, barley, rye, and other cereals. Some research has linked it to increased inflammation and suggests that going gluten-free may ease arthritis symptoms. People with celiac disease also have a higher risk of RA than those without celiac disease. Some limited research has suggested that a gluten-free, vegan diet might reduce disease activity and improve inflammation. However, more research is needed to confirm whether a gluten-free diet will benefit people with arthritis. Can gluten affect arthritis? Ultra-processed items — such as fast food, breakfast cereal , and baked goods — tend to be high in refined grains, added sugar, preservatives, fructose, and other potentially inflammatory ingredients, all of which may worsen arthritis symptoms. Research suggests that highly processed foods may increase your risk of RA by contributing to inflammation and obesity , which is also a risk factor for RA. What’s more, in a study in 56 people with RA, those who ate higher amounts of ultra-processed food showed increased heart disease risk factors, including higher levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), a long-term marker of blood sugar control. As such, processed foods may worsen your overall health and increase your risk of other diseases. How to swap highly processed foods for healthier options Diets high in omega-6 fats and low in omega-3 fats may worsen symptoms of knee pain, which is common with OA and RA. These fats are necessary for health, but an imbalance may increase the risk of inflammation. Omega-3 is present in oily fish, oily seeds, and green vegetables, while omega-6 occurs in margarines, vegetable shortening, and cooking oils such as corn and safflower. Ensuring a balance between these types of oils may improve arthritis symptoms. Tip: Use olive oil as an example of an oil that is low in omega-6 FA, while increasing fatty fish intake to help optimize omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. Are vegetable and seed oils bad for you? Cutting back on salt may be good for people with arthritis. Foods high in salt include shrimp, canned soup, pizza, certain cheeses, processed meats, and numerous other processed items. A 2019 mouse study found that arthritis was more severe in mice that consumed a high salt diet than in those whose diet had less salt. Research has also suggested that a high sodium intake may be a risk factor for autoimmune diseases like inflammatory arthritis in people. One factor could be that salt stimulates immunological processes that lead to inflammation. Meanwhile, a 2018 study linked a high sodium intake to an increased risk of RA. How much salt do you need? Dietary advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are molecules created through reactions between sugars and proteins or fats. They exist naturally in uncooked animal foods and are formed through certain cooking methods. Foods that are high in AGEs include: When AGEs accumulate in high amounts in your body, oxidative stress and inflammation may occur . Oxidative stress and AGE formation are linked to disease progression in people with arthritis. People with inflammatory arthritis — such as RA — may have higher levels of AGEs in their bodies than those without. AGE accumulation in bones and joints may play a role in the development and progression of OA. Replacing high AGE foods with nutritious, whole foods like vegetables, fruits, legumes, and fish may reduce the total AGE load in your body. What are AGE foods and how can you swap them out in your diet? It’s true that red wine contains resveratrol, an antioxidant that may have health benefits. However, any alcohol use has its downsides. More research is needed to confirm the role that alcohol plays in arthritis, but scientists don’t recommend drinking alcohol as a way to prevent arthritis or manage its symptoms. For instance: In brief, it’s best to limit your alcohol consumption as it may worsen arthritis symptoms. What’s the link between alcohol and RA? Sugary beverages, like sodas, may significantly increase your risk of arthritis. Drinks containing fructose may also lead to an increase in uric acid levels, which can worsen gout. Sodas and other sweetened drinks contain sugar, aspartame, and phosphoric acid, which can also affect the body’s ability to absorb calcium, which is necessary for bone health. Is fructose in fruit bad for you? According to the Arthritis Foundation (AF) , it’s not clear whether coffee is good for people with arthritis or not. On the one hand, it contains antioxidants that may help reduce inflammation. On the other hand, people should be mindful of the caffeine content. If you like a cup of coffee, it’s best to: How does caffeine affect your body? Some people find that milk and other dairy products trigger an inflammatory reaction, but this is not true for everyone. If you can tolerate milk, it is a good source of vitamin D and calcium . Choose low or zero-fat dairy products to lower the risk of weight gain and unhealthy fats. What are the pros and cons of cow’s milk? The 5 top foods or food ingredients to avoid with arthritis are: You should also consider limiting or avoiding sugar-sweetened beverages, red wine, and other alcohol. It’s worth noting that excessive salt intake has also been associated with a higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, especially in those who smoke. A balanced diet that provides a range of antioxidants and other nutrients is most likely beneficial for anyone with arthritis. This means a focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and healthy oils, such as olive oil. Consider trying a Mediterranean Diet . The 10 best foods to eat if you have arthritis Bananas are good for arthritis as they contain antioxidants, which can help decrease inflammation, and potassium , which can help strengthen bones. 11 evidence-based health benefits of bananas Some people say that eggplants, tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers seem to worsen arthritis pain and inflammation. These are all part of the nightshade family and contain solanine. However, there is no scientific evidence to confirm this, and these foods offer a range of essential nutrients. Some experts believe that citrus fruits, such as lemons, may not be helpful, but other evidence suggests the flavonoids in citrus fruits may be beneficial due to their anti-inflammatory properties. More research is needed. If you have arthritis, a healthy diet and lifestyle may help improve your symptoms. Research suggests avoiding certain foods and beverages, including highly processed foods, red meat, fried foods , alcohol, and anything with added sugars. Keep in mind that lifestyle factors like your activity level , body weight, and smoking status are also vital to managing arthritis.

Supplements are having a moment. A 2022 survey of more than 3,100 U.S. adults indicated that 75 percent take some form of nutritional supplement. Of those consumers, 52 percent said they took a specialty supplement, like omega-3s, probiotics, or fiber. Johna Burdeos , RD, a registered dietitian, says a myriad of factors have contributed to the popularity of supplements, vitamins, and minerals, including the pandemic and ease of purchasing via online retailers. Still, supplements aren’t without their detractors. The industry isn’t regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). Plus, you may wonder whether you need dietary supplements if you’re eating a well-balanced diet. Here’s what the research and experts have to say about when it’s beneficial to add vitamins, minerals, and supplements to your diet, plus which ones to choose. The subject is up for debate, even among experts. “Supplements are not usually the only possible solution for most adults to achieve and maintain good health,” says Maddie Pasquariello , MS, RDN. “In fact, for many of those experiencing health problems, supplements are not usually the first line of defense that dieticians will turn to.” Other lifestyle tweaks, like changes to diet and exercise recommendations, typically come first. That said, supplements are recommended as a standard in some cases. In other cases, they may help fill in the gaps for nutrient deficiencies in the diet, says Stephanie Greunke, RD, a registered dietician and member of Needed ‘s practitioner collective. Common cases where providers will recommend taking vitamins, supplements, or minerals include: Supplements may have their detractors, but some can be beneficial, particularly in specific circumstances. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends people with uteruses should begin taking prenatal vitamins when they start trying to become pregnant and continue intake throughout pregnancy. Burdeos recommends starting three months in advance of your first attempt to become pregnant. The CDC recommends taking prenatal vitamins with 400 mg of folic acid to protect against certain birth defects. The ACOG recommends getting at least 27 milligrams of iron per day during pregnancy, something often found in prenatal vitamins. Burdeos says folic acid combined with iron provides benefits for a fetus. “Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects, which are serious abnormalities in the baby’s brain and spinal cord,” Burdeos says. “Iron helps facilitate the transportation of oxygen throughout the body. Iron helps support the proper development of the baby and the placenta.” About 42 percent of people are vitamin D deficient, and Black people have the highest rates— 82 percent, according to a 2022 study . The sun is a natural source of vitamin D, and egg yolks and fatty fish are quality food sources. Other than that, it’s slim pickings, according to the National Insitute of Health (NIH) . “It’s nearly impossible to get all the vitamin D you need from food alone,” Greunke says. “Oily fish, mushrooms, and fortified dairy provide vitamin D, but not in sufficient quantities to meet daily needs.” Vitamin D deficiency is linked to multiple conditions, including: Research suggests that taking vitamin D during pregnancy could reduce the risk of: The NIH recommends that infants up to 12 months old take 10 mcg of vitamin D per day. Infant formula is fortified with vitamin D, so the CDC says that children younger than 12 months who are exclusively formula-fed likely don’t need a vitamin D supplement. A 2015 study indicated that a lactating parent could take 6,400 IU of vitamin D per day to supply an adequate amount to the nursing infant through human milk. The NIH advises that people ages 1 to 70 need 600 IU per day, and people over 70 should consume 800 IU per day. Since it’s challenging to get that from food, Greunke says a vitamin D supplement is worth it even past infancy. One of the most popular vitamins just might be Omega 3’s. They’re fatty acids naturally found in fish like salmon and nuts, such as walnuts. Burdeos says that you may benefit from taking one if your diet is low on these items. Though omega 3’s are linked with good heart health, the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) says the data for that association is based on seafood intake. However, the agency says it may help reduce triglycerides and soothe rheumatoid arthritis symptoms. B12 naturally occurs in animal products, and Burdeos says it’s important for: An older study from 2022 indicates that B12 deficiency is higher in vegans than in vegetarians. Nearly two-thirds of pregnant people were also deficient. She says B12 supplementation is worth it for individuals who are deficient, particularly those who do not consume animal protein. Iron is present in food like nuts and dark, leafy greens. According to the NIH, it helps : Though Pasquariello typically recommends a food-first approach, people with iron deficiencies and those who are borderline anemic may benefit from iron supplementation. Additionally, pregnant people should seek out a prenatal with iron to support fetal development. Always ask your doctor for the best option, as it’s possible to take too much iron, which in rare cases can lead to iron poisoning . Magnesium is a naturally occurring mineral and the fourth-most abundant one in the body. Still, nearly half of the U.S. population doesn’t ingest enough magnesium, according to a 2018 study. Greunke says that magnesium supplements can help. Research indicates oral magnesium supplementation may help: Some supplements, like probiotics, are all the rage. But experts and researchers say the data isn’t there to support the hype. You can hold off on trying these supplements. These powders look healthy and have promising buzzwords on labels. “Most greens powders products claim to be filled with whole food sources of nutrients and pre- and probiotics,” Pasquariello says. “This is highly deceptive, as it tricks consumers into thinking they can then substitute greens powders for actual greens or green vegetables.” Pasquariello says claims that greens powders boost energy, performance, and digestion are unfounded. There’s not much research on them other than a small, 40-person study from 2009 that indicated that supplementing with a fruit and vegetable powder for 90 days might reduce blood pressure but not body weight. Pasquariello suggests adding actual greens, specifically the leafy variety, to your diet instead. Probiotics are one of the most popular supplements, but the NCCIH indicates the evidence to support probiotic supplements for issues like diarrhea and ulcerative colitis is not supported by data at this time. Some products will market themselves as having “mega-doses.” The jargon sounds great, but Burdeos says it’s not. “Unless it is specified by your doctor, these kinds of supplements are a case of too much of a good thing,” she says. She says the mega-doses can have long-term impacts. “For example, too much vitamin D can lead to kidney problems, and too much vitamin C can cause digestive issues,” Burdeos says. This applies to taking any supplement at all. If you’re getting the nutrients from diet alone, there’s no need to add any more of it to your diet through an oral tablet or powder. Greunke and research from 2017 indicate that creatine monohydrate can reduce injury and speed recovery. “Buffered” and “advanced” versions claim to be a step up. “These formulas are more expensive and state that they’re better absorbed, but that hasn’t proven to be true,” Greunke says. Since supplements are not held to the same standard as food, it can feel like the wild west out there. Experts share insights for navigating the vitamin and mineral aisle of the grocery store below. You may notice these terms on mineral bottles. “Chelated means the mineral was altered in a way that improves absorption,” Greunke says. “This is done by combining the mineral with another molecule, like an amino acid or organic acid, to make it easier for the body to absorb.” Examples include: “Non-chelated minerals, on the other hand, are unstable, and, as they aren’t bound to something else, they are attracting other molecules to bind to them, thus interfering more with absorption,” Burdeos says. Research is mixed and often includes small sample sizes. For example, a 2014 study of 15 people indicated that chelated zinc as zinc citrate and zinc gluconate was absorbed better than non-chelated zinc and might be beneficial for zinc deficiency and treating diarrhea. A 2019 study suggested chelated magnesium glycerophosphate did a significantly better job of increasing blood magnesium levels than non-chelated magnesium oxide. However, a 2014 study of postmenopausal people indicated that non-chelated calcium carbonate was absorbed more quickly and upped blood calcium levels better than calcium citrate. Greunke says food and water make up the majority of our mineral intake. They can also be found in: “Thoughtful supplements take into consideration nutrient competition,” Greunke says. “For example, iron competes with other minerals for absorption, such as zinc, calcium, copper, and magnesium.” Greunke suggests avoiding multivitamins with iron. Calcium and iron supplements can be taken a couple of hours apart. It’s also possible to take too much iron, so always talk to your doctor before adding it to your supplement regimen. Some minerals act like electrolytes, including: Greunke says electrolytes: The experts Healthline spoke with also recommended: How do you know if your supplement is actually working or whether should scale back? Experts share a few telltale signs. Much of what goes in comes out eventually. “High doses of magnesium citrate and vitamin C can cause diarrhea, so if this is happening, you’ll want to reduce the amount you’re taking,” Greunke says. “Sometimes, high doses of B-vitamins can lead to bright yellow colored urine; however, this isn’t necessarily harmful.” Is the pep in your step the result of a supplement or a placebo effect? “Some supplements like vitamin B12 can yield quick improvements in energy,” Greunke says. “Adrenal supplements can help individuals feel calmer and focused relatively quickly. If an individual is dehydrated or imbalanced in minerals, an electrolyte supplement can boost energy, physical performance, and improve blood pressure.” Others may have more subtle or long-term effects. Whether OTC or in-office testing is necessary depends on the reason you’re taking the supplements. If it’s to lower blood sugar because of pre-diabetes or diabetes, at-home glucose monitoring and in-office bloodwork are important, Greunke says. Pasquariello says medical professionals can also check the nutrient levels in your blood before you start taking a supplement and after consuming it for a specific period. “If you’re just starting supplementation for the first time or using it to help improve certain symptoms, in-office tests can be helpful,” Pasquariello says. “If you’re experiencing side effects from a supplement, an in-office test can also be recommended.” In general, Pasquariello says it’s always important to connect with your doctor about any supplements you’re taking to ensure they don’t interfere with any medications or treatments. Want to learn more? Get the facts below This depends on your needs. People who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should take a daily prenatal. Vitamin D may also reduce the risk of pregnancy complications like gestational diabetes. Infants who aren’t formula-fed need daily vitamin D, or the lactating parent can supplement with vitamin D. Other potentially important supplements include magnesium, iron, and omega 3s, but always talk to your doctor before you start supplementation, especially when it comes to iron. Discuss this with your doctor or a dietician. The answer will depend on whether you are pregnant or lactating, age, diet, and health needs. Not all vegans and vegetarians require supplementation, but Pasquariello says B12 is the most common deficiency. For those on the keto diet, Pasquariello suggests discussing vitamin D and calcium supplementation with your doctor. Burdeos and Greunke say creatine monohydrate can help build muscle. The “buffered” kind is unnecessary and not supported by data. Most experts don’t believe vitamins or supplements are necessary for weight loss. Instead, work with a healthcare professional or dietician on meeting your goals through sustainable diet and lifestyle tweaks. Women don’t necessarily need special supplements, but experts say pregnant people should take prenatal vitamins with folate and iron. Ask your doctor for the best option for you. It’s recommended that people begin taking prenatal vitamins three months before trying to become pregnant. Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy may protect against pre-eclampsia, pre-term birth, and gestational diabetes. Vitamins, minerals, and supplements are buzzy, but most people get enough nutrients from diet alone. However, there are cases where supplementation is necessary, like during pregnancy or lactation. It’s important to remember that the vitamin and supplement industry isn’t regulated by the FDA. Talk to your doctor about any supplements you’re considering to ensure they’re safe for you.

If you do not get enough omega-3s in your diet from fatty fish, you may choose to get some of these essential fatty acids from a supplement. These come in different forms, like fish oil and algal oil. Omega-3 fatty acids are important for health and help support essential body functions, such as brain health. There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids: The best way to get enough is to eat whole foods rich in omega-3s, like fatty fish. But if you don’t eat a lot of fatty fish, taking a supplement may help. While different omega-3 supplements are available, not all have the same health benefits. This detailed guide explains everything you need to know about omega-3 supplements. Fish oil comes in both natural and processed forms. Processing can affect the form of the fatty acids. This is important because the body absorbs some forms better than others. All of these forms have health benefits, but research suggests the absorption of omega-3 from ethyl esters is not as good as from the other forms, although they all increase EPA and DHA in the bloodstream. Research also suggests that many health benefits of eating fatty fish do not necessarily extend to supplements. This is the oil that comes from the tissue of oily fish, mainly in the form of triglycerides. It’s the closest thing you can get to real fish. Natural fish oil contains several important nutrients. While the amount may vary between fish species, 1,000 mg of fish oil often contains about 180 mg EPA and 120 mg DHA. Natural fish oil also contains vitamins A and D. Sources of natural fish oil typically include fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as: These oils are available in capsules or liquid form. Read more about the benefits of taking fish oil. Processed fish oil is purified, concentrated, or both. It consists of ethyl esters or triglycerides. Purification removes contaminants such as mercury and PCBs from the oil. Concentrating the oil can also increase EPA and DHA levels. Processed fish oils make up most of the fish oil market, as they’re cheap and usually come in capsules. However, your body doesn’t absorb processed or natural fish oil in the ethyl ester form. Some manufacturers process the oil even further to convert it back into a synthetic triglyceride form, which is well absorbed. These oils are referred to as reformed (or re-esterified) triglycerides. Although they’re the most expensive fish oil supplements , they only make up a small percentage of the market. Ethyl esters may also be more prone to oxidation and rancidity than triglycerides. However, manufacturers can take steps to improve the stability of processed fish oils, including limiting the amount of oxygen in the product and its packaging. Read about the benefits of fish oil for brain health. Krill oil is extracted from Antarctic krill, a small shrimp-like animal. Krill oil contains omega-3s in both triglyceride and phospholipid form. Numerous studies have shown that omega-3 is absorbed just as well from the phospholipids in krill oil as from the triglycerides in fish oil, and sometimes better . Krill oil is highly resistant to oxidation, as it naturally contains a potent antioxidant called astaxanthin. Additionally, krill are very small and have a short life span, so they don’t accumulate many contaminants like mercury during their lifetime. Their oil doesn’t need to be purified and is rarely found in the ethyl ester form. The green-lipped mussel is native to New Zealand, and its oil is usually triglycerides or free fatty acids. In addition to EPA and DHA, it also contains trace amounts of eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA). This rare omega-3 fatty acid may also help reduce inflammation. Consuming green-lipped mussel oil is also considered to be environmentally friendly. ALA is short for alpha-linolenic acid. It’s the plant form of omega-3s. The following foods contain high amounts of ALA oil: Your body can convert ALA into EPA or DHA, but this process is inefficient. According to the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements, the best way to get EPA and DHA is to consume them directly, whether from food or supplements. Most plant oils also contain more omega-6s than omega-3s. Marine algae, particularly microalgae, are another triglyceride source of EPA and DHA. The EPA and DHA in fish originate in algae. Smaller fish eat the algae, and it moves up the food chain from there. Algal oil can be a particularly good source of DHA and EPA for vegetarians and vegans. It may also contain important minerals like iodine . Furthermore, algal oil is considered environmentally friendly. It doesn’t contain any contaminants, such as heavy metals, which makes it a sustainable, healthy option. A regular fish oil supplement is probably the best choice for most people looking to improve their well-being. However, remember that natural fish oil usually consists of no more than 30% EPA and DHA, which means 70% is other fats. You can also buy supplements that contain a higher concentration of omega-3s. EPA and DHA can be as high as 90%. For best results, look for brands that contain omega-3s as free fatty acids. Triglycerides or phospholipids are good as well. Omega-3 capsules are usually made from a soft layer of gelatin, and many manufacturers also use an enteric coating to keep the capsule from dissolving until it reaches your small intestine. This is common in fish oil capsules, as it prevents fishy-tasting burps. However, it can also mask the foul smell of rancid fish oil. If you take omega-3 capsules, it may be a good idea to open one occasionally and smell it to ensure it hasn’t gone rancid. Read about our top picks for the best fish oil supplements. When shopping for an omega-3 supplement, always read the label carefully and choose a variety that has undergone third-party testing . The FDA does not monitor the contents of supplements like they do medications. Over time, independent research has found that some supplements may not contain the ingredients or amounts indicated on the label. Research from 2015 found that omega-3 fatty acid supplements were no exception. The researchers found that only 70% of the supplements tested contained what they said they did on the label. When reading the level, look for the following: The FDA recommends that your daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids not exceed 3 grams (3000 mg) of EPA and DHA combined, with no more than 2 grams (2000 mg) deriving from supplements. A regular fish oil supplement is probably sufficient for most people who do not get enough fatty fish in their diet. However, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), eating seafood, particularly fatty fish, may have more health benefits than taking fish oil or other supplements. However, make sure the supplement contains what it says it does, and pay special attention to the EPA and DHA content. EPA and DHA are most often found in animal-based omega-3 products. Vegetarian options are available, but they usually only contain ALA. One exception is algal oil, which provides an excellent source of quality omega-3s and is suitable for everyone, including vegans. It’s best to take these supplements with a meal that contains fat , as fat increases your absorption of omega-3s. Finally, omega-3s are perishable, just like fish, so avoid buying them in bulk.

    "text": "Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Nearly everyone has an answer to the question ‘what’s your favorite food?.’ It’s easy to see why: humans are wired to derive pleasure from food. In fact, for many, eating ranks among the greatest pleasures in life! Besides making mealtimes an enjoyable experience, taking pleasure from food also has significant benefits for health. Savoring food supports digestion, can help improve your relationship with food, can help overcome disordered eating and more. In some cases, getting enough “vitamin P” (or perhaps vitamin mmmm ) is just as important as the contents of your plate. Read on to dive into the tasty delights of why pleasure matters for food. For years, researchers have studied the science behind eating for pleasure. Their findings are intriguing and largely encouraging. Physiologically, the pleasure people derive from food occurs both in our mouths and in our brains. “Pleasure of any kind, including pleasure from food, leads to a release of dopamine in the brain,” explains therapist, dietitian, and Certified Body Trust provider Aleta Storch, RDN, MHC, of Wise Heart Nutrition and Wellness . “Dopamine is often referred to as the ‘feel good hormone’ because it activates the reward pathways in the brain, which helps to promote happiness, calmness, motivation, and focus,” she says. In fact, some older 2011 research indicates that people with obesity may have disrupted dopamine sensitivity, leading them to overeat to achieve adequate pleasure from food. When brain chemistry is working properly, however, our enjoyment of food can lead to physical benefits. “When we enjoy the food we are eating and stimulate dopamine, we actually digest and metabolize it more effectively,” says Storch. “When we’re relaxed in response to having a pleasurable eating experience, our nervous system goes into rest and digest mode, which allows us to fully break down and utilize the nutrients from the foods we eat.” Eating for pleasure could promote healthier eating too. A large systematic review from 2020 examined 119 studies about the connection between food enjoyment and a healthy diet. Fifty-seven percent of the studies found favorable associations between eating pleasure and dietary outcomes. One study from 2015 , for example, associated greater eating pleasure with higher nutritional status. Other studies have emphasized the importance of taking pleasure from healthy foods to promote a nourishing, balanced diet. “There’s this belief that ‘healthy’ food has to be bland or it doesn’t taste good, but that’s just not true,” says dietitian and certified intuitive eating counselor Sarah Gold Anzlovar, MS, RDN, LDN . “When we eat food that we enjoy, satisfaction increases, which can actually improve diet quality and reduce the chance of overeating or binge episodes.” Mealtimes would be pretty boring if food was just fuel. Eating casts a wide net across the human experience, from bringing us together with loved ones to connecting us to our cultural heritage . In short, food is emotional as well as physical nourishment. Here are some of the ways enjoying food can feed your spirit. What’s a party or family gathering without something to munch on? As people enjoy meals with others, it often contributes to an increased sense of happiness, according to a 2015 study on Thai social communities. Warm chicken soup when you’re sick , a pasta that reminds you of your grandmother, or the favorite dessert that always seems to hit the spot: foods like these have a way of lifting our spirits and soothing our bodies. “Sometimes food even offers comfort at the end of a challenging day, which many people associate as negative emotional eating,” says Anzlovar. “But when we allow ourselves to connect with the food and enjoy it, there are many benefits.” Diet culture has multiple definitions, but one hallmark of this societal-level messaging is that you have to say no to foods you love, especially if they’re high in calories or fat. Choosing to mindfully enjoy what you eat helps break this harmful mentality. “When all foods are allowed without rules—including the most delicious ones, the body learns to trust that it will get what it needs,” says Storch. “Creating permission for these foods that have been labeled as ‘bad’ or ‘off-limits’ is an important step in the healing process, and can help someone to feel more peace, confidence, and freedom around food.” For decades, research has demonstrated that a sense of belonging is vital to mental health. What more beautiful place to experience belonging than within your family or cultural heritage? Here’s where food enjoyment could play a major role. “Culture and tradition serve as a form of connection with others and ourselves,” says Storch. “Restricting or denying foods that promote connection can lead to disengagement and loneliness. By omitting cultural foods, we are saying not only that the food is ‘bad’ but that the underlying identity associated with the food is ‘bad.’” Embracing these foods could ultimately create a sense of freedom and belonging that elevate your mental health. You’ve probably heard that emotional eating isn’t ideal. Turning to food to deal with difficult emotions like stress, anger, or sadness often results in mindless consumption and creates a fraught relationship with food. That said, it’s understandable if you’re wary of the idea of eating for pleasure. Fortunately, emotional eating and eating for pleasure differ in both their intent and their outcomes. “Emotional eating is when people are using food as a way to cope with both positive or negative emotions,” says Anzlovar. “Eating for pleasure is choosing a food to specifically enjoy its taste, texture, and experience, such as when you go out for an ice cream cone in the summer or eat an apple straight from the tree at an apple orchard.” Another major distinction between these two behaviors is the connection you feel toward your food. “Often, though not always, there is a lack of connection or disassociation with the food when people emotionally eat,” Anzlovar explains. “When eating for pleasure, there’s usually a true connection and enjoyment that you are getting from the food.” Of course, there’s no perfectly drawn line between emotional eating and eating for enjoyment—and sometimes the two may overlap. One way to tell which you’re practicing: How do you feel afterward? Making a point to mindfully enjoy your food won’t leave you with feelings of guilt or shame. If you or a loved one is struggling with an eating disorder (or are concerned about developing one), seek help from a qualified provider as soon as possible. You can start with the National Eating Disorders Association’s Help and Support page , which offers a screening tool, hotline, and provider database. Few things in life match the everyday joy of food enjoyment. The food we consume nourishes our bodies, comforts our spirits, and pleases our taste buds. To bring more pleasure to your table, try starting small. “When you make a meal or snack, see if there is anything you could do to make it even 10 percent more enjoyable,” recommends Storch. “Sometimes, heating up a brownie, throwing some goat cheese on a salad, or adding more milk to thin out a bowl of oatmeal can take an eating experience from ‘meh’ to ‘yeah’!” Finally, when mealtime is over, ask: How much pleasure did your food provide? What positive feelings resulted from connecting emotionally with the items on your plate? The mental notes you gather could help make future food choices even more delicious.

As we chug along into a new year, interest in plant-based protein shows no signs of slowing down. According to the International Food Information Council’s 2022 Food and Health Survey , 12 percent of Americans now follow a plant-based diet and 31 percent say they’ve been eating more food from whole-plant sources. Meanwhile, there’s no shortage of novel plant-forward protein sources to choose from, with new powders, milks, and meat substitutes emerging every month. And, of course, old standbys like beans, quinoa, and tofu are always available to add animal-free protein to your diet too. Considering leaning more on plants to fill you up, build your muscles, and even help you lose weight? Here’s an overview of the latest science behind plant-based proteins, when to use them, and why they make a difference to the environment and your health. When comparing plant-based protein to animal protein, there are plenty of factors to consider, from taste to cost. But if you’re turning to plants for a health purpose, it’s helpful to look at the science behind their benefits. Vegetarians (and their well-meaning mothers) have long been concerned about obtaining so-called “complete” protein from plant sources. Complete proteins are those that provide all nine essential amino acids the body can’t produce on its own and must get from food. Many vegan proteins don’t contain all the essential amino acids, leading some people to believe that they must mix and match their menu to create the right balance. A common example is combining rice and beans. However, many experts now say that pairing specific vegetarian foods for their amino acids probably isn’t necessary . A well-balanced diet is likely to supply sufficient amounts of all 20 amino acids, both essential and non-essential. In fact, a 2019 study on people following vegan and vegetarian diets found that they received more-than-adequate protein and amino acids. The authors of the study also went so far as to say that the concept of amino acid deficiency has been “substantially overstated.” Still, there is one nutrient where plant-based proteins can’t compete with their animal counterparts: vitamin B12, responsible for proper brain function and red blood cell formation. If you choose to go totally vegan, you’ll likely need to add this nutrient to your diet with a supplement. Opting for plant proteins over animal ones is likely to produce positive health effects. Studies have associated plant-based diets with healthy weight maintenance , lower risk of type 2 diabetes , and even longer life . Still, there are a few caveats. Some plant-based protein foods (like plant-based meats and cheeses) are highly processed, which could come with some unpleasant surprises for health. “Depending on the type, the sodium and saturated fat content (components many of us may want to reduce) could be comparable or even higher than meat,” says Christine Milmine, RDN, founder of Plant Powered You . “However, the opposite may be true as well, so check the nutrition facts panel.” Plant-based dietitian Amy Gorin, MS, RDN , owner of Plant-Based with Amy , agrees that it’s best to limit ultra-processed plant-based convenience foods. “Options such as plant-based meat are delicious and keep things interesting, but these are a food I recommend eating in moderation and not with every meal,” she says. People with allergies to soy or nuts (two of the eight most common food allergens) may also find a diet high in plant-based protein tricky to follow. And folks with digestive issues like irritable bowel syndrome may need to be careful with the higher fiber content of many plant-based foods. Another concern that requires clarifying: the health effects of soy. For years, soy foods have been plagued by rumors that they alter hormone balance or even cause cancer. Fortunately, current research shows that there’s little reason for concern around including a tofu-packed stir-fry or steamed edamame at dinner. A 2020 study that tracked over 300,000 women revealed that eating soy foods actually reduced their chances of developing breast cancer. Meanwhile, the American Cancer Society contends that soy foods are both healthy and safe. Eating more plant-based proteins not only nourishes your body, it can help restore the planet! A 2019 study showed that shifting from an omnivore diet to veganism reduced personal greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent, while moving to a lacto-ovo-vegetarian eating pattern brought them down by 35 percent. Water usage is another key area where plant proteins outshine animal ones. According to data from the Water Footprint Network , an advocacy group devoted to solving the world’s water crisis, meats like beef, poultry, and pork use significantly more water than plant-based proteins like pulses, nuts, and cereal grains. The water footprint of beef, for example, is six times higher than that of pulses. The environmental effects of scaling back meat consumption are so noteworthy that the U.N.’s 2019 climate change report called for a global reduction of animal protein . Even if you don’t elect to go fully plant-based with your protein consumption, you might consider making some smaller tweaks to promote planetary health. Have more questions about plant-based protein? Get the facts below. The best plant-based foods are those that provide not only ample protein, but other benefits too. For starters, you can’t go wrong with beans. “Beans are unique in that they contain fiber, whereas animal protein does not,” Milmine points out. “Dietary fiber has been associated with many benefits such as digestive health and reducing the risk of certain conditions.” Gorin recommends tofu. “I love tofu because it’s so versatile. It picks up the flavor of whatever it’s cooked with,” she says. Plus, tofu may not be as allergenic as was once believed. “You might be worried that soybeans are one of the top major food allergens, but soybean allergies are actually less common than you might think,” she says. “A study in Nutrition Today shows that the prevalence of soybean allergies is lower than the prevalence of the other top seven allergens that include milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and wheat.” Nuts make another excellent plant protein choice for their convenience and versatility (not to mention their crunch!). Gorin, who is a nutrition partner with Wonderful Pistachios, encourages incorporating the bite-sized green nuts in meals and snacks. “Pistachios offer 6 grams of protein per quarter-cup serving. They’re one of the highest-protein snack nuts out there.” Anyone can (and should!) enjoy whole, plant-based foods in a balanced diet. But some people will need to exercise caution around certain plant foods. Those on a reduced-sodium or reduced-fat diet will need to check labels on highly processed plant-based foods like faux burgers, bacon, and cheeses. Similarly, if you have an allergy to plant foods like nuts or soy, be sure to read ingredient lists to avoid these elements. And if excess fiber is a concern, choose your plant-based protein sources wisely. Soy milk and tofu, for example, provide plenty of protein with minimal fiber. The merits of plant-based protein powder versus whey powder are hotly debated in the nutrition world. Both powders help build muscle and support weight loss, but plant-based options don’t always feature complete proteins and may not contain as many grams per scoop. On the other hand, some people find plant-based powders easier to digest because they don’t contain lactose. If you’re vegan, you’ll also want to steer clear of whey powder, since it’s derived from cow’s milk. Flavor preferences may vary, but judging by online reviews, certain protein powders are the tastiest cream of the plant-based crop. Orgain’s Organic Superfood Powder in vanilla bean flavor has over 40,000 Amazon reviews, 77 percent of them five-star. Numerous other flavors, from chocolate to strawberries and cream, are available from thousands of brands. With some personal taste testing, you’re likely to find a powder that suits your taste buds. Whether you prefer tofu, beans, nuts, or a combination of all of the above, plant-based proteins have so much to offer. They’re usually inexpensive, packed with nutrients, and come in a delicious palette of flavors. With all the environmental and personal benefits of these vegetarian macros — and with myths about their inferior stature debunked — there’s little to keep you from making friends with plants.

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that plays a number of critical roles in your body. This nutrient is especially important for immune system health, leaving many people wondering whether supplementing with vitamin D may help reduce the risk of contracting the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. While antivirals like Paxlovid show promise as a treatmen t for COVID-19, preventive measures like physical distancing and proper hygiene can protect you from contracting the virus. Also, some research shows that having healthy levels of vitamin D can help keep your immune system healthy and may protect against respiratory illnesses in general. This article explains how vitamin D affects immune health and how supplementing with this nutrient may help protect against respiratory conditions. Vitamin D is necessary for the proper functioning of your immune system — which is your body’s first line of defense against infection and disease. This vitamin plays a critical role in promoting immune response. It has both anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties, and is crucial for the activation of immune system defenses ( 1 ). Vitamin D is known to enhance the function of immune cells, including T cells and macrophages, that protect your body against pathogens ( 2 ). In fact, the vitamin is so important for immune function that low levels of vitamin D have been associated with increased susceptibility to infection, disease, and immune-related disorders ( 3 ). For example, low vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk of respiratory diseases, including tuberculosis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as viral and bacterial respiratory infections ( 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ). What’s more, vitamin D deficiency has been linked to decreased lung function, which may affect your body’s ability to fight respiratory infections ( 8 , 9 ). Vitamin D is critical for immune function. A deficiency in this nutrient may compromise immune response and increase your risk of infection and disease. Few studies have investigated the effect of vitamin D supplements or vitamin D deficiency on the risk of contracting COVID-19 . Still, studies have shown that vitamin D deficiency may harm immune function and increase your risk of developing respiratory illnesses ( 10 ). Additionally, some studies have indicated that vitamin D supplements can enhance immune response and protect against respiratory infections overall. A recent review that included 11,321 people from 14 countries demonstrated that supplementing with vitamin D decreased the risk of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in both those who had deficient and adequate levels of vitamin D. Overall, the study showed that vitamin D supplements reduced the risk of developing at least one ARI by 12%. The protective effect was strongest in those with low vitamin D levels ( 11 ). Moreover, the review found that vitamin D supplements were most effective at protecting against ARI when taken daily or weekly in small doses and less effective when taken in larger, widely spaced doses ( 12 ). Vitamin D supplements have also been shown to reduce mortality in older adults, who are most at risk of developing respiratory illnesses like COVID-19 ( 13 ). What’s more, vitamin D deficiency is known to enhance a process known as the “cytokine storm” ( 14 ). Cytokines are proteins that are an integral part of the immune system. They can have both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects and play important roles, helping protect against infection and disease ( 15 , 16 ). However, cytokines can also induce tissue damage under certain circumstances. A cytokine storm refers to the uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that takes place in response to infection or other factors. This dysregulated and excessive release of cytokines leads to severe tissue damage and enhances disease progression and severity ( 17 ). In fact, it’s a major cause of multiple organ failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as an important factor in the progression and severity of COVID-19 ( 17 ). For example, patients with severe cases of COVID-19 have been shown to release large numbers of cytokines, particularly interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) ( 18 ). Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with reduced immune function and may enhance the cytokine storm. As such, researchers postulate that a vitamin D deficiency may increase the risk of severe COVID-19 complications, as well as that vitamin D supplementation may reduce complications related to cytokine storms and uncontrolled inflammation in people with COVID-19 ( 19 , 20 ). Currently, multiple clinical trials are investigating the effects of vitamin D supplementation (at dosages up to 200,000 IU) in people with COVID-19 ( 19 , 21 ). Although research in this area is ongoing, it’s important to understand that taking supplemental vitamin D alone can’t protect you from developing COVID-19. However, being deficient in vitamin D may increase your susceptibility to overall infection and disease by harming immune function. This is especially worrisome given that many people are deficient in vitamin D, especially older individuals who are most at risk of developing serious COVID-19-related complications ( 22 ). For these reasons, it’s a good idea to have your healthcare provider test your vitamin D levels to determine whether you have a deficiency in this important nutrient. This is particularly important during winter months. Depending on your blood levels, supplementing with 1,000–4,000 IU of vitamin D per day is typically sufficient for most people. However, those with low blood levels will often require much higher doses to increase their levels to an optimal range ( 23 ). Though recommendations on what constitutes an optimal vitamin D level vary, most experts agree that optimal vitamin D levels lie between 30–60 ng/mL (75–150 nmol/L) ( 24 , 25 ). Though research continues, evidence that vitamin D supplements reduce the risk of developing COVID-19 is still limited. Having healthy vitamin D levels can enhance immune health and may be helpful in people with COVID-19. Vitamin D plays many important roles in your body, including promoting the health of your immune system. Scientific research suggests that supplementing with vitamin D may protect against respiratory infections, especially among those who are deficient in the vitamin. Recent research indicates that sufficient vitamin D levels may help people with COVID-19 avoid adverse outcomes. Still, we don’t know whether taking vitamin D supplements reduces your risk of developing COVID-19 as a result of contracting the coronavirus.

    "text": "Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Culture refers to the ideas, customs, and behaviors of a group of people or a society ( 1 ). It influences just about everything you do — the way you speak, the foods you eat, what you consider to be right or wrong, your religious and spiritual practices, and even your perspective of wellness, healing, and healthcare ( 2 ). However, culture is a complex and fluid concept with numerous ethnocultural communities, identities, and cross-cultural practices ( 1 , 3 ). This diversity presents a challenge to the healthcare industry and providers, who must be adequately trained and skilled to include the nuances of culture in their consultations and recommendations. In the field of dietetics, culturally appropriate nutrition guidelines and nutrition therapy recommendations are essential. The absence of cultural competence among dietitians may perpetuate health inequities and disparities among marginalized and diverse communities. This article explains all you need to know about cultural competence in dietetics, why it matters, and steps practitioners can take to become more culturally competent. Cultural competence is the willingness and ability to treat a patient effectively and appropriately without the influence of bias, prejudice, or stereotypes ( 3 ). It requires respecting others’ attitudes, beliefs, and values while evaluating your own and becoming comfortable with any differences that arise. Differences are often seen in race, ethnicity, religion, and food practices. As a framework developed in the 1980s, cultural competence in the health industry seeks to make healthcare services more acceptable, accessible, relatable, and effective for individuals from diverse backgrounds ( 1 , 2 ). In nutrition, it’s a group of strategies meant to address cultural diversity and challenge the cookie-cutter approach to nutrition education and dietary interventions among ethnocultural communities. This includes nutrition guidelines and illustrations representing diverse food cultures with an expanded definition of “healthy eating.” It involves nutritionists and dietitians knowledgeable and skilled in cultural counseling techniques including culture in the discussions and recommendations. They provide unbiased nutrition services that do not undermine culture’s influence on lifestyle, food choices, and eating patterns. Cultural competence overlaps with cultural sensitivity, awareness, and cultural safety, encompassing more than just race/ethnicity and religion, and it’s careful not to mislabel based on stereotypes ( 1 , 3 ). A major aim of cultural competence is to build a system of trained healthcare professionals capable of providing tailored, culturally appropriate expertise ( 1 ). Cultural competence is a framework developed to make healthcare services more accessible and effective for diverse ethnic communities. It’s a group of strategies that challenge the approach to nutrition education and dietary interventions. Social determinants of health must be interpreted and understood within the context of systemic racism and how it affects different cultures and ethnicities ( 3 , 4 ). These determinants — including socioeconomic status, education, food insecurity, housing, employment, and food access — lead to social gradients and health inequities ( 1 , 4 ). These health inequities and subsequent health disparities are amplified among marginalized, red-lined, and underserved populations who may lack access to nutritious foods and food security. Culture also influences the client’s perspective on health and healing, their use of medication versus alternative therapies, and their food choices and eating patterns. Models of cultural competence exist and are promoted through nutrition textbooks, practicums, and internships to improve dietitians’ skills related to addressing ethnocultural diversity ( 5 ). However, clinical practice guidelines, meal planning, healthy eating, and medical nutrition therapy are often presented in a decontextualized manner ( 1 ). The encounter between dietitian and patient is shaped by the differences in their cultures, biases, prejudices, and stereotypes ( 1 ). If a dietitian does not effectively manage these differences, a breakdown in trust, communication, and compliance with the nutrition plan may further propagate poor health outcomes. Dietitians and nutritionists must acknowledge these diverse influences to cultivate an atmosphere of trust and develop an affinity with patients, enabling them to communicate an effective nutrition plan and yield greater compliance and good health outcomes. Furthermore, healthy eating looks different across ethnocultural communities and geographical locations based on food accessibility, sustainability, and food cultures. Health disparities may develop if dietitians fail to give culturally competent nutrition interventions. And while cultural competency is not a panacea for health disparities, more thorough communication with the client promotes better health outcomes ( 3 ). Nutrition advice needs to be responsive, appropriate, and effectively matched to the client’s lifestyle, living conditions, dietary needs, and food culture. As such, cultural competence is a crucial skill for dietitians and healthcare professionals alike. To address health inequities and disparities, the social determinants of health must be understood within the context of culture and reflected through unbiased, culturally appropriate, and respectful nutrition services. Below are some real-life scenarios that observe the breakdown in communication that cultural barriers can cause due to inadequate or inappropriate cultural competence. While reviewing these scenarios, you can consider solutions that could improve the outcome of similar future events. An Indian patient with a high-risk pregnancy and prediabetes struggles to make the appropriate dietary changes to support her blood sugar management. Her comfort food is dhal (puréed split pea soup) made by her mother. At her third visit, the visibly irritated dietitian reiterates that the patient simply needs to stop eating too many carb-rich foods and ends the consultation. The patient, who is recovering from a stroke, could not communicate directly with the healthcare team. The hospital’s menu contained items unfamiliar to the patient, and his relative prepared cultural foods for his consumption. The dietitian couldn’t find comparable ingredients in the institutional nutrient analysis software, and the calorie count was foregone — using Ensure supplement intake to estimate overall intake. Unfamiliar with cornmeal — ground maize — the dietitian did not understand the composition of the client’s meals and how to provide culturally appropriate recommendations. The client also struggled to describe her dishes, which used starches not commonly found in the American diet. This and the previous scenarios represent challenges with cultural competence, communication, and trust across interpersonal and institutional levels. A lack of cultural competence creates a barrier to effective communication. These are missed opportunities to provide appropriate nutrition interventions tailored to the patient’s dietary and health needs. Change is required at both institutional and individual levels — and there’s evidence that this reduces health disparities ( 1 ). Performing a self-assessment of your own beliefs, values, biases, prejudices, and stereotypes is the first step to becoming culturally competent ( 3 ). Be cognizant of what you bring to the table — both positive and negative biases — and become comfortable with the differences that may arise between you and someone from a different ethnocultural background. People do not need to be the same to be respected. Here’s a list to help you get started: The forms of help that are available in a healthcare system reflect the value it places on cultural knowledge and practices ( 1 , 2 ). The inability to access culturally appropriate nutrition and dietary services is a form of social inequity and health disparity. Institutions can seek to improve how they engage with and empower members of marginalized communities ( 1 ). Here are some suggestions for improving cultural competence at the institutional level: Change is required at both individual and institutional levels to build culturally competent nutritionists and dietitians and a supportive healthcare environment capable of reducing health disparities. Some literature suggests that cultural competence is insufficient — that simply making nutritionists and dietitians aware of cultural differences is not enough to stop stereotyping and affect change ( 1 ). Furthermore, some cultural competence movements may be purely cosmetic or superficial. The concepts of cultural safety and cultural humility have been proposed as more inclusive and systematic approaches to dismantling institutional discrimination ( 1 ). Cultural safety looks beyond an individual dietitian’s skills to create a work environment that’s a safe cultural space for the patient, one that’s sensitive and responsive to their various belief systems ( 1 ). Meanwhile, cultural humility is viewed as a more reflexive approach, going beyond just acquiring knowledge and involves an ongoing self-exploration and self-critique process, combined with a willingness to learn from others ( 6 ). To demean or disempower a patient’s cultural identity is considered a culturally unsafe practice ( 7 ). However, although some patients may feel safe and understood concerning institutional cultural competence and ethnic matching of dietitian and patient, others may feel singled out and exposed to racial prejudice ( 1 ). Implementation of cultural competence in clinical practice may also extend consultation times, as it requires more dialogue with the patient. Interestingly, not every non-Western practice is going to be the best intervention. It’s essential to move away from the notion that any one style of eating is bad — the way Western eating has been demonized — to addressing eating patterns that may be harmful regardless of origin. There are downsides to cultural competence that create further challenges to institutionalizing it, including cosmetic movements, lack of inclusivity, and unintentional prejudice. Within the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) and independent organizations, several Member Interest Groups advocate diversifying nutrition to make it inclusive. These include: Member Interest Groups and other non-academy organizations are pivoting dietitians’ roles as advocates of cultural competence in dietetics and food access. Cultural competence is the willingness and ability to provide unbiased, judgment-free nutrition services to people and clients of diverse cultural backgrounds. Cultural competence and cultural safety intersect and demand institutional changes to facilitate the forms of help available to minority and marginalized communities. However, culture is a fluid concept, and nutritionists and dietitians must not assume that every member of a specific ethnic group identifies and complies with that group’s commonly known cultural practices. They may have adapted their own values and practices. Dietitians should remain impartial and engage clients in meaningful conversations that will equip them with the information they need to provide culturally appropriate, respectful guidance.

If you’ve ever enjoyed the glorious combination that is pasta and cheese, you know that quick, delicious meals don’t always take fancy ingredients to create. When a busy schedule has you on the run, wouldn’t it be nice if every meal was so easy? The key may be in having the right ingredients constantly on-hand. By stocking your kitchen with a few strategic basics, quick, easy meals don’t have to be a magical unicorn. Like a well-curated wardrobe, a well-dressed pantry features foods that mix and match beautifully for all sorts of mealtime combos. The goal: Get dinner on the table with as little effort as possible. The materials: these 15 staples. You can think of black beans as the little black dress of dinnertime. They slip comfortably into almost anything. Try them in: Try whipping up these black bean burgers for your next Meatless Monday. A half-can of leftover black beans might not seem super inspiring, but it can be the start of a unique second meal. Mash the beans and spread them on flatbread for a creative Southwestern pizza topped with tomatoes, melted cheddar, and cilantro, or toss a few atop baked sweet potatoes sprinkled with chili powder, oregano, salt, and pepper. If there were an award for all-around highly nutritious foods, black beans would be a top contender. They’re high in both protein and fiber, two nutrients known for helping maintain a healthy weight. They’re also rich in antioxidants and may promote blood sugar control . For a quick and easy meal, you can’t go wrong with the pre-cooked convenience of rotisserie chicken. Just strip the meat off the bones and you’re ready to rock. Add a little chicken to one of the dishes below for a bit of added protein. One possibility: Simmer up a 15-minute white chicken chili with rotisserie chicken, white beans, green chilies, chicken broth, and a dash of cumin. If you have time, consider removing the meat from a rotisserie chicken as soon as you bring it home, then store it in the fridge. That way, dinner prep will happen even faster. Or keep a sealed container of the meat in your freezer for up to 6 months. Rotisserie chicken does tend to contain more sodium than straight-up chicken breasts or thighs, but its protein content is the same as any other chicken. A 3-ounce serving of the meat contains 24 grams of protein for building strong muscles and supporting your immune system. Come dinnertime, frozen meatballs can totally save your bacon — or get wrapped in it! These meaty mealtime starters can add heft to Italian subs with the addition of marinara and mozzarella. Want to add some green? Add a handful of spinach or arugula. Or microwave them for a shortcut to Swedish meatballs over egg noodles. Once you’ve cooked frozen meatballs, it’s best not to re-freeze them. Stash them in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Pull them out for later use in wraps, spaghetti, or albondigas. Frozen meatballs aren’t necessarily brimming with antioxidants or healthy fats—but they are an excellent source of: Just read labels to be sure you know what you’re getting. Typically, a shorter ingredient list indicates a less processed product. Another easy protein to the rescue: canned tuna! Unlike fresh fish, which requires cooking, canned tuna is a quick route to oodles of lunches and dinners. For example, enjoy Mediterranean-style pasta featuring your favorite noodles. Add: Or hollow out a large fresh heirloom tomato and serve tuna salad inside. A wee bit of extra tuna can hang out in your fridge for 1 or 2 days. Try mixing it with mayo and using it to top sliced cucumbers for a mini appetizer. Besides its noteworthy protein content, canned tuna shines for its omega-3 fatty acids . These healthy fats have been linked to health benefits galore, from reduced risk of cardiovascular disease to better sleep . When even pasta takes too long, turn to couscous . It can hit the table after just a 3-minute spin in the microwave. An all-in-one couscous grain bowl makes a dinner that’s not just quick, but portable too. Cooked couscous lasts in the refrigerator for about 3 days. When you’ve staggered through the door after a crazy day, a container in the fridge is an instant side dish for meats or a perfect foundation for a casserole. If you don’t mind splurging, opt for whole wheat couscous. It provides more fiber than the refined variety, helping optimize digestion, keeping you full, and feeding the healthy bacteria in your gut . Sourdough is a king among bread. It’s equally at home as the crust of an egg bake, the underpinnings of an impromptu pizza, or the heart and soul of French toast. And of course, there’s always sourdough avocado toast. Crunch, crunch, crunch… so many dishes can get a textural update from crispy bread crumbs. Try sprinkling them on mac and cheese, stuffed squash, or green beans. To do it, toast extra sourdough bread and process it in the food processor until it turns to a crumbl-like consistency. You can also freeze sourdough for about 3 months. Who said bread isn’t healthy? Sourdough contains live and active cultures that promote gut health and may be easier to digest than regular bread because of the fermentation process. Tortillas can go far beyond the realm of Mexican food—though they certainly don’t have to! Besides the usual tortas, tostadas, and enchiladas, try a flour tortilla as a vehicle for a lunchtime veggie wrap. Or, for a kid-pleasing lunchbox centerpiece, try this: It’s not hard to find a use for an extra tortilla or two. Finish off the package by wrapping up a leftover green salad, roasted veggies, or scrambled eggs. Or go for a classic microwave quesadilla! Each type of tortilla—flour, corn, spinach, etc.—comes with its own nutrient profile, so they’re somewhat difficult to compare. Tortillas alone are a good source of a few nutrients like B vitamins. Plus, their hand-held convenience can help you pack in more nutrients from veggies, beans, and lean proteins. Choose a whole-grain or corn tortilla to add even more fiber to your plate. You could simmer your own homemade marinara sauce from garden-fresh tomatoes and herbs, but for meals in a flash, jarred marinara is your friend. Not only is it an obvious choice for spaghetti or other pasta, but it can also add tomato-y oomph to DIY pizzas , sliders, and subs. Elevate pizza night (quickly) with purchased garlic naan bread, a schmear of marinara, mozzarella, diced roasted red peppers, and olives. Close the lid tightly on jarred marinara and pop it in the fridge. If you won’t use it within a week or two, stick it in the freezer instead: it will last 6 months. If you’ve got just a smidge to use up, slip it into chili or meatloaf. Everyone will wonder about the je nais se quoi ingredient that added such savory flavor. With tomatoes as its first ingredient, marinara sauce features some of their health benefits, like ample amounts of the antioxidant lycopene. Lycopene helps quell inflammation—which may be why it’s been linked to reduced risk of certain cancers and improved vascular health . However, be sure to check the ingredients and choose a jar with minimal added sugar. Vegetables like potatoes and squash take ages to soften in the oven. For a quicker route to veggie goodness, opt for jarred artichokes (choose a marinated variety for pre-infused flavor). They’re a zero-cook addition to pasta and salad, plus an elegant topper for quick-bite appetizers like crostini. An opened jar of marinated artichokes should live in the fridge for the remainder of its days. These veggies can stay good for up to 3 weeks. Artichokes are high in inflammation-fighting polyphenols , high in fiber, and low in fat. Why hassle with mincing cloves? Snagging jarred garlic means meals are a snap. Try it in: You can also try jarred garlic as the first step for a sautéed greens side dish or a surprisingly zesty pot roast . Jarred garlic can make its home in your fridge as far as its expiration date, which may be as long as 3 months from purchase. Including garlic in your diet could come with a host of health benefits. A 2020 study correlated garlic with the potential prevention of cancer, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases like diabetes. It makes the garlic breath seem a little more worth it. Frozen mixed vegetables are a cook’s best friend for loading up meals on the fly. Add them to: Having them on hand in the freezer means veggies can color up your diet with just the shake of a bag. There’s literally no easier food to store in the freezer than frozen mixed veggies. After cooking, you can preserve leftovers in the refrigerator for 5-7 days. Depending on your blend, you’ll find a mix of nutrients like: All these nutrients have a major impact! Some research has shown that vegetable consumption is inversely related to death from any cause. Hummus can become your go-to spread for far more than veggie dipping. Its creamy texture can serve as a mayo replacement in sandwiches and wraps or the base of sturdy salad dressings. It’s also a near-essential part of a charcuterie board, which just so happens to be a super easy meal. Refrigerated hummus can stay good in the fridge for 1-2 weeks. Haul it out whenever you need a quick side dish, like crackers or crudites — or spread some on toast and sprinkle with pomegranate seeds for a healthy breakfast. This gift from the Mediterranean has become the centerpiece of healthy entertaining for good reason. Tahini (sesame paste) provides healthy fats while the chickpea base comes packed with fiber and protein. People who eat more plant-based protein may have a longer life expectancy, according to 2019 research . Raw potatoes aren’t exactly helpful for dinner in a flash—but pre-mashed spuds in the freezer make quick work. Any time you need a speedy side dish, grab the bag from your freezer. It’ll start you off on the right foot as part of a quick lemon-and-capers salmon dinner . Purchased mashed potatoes can chill out in the freezer for up to 6 months. Once cooked, store them in the fridge. You can get creative with leftovers by stuffing them into samosas or enchiladas or frying them up as potato latkes. Potatoes get a bad rap for their high carb count, but they aren’t as bad for you as you might think . They have plenty of potassium, the mineral that helps your muscles and nerves contract properly, and their resistant starch might improve blood sugar control, according to a 2021 study . For an all-purpose shredded cheese that goes on just about anything, choose cheddar. Rich and easily meltable, it tames spice and tops off household favorites, like: You’ll get the best results from your shredded cheddar if you keep it tightly sealed in the fridge. Cheese can be frozen too. Leave a bag in the freezer for six to nine months. Cheddar is known for its calcium . A quarter-cup serving contains 15 percent of the Daily Value . This mineral supports: The cheese also contains a moderate amount of protein. Greek yogurt, how do we love you? Let us count the ways. Try it in: Even more ideas: Use Greek yogurt to coat chicken or pork before breading or to make tzatziki sauce for falafel. Greek yogurt will keep in the fridge for about 2 weeks. Technically, you can freeze it for up to 2 months, but this may change its consistency. Nutritionally, Greek yogurt has so many good things going for it. It offers ample protein, calcium, and gut-friendly probiotics to name a few. Good things may take time, but when it comes to making healthy meals, there’s no shame in a few shortcuts. Stock your kitchen with these combinable essentials and you won’t have to bat an eye next time you need dinner in minutes. Sarah Garone is a nutritionist, freelance writer, and food blogger.

If you’re concerned about the environment, you may wonder whether to continue eating meat. Food production has environmental impacts because it uses water and land. Therefore, eating foods that are made with fewer resources (and don’t significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions) is often said to be better for the planet. Plant foods are generally considered more eco-friendly than meat and animal products, and vegan or vegetarian diets are often labeled as sustainable. However, there are many points to consider when evaluating the environmental impact of meat. In fact, there may be ways to eat meat more sustainably — and eat less of it — without giving it up completely. This article examines the nuances of meat’s environmental footprint, then discusses tips for eating meat on an eco-friendly diet. Raising animals for food requires large amounts of land and water. It also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions through animal feed, manure, and methane that’s expelled via burping ( 1 ). In fact, livestock are responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Furthermore, raising livestock industrially leads to deforestation, soil erosion, freshwater contamination, and air pollution ( 1 , 2 ). Beef is said to have a larger environmental impact than dairy, pork, fish, eggs, or chicken, but the footprint of these foods varies based on how they’re produced ( 3 ). Whole, minimally processed plant foods like vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, and olive oil have among the lowest environmental impacts ( 3 ). Still, it’s difficult to compare every type of animal and plant product. Some plant foods, such as certain nuts and highly processed items , have much larger environmental impacts than other plant-based options. It’s also important to consider the scale of meat production — small farms versus feedlots — when assessing meat’s ecological impact, as there are many nuances in the debate about livestock’s role in climate change. While the meat industry typically uses more resources and contributes more to climate change than plant foods, certain meat production methods are more sustainable than others. Plus, although beef is widely viewed as worse for the environment than other meats, some analyses suggest otherwise. For example, beef is produced more efficiently in the United States than in most other places in the world. Innovations like better breeding and feed additives help farmers use fewer cattle to feed more people and decrease environmental impacts ( 4 , 5 ). Adjusting dairy cows’ diet to include a specific type of seaweed has been shown to improve digestion and reduce methane emissions by up to 60%. In beef cattle, the reduction in methane emissions from seaweed supplements may be up to 80% ( 6 , 7 ). Current research suggests that U.S. beef production contributes to 3.7% of national greenhouse gas emissions and under 0.5% of global emissions. The entire agriculture industry comprises 10% of U.S. emissions, while the transportation industry makes up 29% ( 8 , 9 , 10 ). Although beef cattle production emits more greenhouse gases than poultry, pork, or dairy, most U.S. cattle are raised on land that’s unfit for growing veggies and other plant foods. Using this land to raise meat may be considered an efficient way to feed people ( 9 ). Additionally, beef and other meats have health benefits. Meat is very rich in protein and contains essential micronutrients . Many communities in the United States and across the world rely on livestock for both nutrition and jobs. Plus, some people may not have access to nutritionally sufficient plant-based diets, meaning that a lower meat intake may harm their nutrition and livelihoods. Eating meat may also be an integral part of their culture or traditions . Finally, well-managed cattle can help keep soil and land healthy. Proper grazing techniques may make land more resilient to floods and keep carbon in the soil instead of emitted into the atmosphere. These techniques involve grazing cows on long grasses while preventing them from overgrazing or degrading soil with their hooves. As a result, the grasses maintain healthy, long roots that can handle water and sequester carbon in the ground ( 11 ). Grazing cows may also help prevent wildfires by decreasing the grass available to catch fire ( 12 ). All food production has some degree of environmental impact, which largely depends on the production method. Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) — known as feedlots in the beef industry — have many negative environmental effects ( 13 ). Animals in CAFOs are kept in close quarters and not allowed to graze. Not only does their manure contaminate the surrounding land, water, and air, but the crowded conditions are also a breeding ground for disease and infection that can spread to humans ( 14 ). Grass-fed, grass-finished, and pasture-raised meat and animal products are generally considered more eco-friendly than meat raised in CAFOs and feedlots. Farmers who produce these types of meat aim to restore ecosystems and reduce environmental impacts on soil and water. For example, they manage manure better than CAFOs and may use grazing techniques that promote healthy, flood-resilient land. Still, some claim that grass-fed and -finished meat may contribute more greenhouse gas emissions than other types. Grass-fed cows have a longer life than feedlot cows, thus releasing more methane via belching over their lifespan. In addition, if more people choose to eat grass-fed beef, the number of cattle and amount of land needed to produce this meat may increase ( 15 , 16 ). That said, some studies note that the increased emissions are offset by the carbon that grazing cows sequester in the soil ( 17 ). The environmental impact of meat is generally greater than that of plant foods. Meat production uses large amounts of land and resources, but some techniques related to raising animals may help maintain healthy ecosystems. Analyzing the environmental impact of meat is complicated. While some environmental advocates suggest that you should completely avoid meat and animal products to combat climate change, many other considerations support keeping animal products in eco-friendly diets. In general, eating more whole, minimally processed plant foods is a step in the right direction. These foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. Limiting overall meat intake and choosing sustainably raised animal products is also helpful. Here are some tips for incorporating meat as part of an eco-friendly diet. Check the label before purchasing meats, limiting or avoiding products that have been raised in a CAFO or feedlot. If the label doesn’t specify grass-fed or pasture-raised, it’s likely from a CAFOs. If you’re able to talk to the farmer directly, such as at a farmers market, you can inquire about the sustainability techniques he or she uses. Although grass-fed or pasture-raised cows may have higher lifetime methane emissions than conventionally raised cattle, the overall impacts upon the local ecosystem are much lower — and potentially even positive. Local farms may offer meat shares that let you purchase a package of sustainably raised meat that you pick up each week, month, or quarter. Incorporating meat in small amounts, such as in a side dish or as a garnish, may help you cut back on your overall intake. Experiment with making meals that primarily comprise plant foods but feature small amounts of meat, such as salads with beans as the main protein source plus a few slices of chicken or stir-fries with plenty of veggies and grains and a small amount of beef. Don’t force yourself to cut out meat all at once. Instead, try the following suggestions to eat less meat without eliminating it from your diet: Pick an option that works for you and go from there. You can add small amounts of meat to countless recipes without it taking center stage. For instance, 1 pound (454 grams) of ground beef can be spread across burgers, tacos , and soups. You can make burger patties with beans , a whole grain, and a small amount of beef, then alter your favorite taco recipe to use half mushrooms and half beef. Finally, cook the rest of the beef in a bean-based chili. If you’re struggling to reduce your meat intake — perhaps due to convenience or habit — focus on new foods you can try instead. Browse food blogs and cookbooks for plant-forward recipes and make it a goal to try a new dish each week. For example, if you’ve never tried lentils , experiment with dal or lentil-heavy grain bowls. Lentils can also be used to make meat-free “meatloaf” or stuffed bell peppers. Choosing grass-fed and pasture-raised meats, limiting your meat intake, stretching a single serving of meat over several dishes, and making plant foods the center of your meals allow you to support the environment without eliminating meat from your diet. Like all foods, meat takes resources to produce. While it generally has a higher environmental footprint than plant foods, the full picture is more nuanced. Animals raised in CAFOs affect soil, water, air, surrounding communities, and global warming far more than pasture-raised and grass-fed animals. Growing plant foods, on the other hand, is generally considered more eco-friendly. If you’re interested in following an eco-friendly diet, try moderating your meat intake and eating more whole, minimally processed plant foods . When you eat meat, try to choose pasture-raised, grass-fed, or sustainably raised options. Try this today: Cook pasture-raised chicken breasts in the slow cooker on low for about 6 hours, then shred them with a fork. Plan dishes that incorporate small amounts of shredded chicken, such as salads, veggie soups , and bean tacos, to stretch this meat across multiple meals.

Building Caribbean meals involves using the Caribbean food groups — staples, legumes, animal foods, and vegetables — to build tasty, nutritionally balanced meals. The Caribbean is a diverse region whose ethnic groups have distinctive traditional food practices. These practices are often honored through religious and cultural festivities, as well as a strong sense of heritage. I know this to be true in my home country of Trinidad and Tobago, where religious and ethnic holidays celebrate cultural foods and community. However, the Caribbean region and its diaspora have high rates of diet-related illnesses like anemia, diabetes, and heart disease — and these rates are increasing ( 1 , 2 ). Research shows that when presented with culturally sensitive nutrition materials, Caribbean people make healthy food and beverage choices. This is key to combatting high rates of chronic diseases ( 3 ). Thus, traditional foods may play an essential role in health, in addition to fostering connections to land, family, and customs. This article shows you how to build balanced, nutritious Caribbean meals using the multi-mix principle. Although governments across the Caribbean offer guidelines for nutritionally balanced meals, mainstream Western eating patterns like the Mediterranean diet or the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) MyPlate often dominate nutrition discourse ( 4 ). This lack of local representation may inadvertently send the message that Caribbean foods are unhealthy. Yet, there are many nutritionally diverse, healthy foods in this region. These foods are represented in the Caribbean Food and Nutrition Institute’s (CFNI) Six Food Groups guidelines and multi-mix principle, though these dietary standards haven’t been updated in 20 years ( 5 ). The Caribbean six food groups are staples, legumes, animal foods, fruits, vegetables, and fats and oils ( 5 ). The staples group — which includes rice, ground provisions (tubers), wheat, oats, corn, and starchy fruits — is always represented at each meal and forms the foundation of the Caribbean diet. Animal foods include fish, red meat, and poultry, as well as eggs and dairy products. According to the multi-mix principle, four of the six food groups — staples, animal foods, vegetables, and legumes — are fundamental to building practical, nutritionally balanced meals. This principle pairs food groups strategically so that meals provide a complement of essential nutrients through two-, three-, or four-mix combinations. You can use any of the following mixes to build balanced Caribbean meals. The multi-mix principle uses four of the six Caribbean food groups to build nutritionally balanced meals with numerous essential nutrients through two-, three-, or four-mix combinations. A two-mix is the simplest and least expensive meal combination, consisting of: When you pair a cereal grain like rice with legumes like beans, peas, or peanuts, they form a complete protein — a food that provides all nine essential amino acids in adequate amounts for good health ( 6 , 7 ). This means that you don’t need to eat meat to get quality protein. Furthermore, legumes are a rich source of fiber and health-promoting compounds like antioxidants that may improve blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels ( 8 , 9 , 10 ). Still, ground provisions (tubers), such as dasheen ( taro root ), cassava (yucca), sweet potato, yam, and eddoe (a tropical root vegetable), haven’t been shown to form a complete protein when paired with legumes, so it’s best to eat them with meat or fish. Ground provisions are underrated sources of complex carbs — dietary fiber and starches — and essential nutrients that may lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels ( 11 , 12 , 13 ). A two-mix is the simplest and most affordable combination, pairing grains like rice with legumes or meat to form a complete protein. Be sure to eat ground provisions (tubers) with meat or fish. The three-mix meal builds on the principles of the two-mix by adding non-starchy vegetables . Three of the four foundational food groups are represented at any meal: Non-starchy vegetables, which include asparagus, Brussels sprouts , cabbage, onions, tomatoes, zucchini, and more, provide small amounts of carbs per serving — about one-third the amount found in grains and cereals ( 4 ). As an excellent source of fiber and nutrients like vitamin C, calcium, folate, and iron, they aid in managing blood sugar and cholesterol levels — and may even reduce the risk of some cancers ( 14 , 15 ). The three-mix adds non-starchy vegetables like spinach or tomatoes to the two-mix principle. All four of the foundational food groups — staples, legumes, vegetables, and animal foods — are represented in a four-mix meal: Four-mixes are common for Sunday lunches — traditional, large family-style meals on Sunday afternoons — and in one-pot dishes like pelau. Pelau is a one-pot dish made with caramelized chicken, rice, pigeon peas, and non-starchy vegetables like carrots and sweet peppers. Coleslaw or fresh salads may be served as accompaniments. A traditional Sunday lunch may include stewed beans, rice, macaroni pie, plantains , callaloo, oven-baked BBQ chicken, and fresh salad. Callaloo is a dish of puréed taro leaves, pumpkin, and okra made with coconut milk , herbs like green onions, garlic, and onions, and optional meats like smoked turkey bones or crab. Another example of a four-mix meal is cornmeal dumplings served with stewed lentils, steamed fish, and fresh salad. All four foundational food groups — staples, legumes, animal foods, and vegetables — are represented in a four-mix meal, commonly seen in one-pot dishes like pelau or for traditional Sunday lunches. The other Caribbean food groups — fruits, plus fats and oils — aren’t considered foundational groups in the multi-mix tool. Still, you’re encouraged to eat them throughout the day — at least two servings of fruit and three servings of fats per day ( 5 ). The fats and oils group consists of coconut oil, coconut milk, peanut butter, avocado, and all cooking oils. Although these foods are high in calories, their fats play important roles in body temperature regulation and absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K ( 16 ). Though the multi-mix concept doesn’t include these foods, fats and oils are usually represented at most meals because traditional Caribbean dishes are prepared using oils, butter, or margarine or are accompanied by high fat foods like avocado. Also called “zaboca” in the Caribbean, avocado is rich in monounsaturated fats, which may lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and help reduce your risk of heart disease ( 17 , 18 ). The fruits group includes fresh, frozen, dried, and canned Caribbean fruits. Low fruit intake is associated with an increased risk of gut health issues like constipation, as well as chronic diseases like certain cancers ( 9 , 19 ). Local and seasonal fruits include five-finger (carambola), pommecythere, mango, silk fig (a variety of banana), oranges, Portugal fruit, and guava . These fruits are no less nutritious than imported varieties. For instance, the West Indian cherry, also called acerola , packs 22 times more vitamin C per 1 cup (98 grams) of fruit than kiwi ( 20 , 21 ). Enjoy fruits as snacks between meals, raw, or in chows — a dish made from half-ripe fruit seasoned with black pepper, salt, and spicy peppers like pimento or habanero. Neither fruits nor fats and oils are foundational food groups in the multi-mix concept but should still make up a portion of your daily food intake. Diet-related chronic diseases are on the rise in the Caribbean and its diaspora, yet this region’s cultural foods are often poorly represented in mainstream nutrition education. The multi-mix principle uses four of the six Caribbean food groups — staples, legumes, animal foods, and vegetables — to build practical, nutritionally balanced meals. You can use this concept as a meal planning tool. The remaining food groups — fruits , plus fats and oils — aren’t considered foundational but should still be eaten throughout the day. Aim for at least two fruit servings and three fat servings each day.

Deficiencies in certain vitamins, including vitamin C, zinc, and others, may weaken your immune system. Taking supplements of these vitamins may help support immune system function. No supplement will cure or prevent disease. With the 2019 COVID-19 pandemic, it’s especially important to understand that no supplement or diet can protect against COVID-19. Physical distancing, also known as social distancing, and proper hygiene practices may help protect you from COVID-19. Your immune system consists of a complex collection of cells, processes, and chemicals that defend your body against invading pathogens, including viruses, toxins, and bacteria. Keeping your immune system healthy is key to preventing infection and disease. Some research suggests supplementing with certain vitamins, minerals, and herbs may help boost your immune system. However, it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before trying a new supplement, as some supplements may interact with medications. Here are 15 supplements that are known for their immune-boosting potential. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient essential to the health and functioning of your immune system. Vitamin D enhances the pathogen-fighting effects of monocytes and macrophages — white blood cells that are important parts of your immune defense — and decreases inflammation, which helps promote immune response. Many people are deficient in this important vitamin , which may negatively affect immune function. Vitamin D deficiency may be associated with an increased risk of several conditions, such as : Research suggests that supplementing with vitamin D may help improve immune response. For example, a 2019 review found that supplementing with vitamin D significantly decreased the risk of respiratory infections in people deficient in this vitamin and lowered infection risk in those with adequate vitamin D levels. Vitamin D has also been researched in connection with COVID-19 because of its effect on the immune system. It may help expedite healing and stall inflammation in the respiratory system. However, more research is needed to fully support its effects in the treatment of COVID-19. The recommended daily intake of vitamin D is 15 micrograms (600 IU) for adults. However, it’s best to speak with a healthcare professional. They could help determine the best amount for you. Zinc is a mineral commonly added to supplements and other healthcare products. It’s essential for immune system function because it helps: Zinc deficiency may affect your immune system’s ability to function properly, resulting in an increased risk of infection and disease, including pneumonia. Zinc deficiency affects around 2 billion people worldwide and up to 30% of older adults. Research suggests that zinc supplements may be beneficial for people who are already sick. For example, it could help reduce the duration of the common cold. Taking zinc long-term is typically safe for healthy adults, as long as the daily dose is under the set upper limit of 40 milligrams (mg) of elemental zinc per day. Excessive doses may interfere with copper and iron absorption, which could increase your infection risk. Vitamin C is perhaps the most popular supplement for protecting against infection due to its important role in immune health. This vitamin supports the function of various immune cells and enhances their ability to protect against infection. It may also help: Additionally, high dose intravenous vitamin C treatment may help improve symptoms in people with severe infections, including sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) resulting from viral infections. That said, more research is needed to fully support the role of vitamin C supplementation in this setting. The upper limit for vitamin C is 2,000 mg . Supplemental daily doses are typically between 250 and 1,000 mg. Black elderberry (Sambucus nigra), which has long been used to treat infections, is being researched for its effects on immune health. Animal studies suggest elderberry extract may have antiviral potential against pathogens responsible for upper respiratory tract infections and strains of the influenza virus. A 2018 review found that elderberry supplements may help reduce upper respiratory symptoms caused by viral infections. Similarly, a 2021 review noted that elderberry may help reduce the duration and severity of colds. Some people recommend using elderberry supplements only in the early stages of COVID-19. However, no research has evaluated the use of elderberry for COVID-19. Raw elderberries should be cooked before consumption. This helps destroy sambunigrin, a compound found in elderberries that may cause cyanide poisoning. Speak with a healthcare professional before taking elderberry supplements. Elderberry supplements are most often sold in liquid or capsule form. Medicinal mushrooms have been used since ancient times to help prevent and treat infection and disease. Research suggests that many types of medicinal mushrooms may help boost the immune system. For example, a 2017 study in mice with tuberculosis found that treatment with cordyceps helped reduce bacterial load in the lungs, enhance immune response, and reduce inflammation. Similarly, a 2019 study in 79 adults found that supplementing with 1.7 grams (g) of cordyceps mycelium culture extract led to a 38% increase in the activity of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of white blood cell that protects against infection. Turkey tail is another medicinal mushroom that may enhance immune response, especially in people with certain types of cancer. Medicinal mushroom products can be found in the form of tinctures, teas, and supplements. A wide range of other supplements may help improve your immune system. However, it’s important to note that more research is needed to support their full effects. Speak with a healthcare professional before taking any new supplements. Astragalus is an herb commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Animal research suggests its extract may significantly improve immune-related responses. Selenium is an essential mineral for immune health. Animal research demonstrates that selenium supplements may enhance antiviral defense against influenza strains, including H1N1 and H9N2 . Garlic has powerful anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and immunomodulating properties. Research suggests it may help enhance immune health by stimulating and enhancing certain cytokines. This herb contains andrographolide, a terpenoid compound that may have antiviral effects against several respiratory disease-causing viruses. It works by stimulating different types of cells, such as cytokine T cells and natural killer cells. Licorice contains many substances, including glycyrrhizin, that may help protect against viral infections. Research suggests glycyrrhizin has several anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and immune-boosting properties that could help protect against several illnesses, such as: Some human research supports the use of this African geranium extract to help alleviate symptoms of acute viral respiratory infections, including the common cold and bronchitis. Still, results are mixed, and more research is needed. B vitamins, including B12 and B6, are important for a healthy immune response. Yet, many adults are deficient in them, which may negatively affect immune health. Curcumin is the main active compound in turmeric. It has powerful anti-inflammatory properties, and animal studies indicate that it may help improve immune function. Echinacea is a genus of plants in the daisy family. Certain species have been shown to improve immune health and may protect against upper respiratory tract infections, though research is mixed. Propolis is a resin-like material honeybees produce for use as a sealant in hives. Though it has impressive immune-enhancing effects and may have antiviral properties as well, more human research is needed. There’s no single, most powerful immune system booster. However, some foods, including bell peppers, fish, almonds, and citrus fruits, provide nutrients that may help strengthen your immune system. Beverages, such as green tea, that contain antioxidants may help boost the immune system. But more research is needed. Research suggests that some supplements — like vitamin D, medicinal mushrooms, and elderberry — may help boost the immune system. However, more research is needed, and it’s important to speak with a healthcare professional before trying a new supplement. Many supplements on the market may help improve immune health , such as zinc, elderberry, and vitamins C and D, among others. Although these supplements may offer a small benefit for immune health, they can’t be used to replace a healthy diet and lifestyle. If you decide you want to try a supplement, speak with a healthcare professional first, as some supplements may interact with certain medications or are inappropriate for some people.

If you’re ever hungry and find yourself in Orange County, California, you might want to make your way to 17-year-old Tabay Atkin’s gas station food truck. It may look like your typical roadside eatery from the outside, but there’s a lot more going on at Tabay’s Mindful Kitchen than meets the eye. For starters, the burgers, tacos, wraps, and nuggets on offer all have one thing in common: They’re 100 percent plant-based. Atkins doesn’t advertise his offerings as vegan, but everything you order from the menu just so happens to be meat, dairy, and animal product-free. While it may not be what you expect from a roadside dining experience, Atkins has plenty of happy customers who appreciate the taste and the benefits of his vegan fare. Atkins was only 12 years old when he decided he wanted to become vegan. However, the story starts when he was even younger. Atkins’ mother, Sahel, had recently fought a battle with cancer. She went through intensive chemotherapy with debilitating side effects and joined a yoga teacher training program when she was just two weeks cancer-free. At just six years old, her son was by her side every step of the way. As Atkins watched his mother grow stronger and more resilient as she practiced, he knew that yoga was his calling. “I got into yoga after my mom beat cancer,” says Atkins. “After practicing Yoga, she was able to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and cancer, and that inspired me to start teaching yoga.” Since then, Tabay has completed a number of yoga teacher trainings, healing certifications, and specialty modalities. After being immersed in the yoga community at six years old, it was a logical step to Tabay when he finally went vegan six years later. “If yoga is a big part of your life, you’re going to start hearing about veganism, whether you like it or not,” Atkins shares. Atkins and his mother explored veganism, encouraged by their newfound community and commitment to health. What finally prompted them to make the switch turned out to be a an airplane dinner. “We were in New York flying back to California on the airplane,” says Atkins. “I had a chicken pasta and a cheese platter, and after eating that I felt like there was a rock in my stomach. I felt really sick. I said, ‘okay, that’s enough. I’m going vegan now.’” Back at home, Atkins and his mom watched the documentary “ What the Health ,” which helped cement their decision. From there, Atkins did more research and eventually opted for a whole food, plant-based diet (WFPB). “You still don’t eat animal products,” Atkins says. “You don’t eat meat, dairy, and eggs, but you also take out processed sugar and refined oils, so you don’t have any processed foods of any kind.” While Atkins prefers the WFPB lifestyle, he still offers other options at his food truck. “Some people don’t even know what vegan is, or they have a wrong idea of what the plant-based diet is,” says Atkins. “I wanted to offer people the first step of the plant-based diet, but I also have lots of whole food plant-based options on the menu. That way people have options.” He likes to call his food truck offerings “undercover” vegan. Rather than being labeled as plant-based, the menu features items like “f’sh tacos,” “buffalo chik’n wrap,” and “beaf burger.” “It doesn’t look like a vegan food truck,” Atkins says. “I tell them it was vegan, and they had no idea. And it kind of opens people’s minds to the plant-based diet.” When it comes to the business, Atkins says the idea was on the table for him and his mom for a long time. They saved up to eventually make their food truck vision a reality. “We always knew that we wanted to eventually have our own eatery,” he says. “We got very close to buying a restaurant in probably 2013 or 14, but it all worked out for the best when we moved back to California and eventually we built a truck.” The 36-foot custom-designed truck lives at a Dana Point gas station Atkins and his mother run together. “This is something that we really wanted to do,” he says. “I’ve been in the food world for a while. Teaching cooking classes, making cooking content, and even doing small private events, but nothing of this scale. So it’s very exciting for us.” As Atkins learned more and more about the vegan lifestyle, he began to make connections with his yoga training. “I started learning even more about how much better the plant-based diet is in relation to animal rights and the non-harming of animals,” he says. Atkins notes that the yogic philosophy of “ahimsa,” or non-violence to all living beings, played a major role in his decision-making. “I started learning more about the animals and became more of an advocate for stopping animal cruelty,” he says. “I thought, ‘Wow, this is good for not just my health. It’s also good for the animals, and also the environment. It helps reduce carbon emissions. It helps reduce deforestation and water use.’” It turns out that Atkins did his research. According to a 2016 review of 63 studies, switching from a typical Western diet of mass-produced animal products to a plant-based diet focused on local ingredients could result in a 70 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and land use and 50 percent less water use. When it comes to human health, a whole foods, plant-based diet offers plenty of benefits too. These may include: A 2017 study of over 200,000 people found that those who followed a plant-based diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, and nuts and avoided processed, sugary foods had a significantly lower risk of developing heart disease than those on non-plant-based diets. A 2013 study of more than 63,000 people found an association between a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet and a significantly lower risk of gastrointestinal cancer. Another 2015 study of 77,000 people found that vegetarian diets resulted in 22 percent lower risk of developing colorectal cancer than non-vegetarian diets. If you want to try a plant-based diet for yourself, Atkins has plenty of helpful tips. First off, he suggests reducing the overwhelm and taking it one step at a time. “The best way to describe moving to a plant-based diet is: It’s a journey,” says Atkins. “It’s not you do it. And then you’re there.” Instead of jumping in all at once, ease yourself into changes one at a time. He also suggests getting comfortable with cooking at home. This can reduce the expense of dining out and purchasing specialty vegetarian items at the store, which are often processed. If you’re looking for local places to get vegan fare, Tabay suggests the Happy Cow app. Just plug in your zip code or city, and the app displays vegan options near you. When it comes to keeping things sweet on a WFPB diet, Atkins has two favorite sweeteners he uses in place of sugar: dates and jaggery. Dates , the fruit of the palm tree, are high in fiber and antioxidants, making them a great sugar swap. To sub dates for sugar, follow these simple steps: Atkins’ other favorite is jaggery , a sweetener found frequently in Asian and African dishes. Jaggery is made from sugar cane or dates but isn’t spun during processing. This leaves more nutrients behind. Jaggery may contain significant amounts of: However, it’s important to keep in mind that jaggery is still sugar. It makes a good replacement for the added nutrients, but it doesn’t reduce the calories, fructose, or sucrose that regular sugar involves. Ultimately, Atkins’ commitment to sharing plant-based eating with the world is a reflection of the intention he shares at the end of every yoga class: “Think good thoughts, speak kind words, feel love, be love, and give love.” Crystal Hoshaw is a mother, writer, and longtime yoga practitioner.

Over the years, carbohydrates have gotten a bad reputation. People often associate them with weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and a variety of other health conditions. Yes, it’s true that processed foods high in sugar and refined grains typically lack important vitamins and minerals. However, many nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods can actually be very good for you. While low carb diets can be beneficial for some people, there’s no reason to avoid high carb foods altogether. Here are 12 high carb foods that are incredibly healthy. Quinoa is a nutritious seed that has become incredibly popular among health-conscious consumers. It’s classified as a pseudocereal, which is a seed that’s prepared and eaten like a grain. Cooked quinoa contains 70% carbs, making it a high carb food. However, it’s also a good source of protein and fiber ( 1 ). Quinoa is rich in many minerals and plant compounds and has been linked to a variety of health benefits, including improved blood sugar management and heart health ( 2 , 3 ). Additionally, it does not contain any gluten, which makes it a popular alternative to wheat for those on a gluten-free diet . Quinoa is also very filling since it’s relatively high in fiber and protein. For this reason, it may help promote healthy weight management and gut health ( 4 , 5 ). Quinoa is highly nutritious and may help improve blood sugar management and support heart health. Quinoa is also high in protein and fiber, so it may be useful for weight loss, as both of these nutrients can help keep you feeling full for longer. Oats are an incredibly healthy whole grain and a great source of many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Raw oats contain 70% carbs. A 1-cup (81-gram) serving contains 54 grams of carbs, including 8 grams of fiber. They are particularly high in a specific type of fiber called oat beta glucan ( 6 , 7 ). Oats are also a relatively good source of protein and contain more protein than most grains ( 8 ). Research suggests that eating oats may reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering your cholesterol levels ( 9 , 10 , 11 ). Eating oats may also lower blood sugar levels, especially in people with type 2 diabetes ( 12 ). Furthermore, oats are very filling, which could help support healthy weight management ( 13 , 14 ). Oats contain many beneficial nutrients, including fiber and protein. Studies have also shown that eating oats lowers blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Like quinoa, buckwheat is considered a pseudocereal. Despite its name, buckwheat is not related to wheat and does not contain gluten. Raw buckwheat contains 75 grams of carbs, while cooked buckwheat groats contain about 19.9 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving ( 15 , 16 ). Buckwheat is very nutritious, containing both protein and fiber. It also has more minerals and antioxidants than many other grains ( 17 ). Additionally, studies in humans and animals suggest that it may be particularly beneficial for heart health and blood sugar regulation ( 18 , 19 ). Buckwheat is highly nutritious and contains more antioxidants and minerals than many grains. Buckwheat isn’t related to wheat and doesn’t contain gluten. Eating it may benefit your heart health and blood sugar regulation. Bananas are a popular fruit people love to use in many different recipes. One large banana (136 grams) contains about 31 grams of carbs, either in the form of starches or sugars ( 20 ). Bananas are also high in potassium and vitamins B6 and C, and they contain several beneficial plant compounds ( 20 ). Thanks to their high content of potassium, bananas may help lower blood pressure and improve heart health ( 21 ). Unripe, green bananas are higher in starch. This transforms into natural sugars as the bananas ripen, turning yellow in the process. Thus, you’ll tend to get more starch and less sugar if you eat your bananas when they’re less ripe ( 22 ). Unripe and less ripe bananas also contain decent amounts of resistant starch and pectin, both of which support digestive health and provide fuel for the beneficial bacteria in your gut ( 23 , 24 ). Bananas are high in potassium, a mineral that plays a key role in regulating blood pressure. Less ripe bananas also contain resistant starch and pectin, both of which can improve digestive health. Sweet potatoes are a delicious, nutritious tuber or root vegetable. One-half cup (100 grams) of mashed, cooked sweet potatoes with their skin on contains about 20.7 grams of carbs, which consists of starch, sugar, and fiber ( 25 ). Sweet potatoes are also a rich source of vitamin A, vitamin C, and potassium ( 25 ). What’s more, they’re packed with antioxidants, which are compounds that help neutralize harmful free radicals in your cells to protect you against chronic disease ( 26 , 27 ). Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of vitamin A, along with several other vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Beets are a purple root vegetable that people sometimes refer to as beetroots. While they aren’t considered high in carbs overall, they do have a lot for a non-starchy vegetable. Raw and cooked beets contain about 10 grams of carbs per 100 grams, mainly from sugar and fiber ( 28 , 29 ). They’re also packed with vitamins and minerals, along with powerful antioxidants and plant compounds ( 30 ). Beets are also high in inorganic nitrates, which are converted into nitric oxide in your body. Nitric oxide lowers blood pressure and may decrease the risk of several diseases ( 31 , 32 ). Beet juice is also very high in nitrates, and athletes sometimes use it to enhance their physical performance ( 33 , 34 , 35 ). That’s because nitric oxide relaxes your blood vessels, allowing oxygen to flow more efficiently during exercise. Beets are loaded with vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds. They also contain high amounts of inorganic nitrates, which can improve heart health and boost physical performance. Oranges are a popular type of citrus fruit. They’re mainly composed of water and made up of about 15.5 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving. Oranges are also a good source of fiber ( 36 ). Oranges are especially rich in vitamin C , potassium, and some B vitamins. In addition, they contain citric acid, as well as several potent plant compounds and antioxidants ( 37 ). Eating oranges may improve heart health and help prevent kidney stones. They may also increase the absorption of iron from other foods you eat, which may help protect against iron deficiency anemia ( 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 ). Oranges are a good source of fiber. They also contain high amounts of vitamin C and other healthy plant compounds. Eating oranges may benefit heart health and increase iron absorption to help prevent anemia. Blueberries are frequently marketed as a superfood due to their rich content of antioxidants. They consist mostly of water, as well as about 14.5 grams of carbs per 100 grams ( 42 ). Blueberries also contain high amounts of many vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C, vitamin K, and manganese ( 42 ). Studies have shown that blueberries are a good source of antioxidant compounds, which can help protect your body against damaging free radicals. Studies suggest that eating blueberries may even improve memory in older adults ( 43 , 44 ). Blueberries are very healthy. They contain many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, and they can help protect against oxidative damage. Grapefruit is a citrus fruit with a sweet, sour, and bitter flavor. It contains about 8% carbs and is rich in a variety of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants ( 45 ). According to some human and animal studies, grapefruit could enhance heart health and improve blood sugar management ( 46 , 47 ). Furthermore, other research suggests that certain compounds found in grapefruit could help prevent kidney stones, lower cholesterol levels, and even potentially slow the growth and spread of cancer cells ( 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 ). However, scientists need to do more studies on the effects of grapefruit in humans. Grapefruit contains many beneficial vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It may provide numerous health benefits. Apples are well known for their sweet, tart flavor and crisp texture. They’re available in many colors, sizes, and flavors, all of which generally contain about 14–16 grams of carbs per 100 grams ( 52 , 53 , 54 ). Apples also boast many vitamins and minerals, but usually only in small amounts. However, they are a good source of vitamin C, antioxidants, and fiber ( 55 ). Apples may also offer several health benefits, including improved blood sugar management and heart health ( 56 , 57 ). Early research suggests that adding apples to your diet may even be associated with a reduced risk of certain types of cancer. However, more research is needed ( 58 , 59 ). Apples contain a decent amount of vitamin C, antioxidants, and plant compounds. Eating apples may improve blood sugar management, as well as reduce the risk of heart disease and potentially even certain types of cancer. Kidney beans are a member of the legume family and a variety of the common bean. Cooked kidney beans contain about 21.5 grams of carbs per 100 grams, in the form of starches and fiber. This legume is also high in protein ( 62 ). Kidney beans are a good source of many vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds. They’re also rich in antioxidant compounds, including anthocyanins and isoflavones ( 63 ). Their numerous health benefits include improved blood sugar regulation and a reduced risk of colon cancer ( 64 , 65 ). Kidney beans contain many vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Cooked kidney beans are also a good source of protein and have been linked to several health benefits. Also known as garbanzo beans, chickpeas are part of the legume family. Cooked chickpeas contain 27.4 grams of carbs per 100-gram serving, along with almost 8 grams of fiber. They’re also a good source of plant-based protein ( 66 ). Chickpeas contain many vitamins and minerals, including iron, phosphorus, and B vitamins ( 66 ). Not only have chickpeas been linked to improved heart and digestive health, but some test-tube studies suggest they may also help protect against certain types of cancer. More research in humans is needed, however ( 67 ). Chickpeas are an excellent source of plant-based protein and contain many vitamins and minerals. Eating chickpeas has been linked to benefits for heart and digestive health, as well as potential cancer prevention. It’s a myth that all carbs are unhealthy. In fact, many of the healthiest foods are high in carbohydrates. That said, you shouldn’t eat carbs in large amounts if you’re on a low carb diet. In addition, refined carbs, such as white bread and pasta, may be unhealthy in high amounts. However, you can enjoy these nutritious, delicious carbs as part of a healthy, whole-foods diet . Try this today: When you go grocery shopping, opt for whole grain varieties of high carb foods like bread, pasta, and rice. This will boost your intake of important nutrients, including fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

This article explains how diet may affect vestibular migraine and provides a guide for dietary changes to help reduce symptoms. Vestibular migraine is a type of migraine condition with vertigo as a main symptom. People who experience vertigo feel that they’re moving when they aren’t, or that their surroundings are moving around them when they aren’t. Vertigo can feel similar to motion sickness. A vestibular migraine episode lasts anywhere from a few seconds to several hours. Its symptoms may include a loss of balance, motion sickness, dizziness, lightheadedness, disorientation or confusion, nausea and vomiting, and a severe headache ( 1 ). While migraine attacks often involve recurrent, throbbing headaches, vestibular migraine episodes don’t always include headache symptoms — making this condition difficult to diagnose ( 2 ). Notably, some research suggests that lifestyle and dietary changes may help reduce the frequency and severity of vestibular migraine attacks ( 2 ). If you have migraines, then you can experience episodes due to your migraine triggers, such as certain foods, scents, or stress. Your migraine triggers would induce your typical migraine symptoms, not a different type of migraine. So, if you tend to have vestibular migraines, your triggers would lead to a vestibular migraine episode. The exact cause of vestibular migraine remains unknown. However, this condition seems more common among women. Genetics, diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors may also play a role ( 2 , 3 ). Research suggests that avoiding dietary triggers may reduce the occurrence and intensity of migraine attacks, including vestibular migraine ( 3 ). Common dietary triggers for migraine attacks include chocolate, alcohol, coffee , aged cheeses, and processed meats. These foods contain chemicals like tyramine, nitrates , histamine, and phenylethylamine, all of which have been linked to migraine symptoms ( 3 , 4 ). Some people report that their migraine symptoms worsen if they don’t eat, which suggests that fasting and skipping meals may trigger an attack. And even mild dehydration, which can happen if you forget to drink water, can trigger a migraine episode ( 5 ). Keep in mind that trigger foods may vary from person to person. In fact, some people may find that their diet doesn’t affect migraine episodes. Certain foods, such as alcohol, processed meats, and chocolate, may trigger a vestibular migraine. Fasting and skipping meals may also play a role. Remember that dietary triggers may vary from person to person. Currently, there are no official dietary guidelines for vestibular migraines. Consider whether certain foods, such as the foods that are known to be migraine triggers, have been associated with your migraines. You can start by eliminating that specific food to see whether that affects your migraine frequency. If you can’t identify a dietary trigger, an elimination diet might be an approach you can take ( 3 , 6 ). With this approach, you remove foods you suspect may worsen your symptoms. Because people respond differently to foods, elimination diets are personalized for each individual ( 3 ). You then reintroduce these foods at a later date, group by group, to determine whether any food or food group triggers your symptoms. An elimination diet typically lasts 5–6 weeks. It should only be done under the supervision of a health professional like a dietitian or doctor, as it increases your risk of a nutritional deficiency if followed incorrectly or for too long. Bear in mind that vestibular migraine is a complex condition, and you may find that dietary changes don’t affect your symptoms. An elimination diet is divided into two main phases — elimination and reintroduction. During this phase, you avoid foods that may trigger vestibular migraine symptoms. You can then tell whether diet plays a role in your symptoms because you’ve eliminated nearly all possible trigger foods. This phase typically lasts 2–3 weeks. During this phase, you slowly reintroduce the eliminated foods or food groups. Each food group should be introduced individually over 2–3 days while you record how it affects your vestibular migraine symptoms. If you find that reintroducing a food or food group doesn’t worsen your attacks, it’s likely safe to eat. Yet, a food that triggers symptoms may need to be cut from your diet indefinitely. The reintroduction phase takes another 2–3 weeks depending on how many food groups you eliminated initially, though it may last longer if your health care professional recommends it. An elimination diet targeting migraine trigger foods may help reduce vestibular migraine symptoms. This diet has two main phases — elimination and reintroduction — and usually lasts 5–6 weeks. An elimination diet for vestibular migraine should remove foods linked to migraine symptoms, such as ( 4 ): Caffeine intake has a major impact on migraines. If you regularly drink caffeinated beverages, you might get a migraine just by reducing or increasing the amount. So you should not make changes in your caffeine intake while you are trying an elimination diet. Other foods that may worsen symptoms but have less supporting evidence include ( 4 ): If you suspect that other foods not listed above may trigger your vestibular migraine symptoms, you should consult a health care professional and consider removing them as well. Discuss which foods you should eliminate with your doctor, as well as the duration of each phase, before you start any elimination diet. Keep in mind that these food groups should only be avoided during the elimination phase, as they’re reintroduced later on. An elimination diet for vestibular migraine can help identify what foods trigger symptoms. During the elimination phase, you’re still able to enjoy plenty of healthy, delicious foods, such as ( 4 ): If you’re struggling to stay motivated during this phase, try experimenting with a variety of herbs and spices to flavor your dishes. An elimination diet doesn’t eliminate most of the healthy foods your body needs to maintain adequate nutrition. While an elimination diet may help reduce vestibular migraine symptoms, it has several potential downsides. It can be tricky to adjust to an elimination diet. You shouldn’t follow it for an extended period without the supervision of a health professional, such as a doctor or dietitian. Restricting multiple food groups for too long increases your risk of nutrient deficiencies . Furthermore, it’s important to note that eliminating trigger foods may not work for everyone, as diet may not play a role in everyone’s vestibular migraine attacks. What triggers one person’s symptoms may not trigger another’s. If you don’t seek professional guidance, a vestibular migraine diet may increase your risk of nutrient deficiencies. In some cases, this diet may not help treat your symptoms. Vestibular migraine attacks, which are characterized by vertigo, can be extremely uncomfortable, though removing trigger foods may relieve symptoms. The most common dietary triggers include aged cheeses, processed meats, chocolate, coffee, MSG, and alcoholic beverages like red wine and beer . Fasting or skipping meals may likewise play a role. Some research suggests that an elimination diet may help identify specific triggers. You should only follow an elimination diet under the supervision of a health professional. Remember that diet may not play a role in everyone’s migraine symptoms.  Share this article This article is based on scientific evidence, written by experts and fact checked by experts.

As a dietitian, I’ve been treating people with autoimmune conditions, including Hashimoto’s disease, for years. Hashimoto’s is the most common type of hypothyroidism in the United States. It’s an autoimmune disease that damages the thyroid, a gland that releases hormones that control metabolism, growth, and a number of other bodily functions. Through my patients, I knew how difficult Hashimoto’s disease could be to diagnose, treat, and manage. However, I had no idea just how much this disease affects physical and mental health until I was diagnosed myself. Here’s my story. I started to feel off in the summer of 2019. I couldn’t sleep, was so tired during the day that I could barely finish my work, and felt hungover every morning even though I wasn’t drinking alcohol at the time. I was also experiencing strange heart flutters, anxiety , brain fog, difficulty concentrating, extreme cold intolerance, joint pain , air hunger (a feeling of shortness of breath), and many other vague symptoms. Over the next several months, I visited a number of specialists, including a cardiologist, pulmonologist, and rheumatologist. Every test came back normal aside from my white blood cell count, which was low. I was also slightly anemic . Some people with Hashimoto’s disease have normal or only borderline low thyroid values in lab results. That’s because the thyroid destruction that happens during Hashimoto’s disease is intermittent. Some of the doctors I saw were dismissive and chalked my symptoms up to stress and anxiety, which — by the way — is extremely common for people with Hashimoto’s. After hearing several doctors tell me that everything was normal, I thought I was losing my mind. I started to question myself. Were these symptoms seriously caused by stress and anxiety? No. I knew my body, and I knew that something was wrong. As a last ditch effort, I made an appointment with an infectious disease doctor because I live on the East End of Long Island, where ticks are abundant. I thought my symptoms could be due to Lyme disease. This doctor ran bloodwork, including a thyroid panel . As a dietitian, I like to review my own results as soon as they’re available. When I saw that my T3 was low, I called an endocrinologist with whom I work closely and made an appointment. She was the one who finally diagnosed me with Hashimoto’s disease after an ultrasound of my thyroid and bloodwork that showed low levels of T3, a thyroid hormone, and elevated thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies. Getting a diagnosis took me about 7 months, which is very common for people with Hashimoto’s disease. I was so relieved to get a diagnosis after months of being told that my symptoms were basically all in my head. But I was also worried about my health and resentful about the diagnosis. Aside from having Raynaud’s syndrome , which reduces blood flow to the fingers and toes, and exercise-induced asthma as a kid, I was a healthy person with limitless energy. I took very good care of my health, exercised, didn’t smoke, and grew my own food. However, I knew far too well that autoimmune conditions, as well as serious medical conditions in general, can affect anyone — even people who are physically healthy. My endocrinologist thinks that, in my case, a viral infection triggered my Hashimoto’s disease. She started me on Armour Thyroid, a natural thyroid hormone replacement medication. Although researchers are still unsure about the exact cause of Hashimoto’s, multiple factors, including genetic vulnerability and environmental triggers, are thought to be involved. After starting on Armour, I thought I would start feeling better within a few weeks. Yet, although some of my symptoms like severe cold intolerance and joint pain improved, I was still feeling awful after about a month or so on the same dose. Symptoms persisting even with medication is also prevalent among those with Hashimoto’s. Although some people respond well to medication and start feeling like their old selves, others continue experiencing significant symptoms that affect their quality of life even when their thyroid function is considered normal. In fact, many endocrinologists and researchers recognize that symptoms alone aren’t usually used to assess the effectiveness of treatment — laboratory values are. Therefore, medications are prescribed and adjusted based on these values, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Thankfully, my doctor expressed interest in how I was feeling and whether my symptoms were being controlled. She was always open to trying new medications and doses until we found a treatment that made me feel better. When I told her that I was still experiencing significant symptoms, she increased my dosage. After another few weeks, I finally started to feel better and get my energy back. After starting the initial dose of medication, I also tried dietary and supplement protocols that I had previously encouraged my patients with Hashimoto’s disease to implement. These regimens had worked wonders for some of them — but not all. Like anything else I recommend to my patients, these supplements and protocols are based on scientific research. It’s important to work with a dietitian when making changes to your diet or supplement protocol. It’s just as necessary to let your healthcare provider know if you start taking supplements. I first tried the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet, which was shown to improve quality of life and significantly reduce markers of inflammation in people with Hashimoto’s in a 2019 research study . I followed the protocol strictly, but it didn’t significantly improve my symptoms. To be honest, I already ate plant-centric, paleo-style meals for many years before I was diagnosed. Not only did this eating pattern help manage my Raynaud’s syndrome symptoms, but it also made me feel my best. Although I added back certain grains, some cheeses, and legumes, which are eliminated in AIP, I continued to avoid gluten and returned to my normal diet, which consists of plenty of veggies, fruits, healthy fats, and protein sources like fish, eggs, and chicken. As a gluten-free diet has been shown to improve thyroid function and reduce thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s, I suggest that all of my patients with Hashimoto’s try this diet for at least a few months to see if their symptoms and disease markers improve. For supplements, I again turned to research to find the most evidence-based approach. Since I had been treating people with Hashimoto’s, I knew that anti-inflammatory supplements like fish oil and certain nutrients like zinc , selenium, and magnesium may be helpful. I also knew that people with Hashimoto’s are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients like vitamins B12 and D. I was already taking a vitamin D/K2 supplement, B complex vitamin, and magnesium glycinate, so I added in selenium , zinc, and high dose fish oil. Like the dietary changes, these supplements didn’t make me feel significantly better. However, certain beneficial changes can’t be determined solely by how you feel. In general, taking certain supplements and following an anti-inflammatory, nutrient-dense diet may improve thyroid function, inflammation, and overall health. Being treated with medication, taking certain supplements, and adhering to a nutrient-dense diet did help me feel better over time. Remember that managing an autoimmune disease is a marathon, not a sprint. Explore more dietary and supplement tips for Hashimoto’s disease in my comprehensive, science-based article here . Finding the right medication and dosage, following a nutritious diet, and taking supplements have significantly improved my quality of life. Plus, giving my body time to recover was key. When I was first diagnosed, I didn’t have the energy to exercise or do my favorite hobbies like hiking and gardening, so I let myself rest. A lot of guilt and frustration accompanies feeling too unwell to do things that you love, being unable to exercise, and struggling to fully engage in life, which can take a toll on your relationships with friends and family. I felt lazy and like I needed to push myself to do things. However, I quickly realized that letting myself rest when I needed to and showing myself compassion was much more important for my health. I took it easy until I started to feel better. Although I’m mostly back to my normal energy levels and don’t experience significant symptoms that often, I still have off days when I know I need to let myself rest, and that’s OK. I know what makes me feel worse — drinking alcohol, not getting enough sleep, and being overly stimulated or stressed. This is also true for many of my patients who have Hashimoto’s. And here’s what makes me and most of my patients feel better: Generally, following a nutritious, anti-inflammatory diet , reducing stress, and leading a healthy lifestyle are likely to reduce certain Hashimoto’s symptoms. However, it’s important to note that no specific diet is currently recommended to treat Hashimoto’s disease. Just because something works for one person doesn’t mean it works for others, which is one reason why self-experimentation is so important. I’m lucky that my endocrinologist is a wonderful doctor and personal friend with whom I feel comfortable asking questions and talking openly about my health. For many people, this isn’t the case. I’ve had patients who’ve been dismissed by numerous doctors, misdiagnosed, and not properly treated. Unfortunately, this is very common. In fact, up to one-third of people with hypothyroidism doesn’t receive adequate treatment. As mentioned above, it’s not uncommon for people to see multiple doctors before being diagnosed. Even after diagnosis, many people aren’t comfortable telling their doctor that their medication isn’t effective and that they’re still experiencing symptoms. It may take your doctor several attempts to get the dosing and medication right before you start feeling better. Make sure you choose a specialist with whom you feel comfortable discussing your symptoms and treatment options. You have the right to ask questions about your health, and your doctor should take your symptoms seriously. There are so many excellent doctors out there. If you’re uncomfortable with your provider, find another one. Some people find success by working only with an endocrinologist , others feel better after working with a dietitian to overhaul their diet and lifestyle, and still others prefer to see a functional medicine practitioner. Remember that you always have options. Use them. Moreover, try to work with a dietitian who specializes in hypothyroidism or autoimmune diseases if you decide to experiment with diet and supplements. These experts can help you determine the best regimen for your needs. You need to be your own health advocate. This is important for everyone with a medical condition to keep in mind. You know your body best. If you think there’s something wrong, keep digging. Don’t give up. Find a healthcare provider who’s thorough and listens to you. I know that going to numerous doctor’s appointments can be frustrating and time-consuming, as can trying various medications, dietary patterns, and supplements. Yet, I also know that these things are essential to improving your health and managing your symptoms. Lastly, remember that you’re not alone. Get help when you need it from friends, family, and healthcare providers. We’re all here to listen and support you on your path to feeling better.

When I was 26, I had a humbling moment that would change my life’s trajectory. I was writing my master’s thesis on the environmental impacts of the standard American diet when I suddenly realized that my food choices didn’t reflect my personal ethics or values. This was particularly ironic because I’m a dietitian — someone who had dedicated herself to teaching others about the importance of nutrition. Through my research, I became uncomfortably aware of social, ethical, and environmental issues that I had never considered. What stood out to me was how interconnected our everyday food choices are with all other life on the planet. For example, I learned how runoff from industrial animal farms contaminates waterways, which can affect ecosystem health and the safety of the water we drink. I also learned that we could address world hunger more effectively by feeding crops to people rather than livestock. Through my food choices, I was supporting industrial animal agriculture while calling myself an environmentalist or an animal lover. This cognitive dissonance was a perfect illustration of the disconnect between people and the food they eat. The food on my plate affected the entire world — and not in a good way. So, over several months, I transitioned from a meat-heavy Western diet to a predominantly whole-foods, plant-based eating pattern. When I had kids, I decided to raise them on a plant-based diet from the start. Here’s why my children are plant-based, and why I teach them things about food that I didn’t know until I was 26. “Plant-based” is a fairly broad term often used to describe variations of a vegetarian diet . It may mean a vegan diet that excludes all animal products, a diet made mostly of plants with small amounts of animal products like cheese or fish, or anywhere in between. Regardless, a plant-based diet generally emphasizes whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. Of course, semantics aren’t the point. What matters most is understanding the reasons why more people are adopting plant-based diets — and having conversations about those reasons. What if I told you that I’m raising my kids plant-based so that they can help create a better future for themselves and the rest of the human race? You might think I’m being dramatic, and I totally get it. Still, according to the most comprehensive analysis to date of how modern farming destroys the environment, the biggest way to reduce your carbon footprint is to stop eating meat and dairy ( 1 ). The environmental impacts of meat were also highlighted in a 2018 editorial by The Lancet, one of the most respected medical journals in the world ( 2 ). If we don’t take drastic action to treat the environment differently, we’re looking at a future of more intense climate change ( 3 ). This would likely mean less available freshwater, more extreme temperatures, more droughts and wildfires, and rising sea levels that flood coastal communities, among other global effects ( 4 ). The good news is that you and your kids can make a change today for a better future. Here’s why a plant-based diet is better for the planet. Earth’s resources are finite, yet the demand for animal products uses a lot of resources. To create enough land to graze beef cattle and grow crops like soy that are primarily used to feed animals, entire forests are razed in places like the Amazon rainforest ( 5 ). Furthermore, when you take into account the water required to raise the cow and grow food for it, some sources estimate that it takes 1,800 gallons (6,814 liters) of water to produce 1 pound (0.45 kg) of beef ( 6 ). Why does this matter? The United Nations reports that the world will only have 60% of the water we need in 2030 if we continue business as usual ( 7 ). All of the chemicals, waste, and contaminants from industrial animal farms have to go somewhere, and that often means waterways. Every waterway eventually runs into the ocean, where it has lasting effects, such as creating dead zones. Dead zones are areas where harmful algae have bloomed and deprived the ocean of oxygen, making it impossible for most aquatic life to survive. By 2008, there were at least 400 dead zones worldwide, with one of the largest — in the Gulf of Mexico — the size of the state of New Jersey ( 8 , 9 ). Scientists predict major ecosystem collapse and mass extinctions if this pattern isn’t reversed ( 10 ). It takes a delicate balance of plants, animals, and insects to keep ecosystems thriving. When we deforest the Amazon, we’re also destroying the habitats of many native species, including people. These former forests are largely replaced by herds of grazing cattle or used as farmland to grow crops, such as soy, to feed livestock ( 11 ). What’s more, many components needed to make lifesaving modern medicines have originated from plants in the rainforest, which are quickly disappearing ( 12 ). Major greenhouse gases (GHG) include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide, and methane, all of which are produced by industrial animal agriculture. When GHG are released into the atmosphere, they contribute to global warming ( 3 , 4 ). While the focus on reducing GHGs has long been on buying more fuel-efficient vehicles, livestock are responsible for approximately the same amount of emissions as all of transportation. Each sector contributes approximately 14–15% of global GHGs ( 13 , 14 , 15 ). Notably, cows produce methane, which is approximately 30 times more powerful at trapping heat in the atmosphere than CO2. Since around 60% of all mammals on Earth at any given time are farmed animals, that’s a lot of methane ( 16 , 17 ). Plus, the Amazon rainforest plays a significant role in regulating climate because its trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. When the forests are chopped and burned to make space for grazing cattle, this CO2 is rereleased into the atmosphere ( 11 , 18 , 19 ). Although a plant-based diet still requires natural resources, its environmental impacts are smaller. Plus, growing plants for human consumption results in a much larger yield. Moreover, by feeding more crops directly to people instead of livestock, we could use food resources more efficiently and better address world hunger. One study suggested that making this shift in crop usage could increase the global availability of calories by as much as 70% ( 20 ). Whatever a plant-based diet looks like for your family, the research is clear that the most sustainable way of eating is heavily focused on plants, with animal products minimized or excluded entirely ( 21 ). In addition to saving animals and helping reduce many of the current stresses on the environment, a plant-based diet can do wonders for long-term health ( 22 ). Plenty of evidence shows that eating a predominantly whole-foods, plant-based diet supports healthy weight loss, protects brain health, boosts immunity, and reduces inflammation ( 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 ). This diet may also promote digestive and reproductive health, lengthen your lifespan , and reduce your risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer ( 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 ). For my kids in particular, I love that a plant-based diet has positioned disease-fighting foods like beans, leafy greens, lentils, and seeds as a foundation of our meals instead of merely side dishes. I also love that my kids are learning to recognize these foods as the norm rather than animal-based snacks and fast foods heavily marketed to children. Plus, research suggests that since plaque buildup in the arteries starts in childhood, starting plant-based diets early on may prevent heart disease later in life. Other studies note a small but possible correlation between dairy intake in childhood and a higher risk of prostate cancer in adulthood ( 31 , 32 ). Healthy plant-based diets are also associated with a lower incidence of overweight and obesity in children ( 33 , 34 ). These are benefits that can serve kids now and for life. Despite the evidence in support of plant-based diets, critics say that it’s not safe or appropriate to exclude animal products from a child’s diet. One of the biggest arguments against plant-based diets for kids is that they don’t provide enough fat, protein, or micronutrients like calcium and iron, all of which are important for growth and development. However, highly respected professional organizations like the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics note that well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy, nutritionally adequate, and appropriate for all stages of the life cycle, including infancy and childhood ( 35 ). One study compared energy and macronutrient intake, as well as growth, in 1–3-year-old vegan, vegetarian, and omnivorous kids in Germany. The researchers found that an omnivorous diet included more protein and added sugar while a vegan diet boasted more carbs and fiber. They concluded that a plant-based diet can meet their nutritional needs and support normal growth patterns ( 36 ). While animal products are one way to get important nutrients for kids, they’re certainly not the only, or necessarily the best, ones out there. My kids enjoy a fiber-rich diet full of disease-fighting antioxidants from plants. They get fat from avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil; protein from tofu, seitan, and beans; and a wide array of vitamins and minerals from fruits and vegetables. They also enjoy dessert — it’s just made using plant ingredients. We take supplements when needed, as many people do regardless of their diet. Importantly, my kids have experienced normal growth and development with no nutritional concerns from their pediatrician or dietitian mama. Making a plant-based switch is a family affair, so make it enjoyable! Involve your kids in things like meal planning, picking out new foods to try, or even preparing dishes in the kitchen. These ideas help make it fun while focusing on nutrition and keeping things simple. When you adjust your family’s diet, keep in mind individual needs and potential obstacles. The most important thing is to identify your goals and implement changes that make the most sense for your household. Here are some tips that can make a plant-based switch with kids a little easier: My kids are young, so conversations are simple right now. They know that we don’t eat animals, but some people do and that’s OK. I talk to them about how pigs, cows, and chickens are just like our dog and deserve the same treatment. They also know that not eating animals helps keep nature beautiful so we can all continue to enjoy playing outside. What they don’t totally understand yet is that eating more plant foods now is an investment in their long-term health, as well as the health of the planet, which they can enjoy as they grow up. I understand that the idea of switching to a plant-based diet may feel overwhelming at first. I’ve been there. There are many misconceptions about plant-based diets being expensive, difficult, nutritionally inadequate, or even bland. However, with some planning and practice, they can be absolutely feasible, accessible, and enjoyable for anyone — even your kids. I won’t always make the right calls as a parent. Still, I think raising today’s kids to eat in a way that benefits their lifelong health, teaches boundless empathy, and preserves the future of the planet is something we can all get on board with. Lauren Panoff is a registered dietitian, writer, and speaker who specializes in helping families transition to plant-based lifestyles.

Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is the most common preventable risk factor for heart disease. Over 1 billion people worldwide have high blood pressure, which is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) values (the top number) of 130 mm Hg or more, diastolic blood pressure (DBP, the bottom number) of more than 80 mm Hg, or both. Lifestyle changes and dietary modifications can also help lower blood pressure levels and reduce your risk of heart disease. Doctors may also prescribe medications to reduce blood pressure levels, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Certain foods, especially those high in potassium and magnesium, may help lower blood pressure . Here are the 17 best foods for high blood pressure. Citrus fruits may help lower blood pressure. They’re loaded with vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds, that could help keep your heart healthy by reducing risk factors for heart disease like high blood pressure . Citrus fruits can include: A 2021 study reviewed the last 10 years of information on fruit and management of high blood pressure. The researchers found that eating roughly 530 to 600 grams of fruit per day (about four oranges) was beneficial for blood pressure management. Researchers have linked citrus fruits, in particular, with a lower possibility of high blood pressure. Drinking orange and grapefruit juice may help reduce blood pressure. But grapefruit and grapefruit juice can interfere with common medications for lowering blood pressure, so consult a healthcare professional before adding this fruit to your diet. Fatty fish are an excellent source of omega-3 fats , which have significant heart benefits. These fats may help reduce blood pressure levels by lowering inflammation . A 2022 study looked at 71 studies and health information from 4,973 people to determine the relationship between omega-3 fats from the diet or supplements and blood pressure. The largest benefit for lowering blood pressure occurred with a daily amount between 2 to 3 grams of omega-3 fats (about a 3.5-ounce serving of salmon). Higher omega-3 fat levels in the diet, including fish, may also lower the risk of high blood pressure in adults as young as 18 with no history of heart disease or diabetes. Swiss chard and spinach are two examples of leafy greens that may help lower blood pressure. These leafy greens are a source of nutrients such as potassium and magnesium , which support optimal blood pressure levels. For instance, 1 cup (175 grams) of cooked Swiss chard delivers 150 mg of magnesium and 961 mg of potassium. A 2022 study found that among females with high sodium levels, every 1 gram increase in daily potassium was linked with a 2.4 mm Hg lower SBP. Spinach is a leafy green high in a plant-based compound known as nitrate , which may lower blood pressure. It’s also loaded with antioxidants, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which can support heart health. An older, small study of 27 people found that those who ate 16.9 ounces (500 milliliters) of a high nitrate spinach soup daily for 7 days experienced reductions in both SBP and DBP, compared with those who consumed low nitrate asparagus soup. More recent clinical research does not show a similar effect of high-nitrate leafy greens on lowering BP, so additional studies are needed to further explore these results. Nuts and seeds may have a beneficial effect on blood pressure. Examples of nuts and seeds to eat as part of a balanced diet focused on lowering blood pressure include: Many nuts and seeds offer a concentrated source of nutrients important for blood pressure control, including fiber and arginine . Arginine is an amino acid needed to produce nitric oxide, an essential compound for blood vessel relaxation and blood pressure reduction. While some research shows a positive relationship between eating nuts or seeds and lower blood pressure, the evidence is mixed in clinical studies. Scientists believe the conflicting results could be because clinical studies involving nuts or seeds and blood pressure measurements might be too short in time to identify any potential effects on lowering blood pressure. Longer studies may help researchers better understand how nuts or seeds may lower blood pressure. Legumes are rich in nutrients that may help regulate blood pressure, such as magnesium and potassium. Research suggests legumes may help lower high blood pressure levels. Legumes include: But a 2023 review of 16 clinical studies found no relationship between eating legumes and lowered blood pressure levels. The authors suggest that additional studies that are larger and longer may help explain how legumes correlate with lower blood pressure in other studies. Berries offer impressive health benefits , including the potential to reduce heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure. Berries are a rich source of antioxidants, including anthocyanins , which are pigments that give berries their vibrant color. Anthocyanins can increase nitric oxide levels in the blood and reduce the production of molecules that restrict blood flow. This may help lower blood pressure. However, research results have been mixed, and more research in humans is needed to confirm this. Some berries that may reduce blood pressure include: A 2020 review of clinical studies found various types of berries, including whole, freeze-dried, or juice forms, reduced SBP by over 3 mm Hg. The strongest effect on SBP in this study was for cranberry juice. Eating whole grains like amaranth may help lower your blood pressure levels. Studies show that diets rich in whole grains may decrease your likelihood of high blood pressure. You could also try these other whole grains if amaranth isn’t for you: An older review of 28 studies from 2017 found that every 30-gram increase in daily whole grains eaten was linked with an 8% reduced chance of high blood pressure. Amaranth is a whole grain that’s particularly high in magnesium. One cooked cup (246 grams) provides 160 mg of magnesium . The oil from the olive tree’s fruit has numerous health benefits , including lowering blood pressure and other risk factors for heart disease. A 2020 review of studies found that due to the nutrients and plant-based compounds in olive oil, such as the omega-9 fat oleic acid and antioxidant polyphenols , it can be a beneficial part of a diet that aims to lower blood pressure. Crunchy, sweet, and nutritious carrots are a staple veggie in many people’s diets. Carrots are high in plant-based compounds that may be involved in various health processes, such as managing blood pressure. A 2023 study found that the possibility of high blood pressure went down 10% for roughly every 100 grams of carrots (about 1 cup of grated raw carrots) eaten daily. Not only are eggs nutrient-dense but research also suggests that they can be part of a balanced eating plan for blood pressure management. A 2023 study among 2,349 adults in the United States found that eating five eggs or more per week was linked with an SBP level that was 2.5 mm Hg lower than people who ate less than half an egg per week. Egg eaters also had a significantly lower likelihood of developing high blood pressure over the long term. Eating eggs also does not appear to be linked with other risk factors for heart disease beyond blood pressure, and the evidence seems to support that adults in good health may eat up to 3 eggs per day . Tomatoes and tomato products are rich in many nutrients, including potassium and the carotenoid pigment lycopene . Lycopene has been significantly linked with beneficial effects on heart health, and eating foods high in this nutrient may help reduce heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure. Research suggests consuming tomato and tomato products improves blood pressure and may help reduce your chance of heart disease and dying from heart disease. Additional studies have shown an inconsistent relationship between a diet with tomatoes and blood pressure, so more clinical studies may be needed. Broccoli is known for its many beneficial effects on health , including the health of your circulatory system. For example, adding this cruciferous veggie to your diet may be a smart way to reduce blood pressure. Broccoli is loaded with flavonoid antioxidants , which may help lower blood pressure by enhancing blood vessel function and increasing nitric oxide levels in your body. A 2024 study with 8,010 participants found a significant negative association between hypertension and total flavan-3-ol intake when total flavan-3-ol intake was below 48.26 mg/day. An older study from 2015 that included data from 187,453 people found that those who consumed four broccoli servings or more per week had a lower likelihood of high blood pressure than those who consumed broccoli once a month or less. Yogurt is a nutrient-dense dairy product packed with minerals, including potassium and calcium, that may help regulate blood pressure. A 2017 review of 28 studies found that consuming three servings of dairy per day was linked with a 13% lower possibility of high blood pressure and that a 7-ounce (200 gram) increase in the amount of dairy eaten per day was associated with a 5% reduction in risk for high blood pressure. A 2021 study also showed that among people with high blood pressure, having a serving of yogurt per day was linked with lower SBP levels. No effects were found for people with blood pressure in the typical levels. Research suggests that increasing daily yogurt consumption by one level may be linked with a 1.44 mm Hg reduction in SBP. For example, increasing the daily amount of yogurt you eat from 2 to 4 times per week to 5 to 6 times per week may benefit people with high blood pressure. Certain herbs and spices contain powerful compounds that may help reduce blood pressure by helping blood vessels relax. Some herbs and spices that may help lower blood pressure, according to older research results from studies in animals and humans, include: More recently, a 2021 study on 71 people with risk factors for heart disease found that seasoning foods with 6.6 grams (1.3 teaspoons) of 24 different herbs and spices daily was linked to lower blood pressure after 4 weeks when compared with lower dosages of herbs and spices (3.3 grams/day and 0.5 grams/day). Potatoes have several plant-based compounds that could be useful in managing blood pressure levels. A baked medium potato (173 grams) with the skin contains 926 mg of potassium . This is 20% of your daily requirement and more than a medium banana provides. A 2021 study fed 30 adults at high risk for or with high blood pressure four possible diets, including one diet with 1,000 milligrams of potassium from potatoes (boiled, baked, pan-heated), for 17 days. At the end of the study, the researchers concluded that the diet with potatoes reduced SBP as part of an overall healthy diet providing roughly 3,300 milligrams of potassium per day. Kiwifruit is exceptionally high in vitamin C and contains other nutrients involved in blood pressure regulation, including fiber, potassium, and magnesium. Kiwifruit also containes various plant-based polyphenols and antioxidant compounds. That’s why researchers believe it could help lower risk factors for heart disease, including blood pressure. A 2022 study of 43 healthy Asian adults from New Zealand found that eating two kiwis at breakfast every day for 7 weeks resulted in a 2.7 mm Hg lower SBP than the group not eating kiwifruit. Additional research with more people over longer periods of time may help confirm the role kiwi could play in helping lower blood pressure. The USDA defines “lean meat” as any meat with less than 10 grams of fat, 4.5 grams or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 100 grams (about a 3.5-ounce serving). Lean animal proteins might include any of the following meat or poultry foods that provide high quality protein and nutrients involved in blood pressure management: An older study with a small sample of older adults with elevated blood pressure found that when lean pork was substituted for chicken or fish in a modified DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet for 6 weeks, it lowered blood pressure comparable to a more traditional DASH diet. Research from scientists in China supports varying your protein sources to lower the chance of developing high blood pressure. Of eight possible protein sources, including unprocessed red meat and poultry, people with the highest variety score (four different proteins or higher) had a 66% lower chance of developing high blood pressure. Lean meats can be part of a balanced eating plan for lowering blood pressure if they meet your personal taste, budgetary, and cultural food needs. No single food can “quickly” lower blood pressure. But, having a diet rich in foods with certain nutrients (like potassium) may help lower or maintain healthy blood pressure over the long term. Experts recommend the DASH diet for people with high blood pressure or those looking to maintain optimal levels. It includes foods like fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. While drinking water won’t immediately bring down your blood pressure, staying hydrated is important to support an optimal blood pressure range. Water can help you meet your daily hydration needs . Bananas are a source of potassium , a mineral involved in maintaining blood pressure. While blood pressure can’t be lowered by eating bananas, it can count toward increasing your daily potassium intake. If you don’t like bananas, you may enjoy other foods that are high in potassium, such as kiwifruit. A diet with potassium-rich foods may help lower blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure, consider significantly limiting or avoiding foods high in sodium, added sugars, and saturated fat. You can also try swapping fattier cuts of meat for leaner options. Along with other lifestyle modifications, a healthy diet can significantly lower blood pressure levels and help reduce the risk of heart disease. If you have high blood pressure or want to maintain healthy blood pressure, adding a few foods listed in this article to your diet may help.

A dietitian is a board-certified food and nutrition expert who may provide medical nutrition therapy and counseling. Some dietitians refer to themselves as nutritionists. But, nutritionist isn’t a regulated term in every state. You may be wondering what defines true expertise in nutrition. Perhaps you have heard the terms “nutritionist” and “dietitian” and are confused by what they mean. This article reviews the differences between dietitians and nutritionists, what they do, and the education required. It focusses on definitions and regulations in the United States and addresses international ones only to a small degree. In the United States and many other countries, a dietitian is a board-certified food and nutrition expert. They are highly educated in the field of nutrition and dietetics — the science of food, nutrition, and their impact on human health. Through extensive training, dietitians acquire the expertise to provide evidence-based medical nutrition therapy and nutritional counseling tailored to meet an individual’s needs. They are qualified to practice across a span of settings, including hospitals, outpatient clinics, research institutions, or local communities, to name a few. To earn the credentials of Registered Dietitian (RD) or Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN), a person needs to complete the criteria set forth by governing bodies like the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND) in the United States or the Dietitians Association of Australia ( 1 , 2 ). Additionally, in some countries, people may earn the title of “registered nutritionist,” which is synonymous with “registered dietitian” and requires certification from a governing body. These are professional organizations that oversee the field of dietetics in their respective countries. To clarify, the credentials of RD and RDN are interchangeable. However, RDN is a more recent designation. Dietitians can choose which credential they would rather use. To earn these credentials , dietitians-to-be must first earn a bachelor’s degree or equivalent credits from an accredited program at a university or college. Typically, this requires an undergraduate science degree, including courses in biology, microbiology, organic and inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology, as well as more specialized nutrition coursework. As of January 1, 2024, all dietetics students must also hold a master’s degree to qualify for their RD board examination in the United States ( 3 ). In addition to formal education, all dietetics students in the United States must apply for and be matched with a competitive internship program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Similar internships may be required in other countries. Internships typically expose the student to 900–1,200 unpaid supervised practice hours across the 4 domains of practice, with careful adherence to competencies, or specific areas of study, complemented by in-depth projects and case studies outside of those hours. Furthermore, the student must usually pass an exit exam mirroring the content of the board exam before completing the internship. The successful completion of these requirements qualifies them to take a board examination. Finally, a dietetics student who passes the board exam in their respective country can apply to become a registered dietitian. Earning dietitian credentials requires national board certification. What’s more, 13 states, including Rhode Island, Alabama, and Nebraska, require that dietitians be licensed in order to practice. The remaining states either don’t regulate this profession or provide state certification or optional licensing ( 4 ). The process of licensing sometimes has additional requirements, like passing a jurisprudence exam. This is meant to ensure that dietitians practice under a code of conduct to protect public safety. The dietitian must also continue their professional development by completing continuing education credits, which helps them keep up with the ever-evolving field. There are four main domains of practice for dietitians — clinical, food service management, community, and research. Clinical dietitians are those who work in an inpatient hospital setting. Outpatient dietitians may also work in a hospital or clinic, but they work with people who aren’t admitted to inpatient care and are usually less ill. Both inpatient and outpatient dietitians provide support to the medical team to treat many acute and chronic illnesses. Dietitians in long-term care facilities may also supervise the nutrition of people with serious conditions that require ongoing care. They follow standards of practice and detail a person’s medical history and current status, including lab work and weight history. This allows them to assess acute needs, prioritizing life-threatening conditions. Inpatient and outpatient dietitians also provide nutrition education to people with specialized needs, such as those newly out of surgery, in cancer treatment, or diagnosed with chronic illnesses like diabetes or kidney disease. In the outpatient setting, they give more in-depth nutritional counseling working towards a nutrition-oriented goal. Dietitians may also work in other settings like research hospitals, universities, or food service management. They can advocate for public policies and provide expertise in the community setting, such as school districts or public health organizations like Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Food service management dietitians oversee the production of nutritionally adequate food that meets food safety guidelines within a large organization, such as a school district or military base. A community dietitian can help design and implement programs aimed at populations instead of individuals, such as community cooking initiatives or diabetes prevention interventions. They can also advocate for public policies with a focus on nutrition, food, and health issues. Research dietitians typically work in research hospitals, organizations, or universities. They operate within a research team headed by a primary investigator and carry out nutrition-focused interventions. Once dietitians have earned their credentials and are working in the field, they can go on to specialize in a particular subcategory, such as pediatrics or sports dietetics. Finally, dietitians may also run private practices to provide services like nutritional counseling. They may additionally teach in an academic or research institution or write about nutrition-related topics. Others may work as health and nutrition experts in media or as public speakers. Dietitians are qualified to manage nutrition therapy across a span of acute and chronic conditions. The type of conditions they treat depends most on the setting of their practice. This means that they can treat nutrition problems that may arise from cancer or its treatment, as well as work with a client to prevent the onset of diabetes. In hospitals, they treat a range of people, such as those who are clinically malnourished, as well as those who require nutrients via feeding tubes. Dietitians also treat people undergoing bariatric (weight loss) surgery or those with kidney issues, as these individuals can have many nutritional restrictions and benefit from individualized care to fully meet their bodies’ needs. Eating disorder dietitians have usually acquired additional training or education to treat this population. They work with a team of psychotherapists and doctors to help individuals recover from these disorders ( 5 ). Eating disorders include chronic starvation (anorexia nervosa) or binging and purging (bulimia) ( 5 , 6 ). Sports dietitians specialize in optimizing nutrition for enhanced performance in athletes. These dietitians may work in gyms or physical therapy clinics, as well as with a sports team or dance company ( 7 ). Dietitians can apply their expertise across a broad range of settings, such as hospitals, research institutions, and sports teams. They may prescribe nutrition therapy to help treat or prevent acute and chronic illnesses. In some countries, people may translate their title as “nutritionist” rather than “dietitian,” though their educational background closely resembles that of a dietitian. In the United States, the title “nutritionist” may encompass individuals with a broad range of credentials and training in nutrition. In over a dozen states, certain qualifications must be met before an individual can call themselves a nutritionist. Additionally, accredited certifications grant titles like Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) ( 8 ). In most states, those who receive these certifications have the authority to practice medical nutrition therapy and other aspects of nutrition care. In many states, such as Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, RDs and CNSs are granted the same state license, usually called a Licensed Dietitian Nutritionist (LDN) license. In states that don’t regulate the use of this term, anyone with an interest in diet or nutrition may call themselves a nutritionist. These individuals may apply their interest in nutrition to anything from running a food blog to working with clients. However, because uncredentialed nutritionists typically lack the expertise and training for medical nutrition therapy and nutrition counseling, following their advice could be considered harmful ( 9 ). Before consulting a nutritionist, you may want to check whether your state regulates who may use this title . In the U.S. states that don’t regulate the term, no degrees or credentials are required to be a nutritionist. You simply need an interest in the field. In states that do mandate licensure , the CNS or RD credential may required. Those with CNS credentials are health professionals like nurses or doctors with advanced health degrees who have sought out additional coursework, completed supervised practice hours, and passed an exam overseen by the Board for Certification of Nutrition Specialists. In the United States, CNSs have legal standing to treat health conditions in most states. Over a dozen states also regulate the title “Licensed Nutritionist” or the more generic “nutritionist.” CNSs or nutritionists with licensure may help treat any condition that an RD would. Like RDs, CNSs prescribe nutrition therapy, which is specific care meant to manage or treat illnesses or other conditions. CNSs may also oversee community nutrition education programs. Nonetheless, those without credentials or licensure may pursue approaches to nutrition that are outside the scope of traditional medicine. While some of these approaches may have robust scientific backing, others may not. Giving nutrition advice without the proper knowledge and training can be harmful, especially when counseling those with health conditions. As such, if you are considering consulting a nutritionist, you may want to ask if they are a CNS or have state licensure or certification, or another credential. In the United States, the term “nutritionist” encompasses a broad range of credentials and expertise. Several states specifically regulate this term. Additionally, nutritionists may pursue an advanced CNS certification. Dietitians and CNSs are credentialed, board-certified food and nutrition experts with extensive training and formal education. Depending on where they live, dietitians and nutritionists like CNSs may also need to meet additional requirements to be licensed to practice. Dietitians and CNSs can apply their expertise across a range of settings, including hospitals, academic institutions, and food service management. Some specialize in working with specific populations, such as children, athletes, or those with cancer or eating disorders. Meanwhile, in the United States, the term “nutritionist” is regulated by certain states but not others. Thus, in many states, anyone can call themselves a nutritionist. Though these titles can sometimes be easy to confuse, remember that professionals with the titles “RD” or “CNS” have advanced degrees in nutrition.

Here’s our process Nutritionists love to beat the meal-planning drum. I would know, I’m one of them! And while it is true that planning your meals in advance can help you eat healthier in the real world, pre-planning your family’s food isn’t always realistic. If you’d like to eat well (but just haven’t yet mastered the art of meal planning with color-coded tabs and itemized Pinterest lists), simply stocking a healthy pantry can be a big step in the right direction. Want to make your kitchen a one-stop shop of mealtime building blocks? Look to these 15 good-for-you pantry, fridge, and freezer essentials. If you have a can of chickpeas, you have the makings of all sorts of dinners (and lunches too). Drain the can and pop the little legumes into soups or stews for extra protein and fiber. Or mash them with lemon juice, fresh dill, and diced celery as the filling for a wrap. Then, of course, there’s the world of chickpea cakes, chickpea tacos, and chickpea salads to choose from. Leftover chickpeas can be kept in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week, and can even be frozen. For best results, dry canned chickpeas as much as possible, then place them on a baking sheet in a single layer in the freezer. Once frozen, store them in a zip-top bag or other airtight container. Despite their humble appearance, chickpeas are a veritable powerhouse of nutrition . One cup of the cooked beans contains 12.5 grams of fiber, 14.5 grams of protein, and just 4 grams of fat. They’re also quite high in manganese, which supports bone health, and folate, a B vitamin that helps create new cells and form DNA. There’s a reason chicken has the highest per capita availability of all meats in the U.S. It’s a total fan favorite for innumerable meals, including stir-fries, sandwiches, pastas, soups, casseroles, and more. Keep boneless, skinless chicken breasts on hand as a protein to build dinner around. Simply add a whole grain (like rice, quinoa, or pasta) and a vegetable (broccoli, green beans, or carrots, perhaps?) and dinner is well on its way. For a flavor boost, sprinkle pantry staple herbs and spices like dried basil, rosemary, oregano, or garlic powder on your chicken before cooking. Pardon us while we do a little chicken dance for chicken. It’s just that this meat is so simple to preserve for supplying healthy meals down the road. Raw chicken breast can be frozen in its original packaging (but will be easier to remove individually if you separate breasts into their own foil packets). Cooked chicken is also extremely easy to freeze. Just place it in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 9 months . The high-quality complete protein in this poultry choice can support your immune system, help you build muscle, and promote wound healing. Fresh salmon filets get plenty of homage for their versatility and healthy fats, but smoked salmon is an even easier route to healthy meals. Because it’s already cooked, it arrives ready for insertion into wraps (try a salmon-kale combo), salads, and pastas. Smoked salmon pairs especially well with the flavors of lemon, dill, smoky paprika, or cream cheese. Since smoked salmon typically comes in smaller packages, you may not have leftovers to save. If you do, though, you can keep it in a sealed container in the fridge for 1 week (or 1 month in the freezer). Just like fresh salmon, smoked salmon contains plenty of omega-3 fatty acids, known for their benefits for heart and brain health. It’s also got vitamins A and E, antioxidants that work to combat inflammation. Just beware its high sodium content of 600-1,200 milligrams per 100-gram serving. If you’re still on the fence about tofu, it’s possible you just haven’t tried it prepared well. Pressing the liquid out of extra-firm tofu gets it ready for delightfully crispy pan-frying, making it the perfect protein for stir fries, curries, and Asian noodle dishes. Its neutral flavor allows it to take on the essence of whatever sauce or seasoning you apply. Got leftovers after your pad Thai? Extra-firm tofu should be kept in the refrigerator in sealed packaging 5-7 days or the freezer for 4-6 months. Don’t fear the ’fu! Though still dogged by myths that it’ll alter your hormones, research shows that tofu is actually potentially beneficial for preventing hormone-related cancers like breast cancer. Meanwhile, it’s got plenty of plant-based protein ( 17 grams per 3.5-ounce serving) and over 50% of the Daily Value of calcium. In terms of cooking time, red lentils are fairly middle-of-the-road, with typical simmering times around 20-25 minutes. And though you could choose any of several lentil colors (including green, yellow, brown, and black), the red variety has an earthy flavor that’s mild and slightly sweet — just right for daal, an Indian stew featuring tomatoes, onions, and spices. (Try this gingery recipe !) Cooked lentils can be a companion to next-day sautéed greens or serve as a high-fiber topping for baked sweet potatoes. Or simply refrigerate them in a sealed container for 5-7 days. As a member of the pulse family, lentils have health benefits galore. Their mix of fiber and antioxidants make them a friend to heart health, and they’re surprisingly high in protein at 46 grams per cup (dried). For a last-minute dinner fix, there’s nothing like a box of pasta. And if you make it a box of whole wheat spaghetti, you’ll get sturdy, thin (but not too thin) noodles that go with just about everything. Use whole wheat spaghetti as the base of a Mediterranean-inspired pasta featuring sun-dried tomatoes, artichokes, and olives. Or let it soak up a jarred or homemade pesto, plus cannellini beans and fresh arugula. Extra uncooked whole wheat spaghetti needs no special storage instructions, but the cooked kind needs to be refrigerated. (You can keep it there for 3-5 days.) Cooked pasta can also be frozen, but might come out mushy when reheated. Whole wheat spaghetti has a sizable dose of fiber, which helps regulate digestion, may promote healthy weight maintenance, and can help reduce cholesterol. When you need a grain in a casserole, stir-fry, or grain salad, try fluffy, nutty quinoa. It makes a nice change from the usual rice. Simply boil quinoa in a 1:2 ratio with water or broth, then simmer about 20 minutes or until tender. Once you’ve cooked and fluffed quinoa for one meal, it can go on to provide carb-y substance in other meals, too. Store it in the fridge in a sealed container for up to 1 week and pull it out whenever you’re ready to reuse it in salad (like this intriguingly fruity one ) or stuffed grilled zucchini . Take your pick of quinoa’s numerous health benefits ! Its fiber helps keep you full, can promote weight loss, and promotes healthy bowel movements. Then there’s its substantial protein content, its anti-inflammatory flavonoids, and its high levels of magnesium, manganese, copper, and other micronutrients. In your efforts to stock your pantry for healthy meals, don’t forget breakfast! In under 2 minutes in the microwave, quick-cooking oats become a palette for morning add-ins like sliced banana, peanut butter , blueberries, pepitas, or protein powder. No two bowls need ever be alike. A bowl of leftover oatmeal isn’t likely to appeal the next day — but even a small amount of extra dry quick-cooking oats can get put to good use. Sprinkle some into muffins or add it to meatloaf for sturdiness. Oats take their place in the pantheon of so-called “superfoods” for good reason. Their soluble fiber has been linked to reduced cholesterol , while their beta glucan can help stabilize blood sugar . Meanwhile, diets rich in whole grains (like oats) may lower the risk of colorectal cancer . Veggie, chicken, beef — not sure which broth to choose? You may want to try bone broth, an all-purpose choice that works well with all sorts of flavors. (Though all are made from animal bones, some bone broths are also steeped with additions like herbs, spices, and vegetables.) Bone broth can create hearty soups and savory sauces, and it’s a great alternative to water for cooking rice and quinoa. Feel free to substitute it in recipes that call for other types of broth, like beef taco soup , chicken a la king , or even mac and cheese. After opening, you can keep bone broth in its original packaging in the refrigerator for 4-5 days. Or freeze it by pouring it into ice cube trays for easy small portions. Though bone broth may not be the miracle food some people claim, it does have promise for promoting health. Because it’s made by simmering animal bones, it contains collagen, glucosamine, and chondroitin, which could reduce joint pain. Other potential benefits include improvements in digestive health, sleep, and brain function. Sweet potatoes’ earthy flavor pairs well with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, and their culinary versatility shines in global cuisine from Mexican to Indian dishes. Add cooked diced sweet potatoes to tacos, curries, or pasta. Or pop them in the oven whole as a reliable baked side dish. In a zip-top bag, leftover mashed sweet potatoes will keep in the fridge for 3-5 days. Save them for a novel, nutritious addition to smoothies or muffins. The ample potassium in sweet potatoes keeps nerves and muscles firing properly, while their soluble fiber helps lower cholesterol and steady blood sugar. Keeping a bag of spinach in the freezer is a surefire route to healthy, easy meals. Egg dishes like quiche and frittatas, spinach lasagna, and even smoothies are all just waiting for the veggie goodness of frozen greens. Frozen spinach that’s been cooked can stay refrigerated for 3-5 days. Spinach is famous for its high levels of iron, the mineral that helps oxygenate blood. But it’s also quite high in fiber and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin, which support eye health. Pizza, pasta, salads — fresh tomatoes make their way into so many best-loved meals. Keeping smaller grape tomatoes on hand lets you create your tomato-y favorites with less slicing and dicing. One delicious way to hang onto leftover grape tomatoes even longer: Roast them! Bake the fruits with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of salt and pepper at 400°F for about 40 minutes, stirring halfway through. Estimates vary on how long roasted tomatoes will keep in the fridge (some say up to 2 weeks). Use your senses to assess whether they’re still good for use. Grape tomatoes are a well-rounded fruit in more ways than one! They contain the antioxidant lycopene, famous for its role in reducing the risk of heart disease and cancer. Plus, they’re a significant source of folate, potassium, and vitamins C and K. How many recipes start with a drizzle of olive oil? Too many to mention — but we’ll list a few! Tasty ideas for EVOO include dipping sauces (like this garlicky kale and spinach dip ), a dinnertime hash (like this one with pastrami ), or an appetizing crostini . When it comes to storing olive oil , you really only need to know one thing: Keep the oil in a cool, dark place in a dark or opaque bottle. It’ll stay good for up to 2 years. Olive oil’s monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) have lots to offer for health. Research has associated MUFA consumption with reduced risk of overall mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, cardiovascular events, and stroke. No wonder EVOO is a staple of the heart-healthy Mediterranean diet! Onions equate to a savory flavor boost in just about any recipe. Sauté them in a little olive oil as the foundation for rice pilaf or French onion soup, or include their caramelized sweetness in a blend of roasted vegetables. Onions will keep on the countertop for weeks, but once you’ve removed their skin and sliced into them, it’s best to store them in a zip-top bag or other sealed container in the fridge. Leftovers can garnish hamburgers, falafel, or wraps. Some research shows that onions have antimicrobial properties, helping to defend you against infections. Apples have long been a lunchbox staple, but lunch isn’t the only meal they’re good for. Consider diced apple as an oatmeal add-in, fry apples to complement pork chops, or make a quick fruit salad to accompany breakfast for dinner. One of apples’ top selling points is their longevity. In the refrigerator, they can last up to 6 weeks! Vitamins C, potassium, fiber, and antioxidants like quercetin, catechin, and chlorogenic acid mean apples are a boon for overall health. Studies have associated eating them with decreased BMI, cardiovascular disease risk, type 2 diabetes, overall mortality. When you have healthy tools at your disposal, you can toss together meals that require minimal effort and fill you up with wholesome nutrients.

Here’s our process Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role in supporting heart, eye, and brain health, and in lowering inflammation and cholesterol, among other benefits. They’re abundant in cold-water fatty fish and other seafood and in lesser amounts in plant-based foods, such as nuts, seeds, and plant oils. But if you don’t eat these foods often, omega-3 supplementation through fish oil is an easy and helpful way to increase your intake of this essential nutrient. Here are our picks of the best fish oil supplements on the market. Disclaimer: Some of the products below were provided to Healthline testers for free. Our opinions and reviews are ours alone , and have not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by the brands. Our Medical Standards and Insights team has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline. To choose the brands on this page, we considered all the vitamin brands that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further. When rounding up the best fish oil supplements, we considered the following factors: Fish oil is a top source of omega-3 fatty acids, called polyunsaturated fats, which play important roles in many processes in your body, including those involving inflammation, immunity, heart health, and brain function. There are three main types of omega-3 fatty acids: All omega-3s are anti-inflammatory and may have a positive effect on many conditions thought to be related to chronic inflammation, particularly heart disease. EPA and DHA may also help lower high triglyceride levels , a risk factor for heart disease. Additionally, omega-3s play a key role in vision and eye health, as they’re necessary for eye development. However, while some studies suggest that they may help in the treatment of dry eye disease , other research has turned up conflicting results . Omega-3s are also important for brain health and may support proper neurological development during infancy and childhood. In older adults, omega-3 supplementation may play a role in promoting brain function and preventing cognitive decline. The most common side effect of fish oil supplements is fishy burps, but several “burpless” fish oil products are now on the market that claim to cut down on this unpleasant but harmless side effect. Some people might also experience digestive issues after taking fish oil, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation. If you experience nausea or vomiting after taking fish oil, you can check the expiration date. The oil may deteriorate and become rancid. Consider lowering your dose or taking the supplement with a meal to decrease any uncomfortable side effects. Also, check with a doctor before taking fish oil if you’re taking other medications or have any underlying health conditions, as high doses could increase the risk of bleeding or suppress immune function. Research on the potential effects of fish oil on cholesterol levels is conflicting. According to a 2021 study , higher blood levels of DHA could be linked to lower LDL (bad) cholesterol levels. On the other hand, one review concluded that fish oil supplements could actually increase LDL cholesterol, while other research suggests that eating fresh fish might be a better option for improving cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Therefore, it’s best to consult a doctor before taking fish oil if you have high cholesterol levels. You can take fish oil every day. However, taking high doses of fish oil (at least 900 mg of EPA plus 600 mg DHA) over time may promote immune system suppression because of the powerful anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fats. It’s important to check the dosages of EPA and DHA in your fish oil before you purchase so that you don’t buy one that could lead to this effect. Most health organizations recommend consuming 200 to 600 mg of combined EPA and DHA per day, with slight variations depending on your age and health status. For ALA, the daily recommended intake is 1.1 g per day for women and 1.6 g per day for men. Nordic Naturals is our top pick for the best omega-3 brand. Its Ultimate Omega supplement third-party tested and Friend of the Sea certified, and it also provides a COA for all products on its website. Look for fish oil derived from wild-caught, sustainably sourced varieties of fatty fish that are lower in mercury , such as mackerel, anchovies, or sardines. Some people might also prefer opting for cod liver oil instead, as it provides other important nutrients in addition to omega-3s, including vitamins A and D. If reducing inflammation is your goal, look for a fish oil supplement that contains a good amount of DHA in each serving. Carlson Labs The Very Finest Fish Oil has the highest amount of DHA per serving on our list. According to one 2021 study , while both DHA and EPA can help decrease markers of inflammation, DHA may have a broader effect. Fish oil supplements that combine omega-3 fatty acids with other ingredients, like CoQ10, can be a great choice to help support brain function . Thorne’s Omega-3 contains CoQ10, and a 2023 study found that higher blood levels of this compound could be linked to improved cognitive function. In addition to providing omega-3 fatty acids, some types of fish oil (like cod liver oil) may also contain other nutrients like vitamins A and D. This may be appealing if you’re taking these vitamins separately and looking for a simple way to streamline your supplement routine. But while fish oil is one type of omega-3 supplement, there are several other varieties that may be a better fit, depending on your preferences. For example, a plant-based omega-3 supplement might be a better option for those who prefer to avoid fish. In fact, research suggests that algae-based omega-3 supplements may be as effective at increasing levels of DHA as fish oil. If you have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) , consider opting for a fish oil supplement that pairs omega-3s with CoQ10. Thorne Omega-3 with CoQ10 , for example, provides 630 mg of combined EPA and DHA with 30 mg of CoQ10, making it one of the best omega-3 supplements for PCOS on our list. Research from 2022 suggests that CoQ10 may be beneficial for the treatment of PCOS by improving insulin resistance, balancing hormone levels, and improving lipid levels. Fish oil is a source of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, which are healthy fats that are good for your brain and heart. So, fish oil is the source, and omega-3 is the nutrient inside. One isn’t better than the other, you’re not really choosing between them. Fish oil is just one way to get omega-3. Some people prefer getting it from plants or algae, especially if they’re vegan or vegetarian.  There are many types of fish oil supplements, each from a different source and with varying amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. When shopping for an omega-3 supplement, it’s best to choose a product that’s been third-party tested to make sure the contents match the label and supplement facts panel. You’ll also want to consider which form of supplement you prefer, such as a liquid, capsule, or gummy, and your preferred dose. However, keep in mind that more is not always better. In fact, excessive intake may do more harm than good. For best results, try taking the supplement alongside a balanced diet to help maximize its potential benefits.

Factors like your age, sex, and starting point may affect how long it takes you to lose weight. Experts recommend losing 1 to 2 pounds per week to maintain a safe, effective, and healthy weight loss regimen. Weight loss occurs when you consistently consume fewer calories than you burn each day. This is known as a calorie deficit. Being in a calorie deficit is usually done through exercise and eating a well-balanced diet. However, other factors may influence the rate at which you expend energy and, therefore, lose weight. Keep reading to learn more about the factors that affect weight loss and how long it takes to lose weight. Many people claim to have the secret to help you lose up to 10 pounds (lb) in 1 week . But drastic weight loss like this isn’t safe, effective, or sustainable. Research suggests aiming to lose 5% to 10% of your body weight during the first 6 months of your weight loss journey. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends losing 1 to 2 lb of body weight weekly. Maintaining a calorie deficit is crucial for weight loss, but it’s also important to set a realistic calorie goal. On average, reducing your calorie intake by 500 calories is enough to help you lose around 1 lb weekly. Consider speaking with a healthcare professional if you’re unsure about your weight loss target and how many calories you should consume to reach your goals. They can help you develop a sustainable plan. Learn more about how to set realistic and sustainable weight loss goals . Any food or beverage you consume that has calories counts toward your overall calorie intake. That said, the number of calories you burn each day, known as total daily energy expenditure, is a bit more complicated. Energy expenditure comprises three major components : Several factors affect the rate at which you lose weight. Many of them are out of your control. Weight loss occurs in several stages . You’re likely to experience more weight loss during the first few weeks of your journey as your body adjusts to being in a calorie deficit and exercising more frequently. After a few months, however, you may reach a weight loss plateau . Research suggests this is due to physiological and hormonal changes that occur as your body tries to regain the weight it has lost for survival. This concept is called metabolic adaptation. Understanding weight loss stages may help you stay on top of your progress. Some research suggests that males and females may burn calories at different speeds. For instance, a 2023 study found that males may have a higher BMR due to more body mass and fat-free mass. This means they burn more calories at rest. An 8-week study including more than 2,000 participants eating an 810-calorie diet also found that males lost 16% more weight than females, with relative weight loss of 11.8% in males and 10.3% in females. On average, people gradually gain weight until age 75 years , but after this, body weight may start to decrease. Older adults tend to experience increases in fat mass and decreases in bone density and muscle mass. Muscle mass weighs more than fat. Older adults are also more likely to have some health conditions that may cause a loss of muscle mass and function, such as sarcopenia . Similarly, they’re more likely to have multiple health conditions, which could increase BMR. These factors may all contribute to unintentional weight loss. Your initial body mass and composition may affect how quickly you can expect to lose weight. It’s important to understand that different absolute weight losses (in pounds) can correspond to the same relative percentage of weight loss in different individuals. For example, a 250-lb person who loses 10 lb will lose an equal percentage of their body weight as a 125-lb person who loses 5 lb. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Body Weight Planner is a useful guide to help you determine how much you can lose based on your initial weight, age, sex, and how many calories you take in and expend. The extent of your calorie deficit may affect how quickly you lose weight. For example, consuming 500 fewer calories per day for 8 weeks will likely result in greater weight loss than eating 200 fewer calories per day. However, be sure not to make your calorie deficit too large . Doing so may increase your risk of nutrient deficiencies and losing muscle mass rather than fat mass. Several other factors can also affect your weight loss rate, including : There are innumerable weight loss diets available, each promising great results. But it’s important to note that no single diet is the best for weight loss. A 2020 review of 121 studies examined the weight loss effects of 14 popular diets with different macronutrient ratios. Researchers found that weight loss occurred in all diets, and there were no significant differences long term. What matters most is sticking to a manageable calorie deficit and eating a well-balanced diet , which includes : Remember, don’t drastically reduce the number of calories you eat daily. Following a very low calorie diet for long periods is difficult and may contribute to eventually eating more calories and regaining weight. Consider cutting 500 to 750 calories daily for a short period and then revising your calorie intake goals afterward. For the best results, combine a well-balanced diet with regular exercise and high quality sleep. Learn more about 16 foods to help promote weight loss . While most people hope for fast, rapid weight loss, it’s important that you don’t lose too much weight too quickly. Rapid weight loss may cause several side effects and complications, such as : Consider speaking with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to build the best weight loss plan for you. Some early signs of weight loss may include your clothes fitting more loosely, feeling less hungry and tired, having more muscle definition, and having a better mood. There’s no single timeline for losing belly fat, as it depends on several factors. Most studies show that you can’t target a specific body part for fat loss, known as spot reduction . Fat distribution also varies for each person, which means you may have more fat around your abdominal area, while others have more in their arms. Focusing on maintaining a calorie deficit by eating a well-balanced diet and getting regular exercise could help you lose overall fat, which may contribute to belly fat loss. Weight loss occurs when you consume fewer calories than you burn. Many factors affect your weight loss rate, including your sex, age, physical activity levels, starting weight, sleep, and the extent of your calorie deficit. Remember, weight loss is not a linear process. Some weeks, you may lose more weight, while other weeks, you may lose less or none at all. That’s OK. What matters is keeping things healthy and sustainable.  Share this article This article is based on scientific evidence, written by experts and fact checked by experts.

Certain eating plans, including the Autoimmune Protocol diet and a grain—or gluten-free diet, may help reduce inflammation that contributes to Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition that gradually destroys thyroid tissue via lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that are part of your immune system The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped endocrine gland at the base of the neck that secretes hormones affecting nearly every organ system. It also controls metabolism and growth. Eventually, damage to this gland leads to insufficient thyroid hormone production. This article explains the diet and lifestyle modifications most likely to benefit those with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is one of the most common thyroid disorders in the United States and other developed countries. Even when treated with medication, its symptoms may significantly affect quality of life. Research shows that diet and lifestyle play vital roles in managing Hashimoto’s, as numerous individuals find that their symptoms persist even with medication. Plus, many people who exhibit symptoms aren’t given medication unless they have altered hormone levels. Specifically, diet and lifestyle changes can help with several different factors related to Hashimoto’s. For example, cutting certain foods out may help reduce inflammation, which is often tied to diet and may be a driving factor in Hashimoto’s. Diet and lifestyle modifications can also help reduce your chance of developing comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes . Plus, these changes may help slow or prevent thyroid damage caused by elevated thyroid antibodies and manage body weight, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. That said, every person with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis responds differently to treatment, which is why an individualized approach is so important. The following are some evidence-based dietary tips to help treat Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Many studies indicate that those with Hashimoto’s are more likely to have celiac disease than the general population. As such, experts recommend that everyone diagnosed with Hashimoto’s be screened for celiac disease . What’s more, some evidence suggests that gluten – and grain-free diets may benefit people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. In a 6-month study of 34 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a gluten-free diet reduced thyroid antibody levels while improving thyroid function and vitamin D levels, compared with a control group. Other research notes that people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis — or autoimmune diseases in general — likely benefit from a gluten-free diet even if they don’t have celiac disease. Learn more: The gluten-free diet: a beginner’s guide with meal plan and everything you need to know about the grain-free diet . The Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) diet is designed for people with autoimmune diseases. It removes potentially harmful foods like grains, dairy, nightshades , added sugar, coffee, legumes, eggs, alcohol, nuts, seeds, refined sugars, oils, and food additives. In a 10-week study of 16 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the AIP diet significantly improved quality of life scores and significantly decreased levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Although these results are promising, larger longer-duration studies are needed. This is also an diet that should be prescribed and monitored by an experienced healthcare professional. Learn more: AIP (autoimmune protocol) diet: a beginner’s guide . Lactose intolerance is very common among people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. If you suspect lactose intolerance, cutting out dairy may aid digestive issues, as well as thyroid function and medication absorption. Keep in mind that this strategy may not work for everyone, as some people with Hashimoto’s tolerate dairy perfectly well. Learn more: Lactose-free diet: Foods to eat and avoid. Inflammation may be a driving force behind Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. As such, an anti-inflammatory diet rich in fruits and vegetables may significantly improve symptoms. A study of 218 women with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis found that markers of oxidative stress — a condition that causes chronic inflammation — were lower in those who ate fruits and vegetables more frequently. Learn more: Anti-inflammatory foods to eat . Following a diet low in added sugar and highly processed foods but rich in whole, nutrient-dense foods may help improve one’s health, manage one’s weight, and reduce Hashimoto’s-related symptoms. Whenever possible, prepare your meals at home using nutritious foods like vegetables, fruits, proteins, healthy fats , and fiber-rich carbs. Learn more: 11 simple ways to focus on whole foods instead of clean eating and Whole-foods, plant-based diet: a detailed beginner’s guide . Several supplements may help lower inflammation and thyroid antibodies in people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Plus, those with this condition are more likely to be deficient in certain nutrients, so supplementing may be necessary Beneficial supplements include: Note that supplementing with high doses of iodine in the absence of an iodine deficiency may lead to adverse effects in those with Hashimoto’s. Don’t take high dose iodine supplements unless a healthcare professional has directed you to do so. Learn more: Supplements and thyroid health: What to know . If you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, a nutrient-dense diet may help reduce the severity of your symptoms and improve your overall health. Focus on the following foods . Keep in mind that some people with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis avoid a few of the foods mentioned above, such as grains and dairy. It’s important to experiment with your diet to find out what foods work best for you. Learn more: What’s the best diet for hypothyroidism? Eliminating or restricting the following foods may help reduce Hashimoto’s symptoms and improve your overall health : Note that some cruciferous vegetables and soy products contain goitrogens , which are substances that may interfere with thyroid hormone production Yet cruciferous vegetables are highly nutritious, and cooking them diminishes their goitrogenic activity. Thus, they are unlikely to interfere with thyroid function unless eaten in extremely large amounts. Some evidence also suggests that soy harms thyroid function as well, so many people with Hashimoto’s choose to avoid soy products . Nonetheless, more research is needed. Although these recommendations may help many individuals, it’s important to experiment with your diet to find the best method for you. Working with a dietitian who specializes in autoimmune diseases like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis can help you narrow down potentially problematic foods and set up an eating pattern that’ll help you feel your best. A study done in 60 women with Hashimoto’s found that engaging in stress reduction practices helped to reduce their depression and anxiety, improve overall quality of life, and lower thyroid antibodies. Additionally, for maximum absorption, it’s best to take thyroid medication on an empty stomach at least 30–60 minutes before breakfast or at least 3–4 hours after dinner. Keep in mind that when you’re first starting medication, it may take a few weeks or longer to start feeling better. If your symptoms aren’t improving, speak with a healthcare professional about other options. As Hashimoto’s symptoms may significantly affect your quality of life and mental health, be sure to find a healthcare team that you trust. This may take some time, but it’s essential to getting the right treatment. If you adopt the AIP diet, you will want to cut out eggs. Otherwise, you should ask your doctor whether eggs should be included in your diet, as every person is different. Unlike other autoimmune diseases, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis doesn’t have distinct “flares.” Instead, it slowly damages the thyroid gland over time. Eventually, it can progress to hypothyroidism, where the thyroid can no longer produce enough hormones. Certain factors can affect the severity of Hashimoto’s symptoms. This includes nutritional deficiencies, as well as medications and supplements if they interfere with your thyroid medication. Stress can also worsen the condition by slowing down metabolism and hormone levels. Learn more: What are the symptoms (and causes) of a Hashimoto’s flare-up? Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is a common autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid . It causes numerous symptoms that may persist even if you take thyroid medication. Research shows that dietary and lifestyle changes can significantly improve your symptoms and boost your overall health. However, every person with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is different, so it’s fundamental to find a dietary pattern that suits your needs. A dietitian or other healthcare professional who specializes in autoimmune diseases may be able to help you find an eating pattern that works for you.

To eat healthier, start by making small changes. Make each meal or snack contain nutrient-dense foods, and try to avoid processed foods. Healthy eating does not have to be complicated. You can nourish your body while still enjoying the foods you love. Food is meant to be enjoyed — not feared, counted, weighed, and tracked. Keep reading to learn more about what healthy eating means and how to make it work for you. Food is what fuels you and delivers the calories and nutrients your body needs to function. If your diet is deficient in calories or one or more nutrients, your health may suffer. If you eat too many calories, you may experience weight gain . People with obesity have a significantly increased risk of: Additionally, the quality of your diet affects your disease risk, longevity , and mental health . Research suggests that diets rich in ultra-processed foods are linked to increased mortality . Studies have also found that diets rich in ultra-processed foods are associated with a greater risk of conditions like cancer and heart disease . On the other hand, diets comprising mostly whole , nutrient-dense foods—such as the Mediterranean diet —are associated with increased longevity and disease protection . Diets rich in highly processed foods may also increase the risk of depressive symptoms, particularly among people who get less exercise. If your current diet is high in ultra-processed foods and beverages but low in whole foods like vegetables , nuts , and fish , you’re likely not eating enough of certain nutrients . This may negatively affect your overall health. Although certain people need — or choose — to avoid particular foods or adopt diets for health reasons, you don’t have to follow any specific diet to feel your best. “Healthy eating” simply means fueling your body with mostly nutritious foods . The specifics may be different for each person depending on location, financial situation, culture, and taste preferences. Even though calories are important, your primary concern should be nutrients. That’s because nutrients, including protein , carbs , fat , vitamins , and minerals, are what your body needs to thrive. “Nutrient density” refers to the amount of nutrients in a food in relation to the calories it provides. All foods contain calories, but not all foods are nutrient-dense. For example, egg whites are much lower in calories and fat than whole eggs . However, an egg white provides 1% or less of the Daily Value (DV) for iron , phosphorus , zinc , choline , and vitamins A and B12 , while a whole egg packs 5–21% of the DV for these nutrients. Some nutrient-dense foods, such as numerous fruits and veggies, are low in calories. Others like nuts, Greek yogurt , egg yolks , avocado , and fatty fish are high in calories. That’s perfectly OK! Just because a food is high in calories doesn’t mean that it’s bad for you. On the same note, just because a food is low in calories doesn’t make it a healthy choice. As a general rule, try to mostly eat foods that are high in nutrients like protein, fiber , healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. These foods include veggies, fruits , nuts, seeds , beans , fatty fish , and eggs. Following a diet that’s rich in different kinds of food: Eating a variety of foods may be difficult if you’re a picky eater. If that’s the case, try to introduce new foods one at a time. If you don’t eat many vegetables, start by adding a favorite vegetable to one or two meals per day. You can build off of this at a pace that is comfortable to you. Although you may not enjoy trying new foods, research shows that the more you’re exposed to a food, the greater your chances of growing accustomed to it. Macronutrients — the main nutrients you get from food — are carbs, fat, and protein. (Fiber is considered a type of carb.) Generally, your meals and snacks should be balanced between the three. In particular, adding protein and fat to fiber-rich carb sources makes dishes more filling and tasty . For example, if you’re snacking on a piece of fruit , adding a spoonful of nut butter or a bit of cheese helps keep you fuller than if you were to eat the fruit alone. However, it’s fine if your diet isn’t balanced all the time. Counting macros and following a set macronutrient plan isn’t necessary for most people — except athletes, people seeking a specific body composition, and those who need to gain muscle or fat for medical reasons. Plus, counting macros and obsessing about staying within a certain macro range may lead to an unhealthy fixation with food and calories or cause disordered eating tendencies. It’s important to note that some people may thrive on diets that are low in carbs and high in fat and protein — or low in fat and high in carbs. However, even on these diets, macronutrient counting typically isn’t necessary. For example, if you feel your best on a low carb diet, simply choosing low carb foods like nonstarchy veggies , proteins, and fats more often than high carb foods will usually suffice. One of the best ways to improve your diet is to cut back on ultra-processed foods . You don’t have to avoid processed foods completely. In fact, many healthy foods like shelled nuts, canned beans, and frozen fruits and veggies have been processed in one way or another. In contrast, highly processed products like soda , mass-produced baked goods, candy, sugary cereals, and certain boxed snack food contain little if any whole food ingredients. The first step to following a healthier diet is to make food one of your priorities. This doesn’t mean that you have to spend hours meal prepping or cooking elaborate meals, but it does require some thought and effort. Going to the grocery store regularly will help ensure that you have healthy choices in your fridge and pantry. A well-stocked kitchen makes choosing healthy meals and snacks much easier. When grocery shopping, stock up on: If you’re drawing a blank at mealtime, think in threes: If you’re not used to cooking or grocery shopping, focus on a single meal or just a few meals. Shop for the ingredients for a couple of breakfast or dinner dishes at a time. Once that becomes a habit, add more meals until you can shop for a week’s worth in one trip. To develop a healthy relationship with food, you have to have the right tools. Working with a healthcare team, such as a registered dietitian and psychologist who specializes in eating disorders , is the best way to start mending your relationship with food. Food restrictions, fad dieting, and self-prescribed notions like “getting back on track” won’t help and may be harmful. Working on your relationship with food may take time, but it’s necessary for your physical and mental health. Here are some more tips for you to get started with healthy eating: You can also work with a registered dietitian, especially if you’re not sure how to start improving your diet. A dietitian can help you develop a sustainable, nutritious eating plan that works for your needs and schedule. Although healthy eating may look a bit different for everyone, balanced diets are generally rich in nutrient-dense foods, low in highly processed foods, and comprised of filling meals and snacks .

Palm oil is a type of vegetable oil made from the fruit of the Elaeis Guineensis tree, a palm tree native to parts of Africa. There’s a good chance that you’ve eaten palm oil or used products made with it. It’s used for cooking and as an ingredient in foods like crackers, butter substitutes, and frozen foods, as well as products like soap, shampoo, makeup, and even biofuel ( 1 ). However, the methods used to produce palm oil are highly unsustainable and wreak havoc on the environment of Southeast Asia. Nevertheless, the palm oil industry claims that this crop plays a significant role in the food system and provides jobs in the countries where it’s grown. As a dietitian concerned with the future of our global food system, I want to take an in-depth look at palm oil’s environmental impact, as it’s clear that our current use of palm oil isn’t sustainable long term. This article reviews some pressing sustainability issues with palm oil and explores a few ways that you can advocate for better production practices. Many of us don’t realize just how common palm oil is. In 2021, the world produced more than 167 million pounds (75.7 million kg) of it ( 2 ). Palm is already the most used vegetable oil in the world, and demand for it is only expected to grow ( 3 ). This oil rose in popularity during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries and again over the past few decades as manufacturers began looking for versatile ingredients to replace trans fats in processed foods. Palm oil not only acts as a preservative but also remains stable under high temperatures and has a mild flavor and smooth texture. Plus, growing and harvesting it is cost-effective. As the food industry realized palm oil’s perks, its use increased greatly during the 1970s and 1980s. This oil is now used in as many as half of all consumer goods ( 4 ). Palm oil’s use has grown exponentially over the past few decades. It’s hidden in many more products and foods than we tend to realize due to its versatile uses and effectiveness as a high volume crop. Just a few counties — mainly Indonesia and Malaysia — produce nearly 85% of the planet’s palm oil ( 2 ). Parts of Southeastern Asia, Africa, and Latin America where palm oil is grown are most affected by its production. Even so, because its impacts on the environment are so significant, the final toll of palm oil production may be much further reaching ( 5 ). Here are some of the most notable environmental concerns involving palm oil: Paradoxically, palm oil production is threatened by global warming, too. Not only do some palm varieties grow poorly in warmer temperatures, but flooding from rising sea levels also threatens palm-oil-producing countries like Indonesia ( 14 ). The palm oil industry is responsible for huge amounts of deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and pollution. As the industry continues to grow, these issues may only intensify. Palm oil production is lightly regulated — and sometimes not regulated at all. This situation gives rise to tensions between corporate interests and consumers or environmental groups demanding changes to how palm oil is made. Regulating palm oil may lead to higher prices for consumer goods, lower wages, and a loss of work for people who grow palm oil. Yet, excessive carbon emissions, such as those released by deforestation, are a threat to society as we know it ( 9 , 15 , 16 , 17 ). These are just a few issues to consider when it comes to regulating palm oil. Researchers have proposed reducing the industry’s emissions by only using land that has already been forested for palm plantations, protecting the most carbon-rich lands like peat forests, and better managing carbon-sensitive areas ( 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ). In the private sector, organizations like the European Palm Oil Alliance (EPOA) are making commitments against deforestation, land exploitation, and peat forest development. Grocery stores like Iceland Foods have reformulated store-brand items to remove palm oil ( 7 ). In some instances, governments have stepped in. The 2015 Amsterdam Declaration aimed to phase out all palm oil that isn’t certified sustainable by 2020. The partnership now includes nine countries, including France and the United Kingdom, and has expanded its commitment to eliminating agricultural deforestation ( 22 ). Despite these efforts, enforcement is challenging due to corporate influence and a lack of resources. For example, efforts like the Indonesian Palm Oil Pledge (IPOP) were less successful. Advertised as a commitment to stop deforestation and the development of peat forests, the IPOP was signed by Indonesia’s largest palm oil exporters in 2014 ( 23 ). The initiative fell apart just a few years later due to a lack of organization and external pressure from the industry. Some activists criticized the effort as little more than a political advertising stunt that only increased red tape around sustainability efforts. Currently, no one regulatory body oversees global palm oil production. Some nations have committed to using only sustainable palm oil, while private groups are advocating for a halt to deforestation and the development of carbon-rich lands. It’s a personal choice whether you decide to avoid palm oil or try to only use palm oils that have been sustainably and ethically sourced. Many of the controversies surrounding palm oil involve: It’s clear that palm oil production in its current form isn’t sustainable long term. Furthermore, organizations like Amnesty International , the International Labor Rights Forum , and Human Rights Watch have accused the palm oil industry of using child labor, failing to protect the lands of Indigenous people, and other human rights abuses. Still, simply replacing palm oil with other vegetable oils may not be a viable option ( 5 ). That’s because other vegetable oil crops would likely use even more resources — and thus contribute more to climate change — than palm oil does, as palm crops grow efficiently and have a significantly higher output than other oil-producing plants. If palm oil were produced ethically and sustainably, it could offer numerous benefits. Aside from being an effective cooking oil , it works well as a soap and fuel. Plus, people have been cooking with palm oil in Africa for thousands of years ( 1 , 24 ). Palm oil also has nutritional benefits because it contains healthy fats, numerous antioxidants , and vitamins A and E. Unrefined palm oil, also called red palm oil, may contain the most amount of nutrients since it’s cold pressed rather than heated during processing ( 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 ). Nevertheless, research on palm oil’s nutrients is conflicting. It may be healthiest when used in place of other less healthy fats like trans fats ( 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 ). Palm oil is rich in healthy fats, some vitamins, and antioxidants. Though it can be part of a healthy diet, some people choose to limit it or use only sustainably grown palm oil due to the industry’s environmental and human rights abuses. You can advocate against the harmful effects of palm oil in the following ways. Knowing how to spot palm oil on an ingredient list is essential to understanding how common it is and learning where it might be hiding in your own diet, hygiene, or wellness routine. It’s also key if you’ve decided to cut back your use of palm oil. Some of the most common ingredients derived from palm oil are: Purchasing palm oil that has been certified sustainable by an accrediting body lets industry leaders know that consumers are concerned about these issues. Some certifications may be designated by an icon on product labels. A few of the most common include: Malaysia and Indonesia each have government-led certification programs. Still, environmental advocates have questioned the credibility of such programs due to the influence of the palm oil industry ( 33 ). Don’t be afraid to reach out directly to palm oil producers, distributors, and companies that use palm oil in their products. Ask key players in the industry about their practices and encourage them to move toward sustainable palm oil. By signing online petitions, sending emails, or joining protests, you can encourage companies that rely on palm oil to adopt sustainability principles. Government policy can be wielded to stop deforestation and promote sustainable palm oil. Specific policies that would lessen palm oil’s environmental impact include: Sustainability promises and certifications are a step in the right direction, but the palm oil industry needs a systematic overhaul to remain viable into the future. Standing up to a major industry like the palm oil lobby might feel like a daunting task, but you won’t be alone. When ordinary citizens band together for a cause they’re passionate about, they can achieve extraordinary things. Some ways to campaign for change around palm oil include: You can advocate for sustainable palm oil by limiting how much you use it, buying products that are certified sustainable, requesting transparency from the palm oil industry, and putting pressure on its main players to find sustainable alternatives. Palm oil is abundant in the food system and common household products. However, its environmental impact is profound. Although certain concrete steps, such as halting deforestation and growing palm only on previously forested lands, could reduce palm oil’s environmental impacts, the palm oil industry has so far resisted these changes. Thus, if you’re worried about the impact palm oil is having on the world around you, you can take action by limiting your palm oil usage and purchasing products that are certified as sustainable. Try this today : Scan the foods in your pantry, the soaps on your shelves, and the cosmetics in your bag to locate hidden sources of palm oil in your home.

We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process (Note: Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses “men” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.) We re-evaluated the best multivitamins for men with the help of registered dietitian Kelli McGrane . With so many splashy brands giving the hard sell on social media, we wanted to get to the bottom of this question: What makes a good men’s multi anyway? You don’t have to spend a lot to support your diet, and you likely don’t need a vitamin with the highest percentage daily values (DV). That’s because a multivitamin is a support system, not a replacement system . If the DV percent for an ingredient is less than 100, that’s a nutrient you can be more diligent about consuming through food. Some people may have larger nutrient gaps in their diet and prefer a more comprehensive vitamin, but the majority of people can benefit from a vitamin that covers the basics. “Budget-friendly vitamins are more than up to the task of helping you crush your nutrient needs for the day,” says Kelli McGrane, MS, RD. Instead of judging by price, she recommends choosing products that are third-party tested and that include ingredients you’re not getting enough of in your diet. Consider this permission to bargain buy. Our team has vetted more than 100 products to decide on the best multivitamin for men. We’ve tested more than 20, talked to experts, and devoured ingredient labels. These are the top picks we recommend for most men. Disclaimer: Some of the products tested below were provided for free. Our opinions are ours alone and have not been reviewed, approved, or otherwise endorsed by the product manufacturers. We narrowed down the best multivitamins for men with our expert recommendations from registered dietitians Kelli McGrane, MS, RD , and Ellen Landes MS, RDN, CPT . We looked at ingredients, nutrients each vitamin offers, third-party testing, and price. All the products on our list have been rigorously reviewed by our vetting team, and our team considered: Our Medical Standards and Insights team has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline. To choose the products on this page, we considered all the multivitamins that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further. Kelli McGrane, MS, RD, is a registered dietitian and cookbook author with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Nutritional Science from Boston University. She has worked as a clinical dietitian at two Boston hospitals, a nutrition researcher for the University of Colorado and Children’s Hospital, and as a freelance nutrition writer and editor for several online publications. When choosing a multivitamin, it’s important to pay attention to the nutrients it contains. Micronutrient needs are highly personal and vary by age and sex. Chronic health conditions and medications can also affect micronutrient needs. However, adult men generally need to make sure to get enough of the following vitamins and minerals : As men age, vitamin B12 also becomes harder to absorb, and a supplement may be necessary. Multivitamins aren’t necessary for everyone, but if you’re unable to meet your nutrient needs through diet alone, a multivitamin could be a good idea. Men who may benefit from a multivitamin include those with: Additionally, as you age , it becomes harder to get enough of some nutrients, including vitamins B12 and D. But if you’re already taking dietary supplements, including some protein powders, or regularly consuming fortified foods , adding a multivitamin to your regimen could lead to an overconsumption of nutrients. It’s wise to talk with a healthcare professional about whether you could benefit from taking a multivitamin. Depending on your needs, they may advise you to take a single-nutrient supplement instead. Several multivitamins for men may contain other vitamins, minerals, herbs, or antioxidants that could be beneficial for prostate health . For example, saw palmetto and beta-sitosterol are commonly included in men’s supplements. These two substances may help support prostate health and manage urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostate hyperplasia, or enlargement of the prostate gland. Still, more research is needed. Though supplementing with certain nutrients and plant compounds may benefit prostate health, taking high doses of vitamin E may have the opposite effect. Some nutrients and herbs may not be recommended for certain people or may have negative interactions with medications. Always consult a healthcare professional before adding a new supplement to your wellness routine. More research is needed, but some evidence suggests that taking high doses of supplemental vitamin E may significantly increase the risk of prostate cancer in healthy men. Because of this, it’s best to avoid supplements that contain high doses of vitamin E unless it’s specifically recommended by a qualified healthcare professional. If you have questions about the safety of vitamin E supplements, consult a healthcare professional, like a doctor or dietitian, for advice. Research on the effectiveness of multivitamins is mixed, though they’re unlikely to cause harm in healthy people. A doctor may recommend a single vitamin rather than a multivitamin if a multivitamin contains nutrients you don’t need. Remember, multivitamins are not meant to replace a balanced diet , and not everyone will need a multivitamin. There are 13 essential vitamins and 7 main minerals adults need to get from their diets. That said, some nutrients are particularly important for men’s health include calcium, magnesium, selenium, all eight B vitamins, and vitamins A, C, D, and K. Depending on your diet, you may be able to meet your needs for these nutrients through food alone. Multivitamins designed for men and women typically differ in the types and quantity of nutrients they contain. For example, multivitamins for men may contain higher levels of selenium to support sperm health, and multivitamins for women may contain higher levels of iron to support menstrual health. There’s no best time of day to take your multivitamin. However, because fat-soluble vitamins are best absorbed when taken with a meal containing healthy fats, it’s a good idea to take your multivitamin with a meal to get the most out of it. Check out these two articles to help make supplement shopping a breeze: While it’s possible (and advisable) to meet your nutrient needs by consuming a balanced diet, some people may fall short of their needs. Given the wide variety of high quality multivitamins to choose from, you’re likely to find something that works for you. Just remember, it’s important to talk with a healthcare professional first, like a primary care doctor or registered dietitian, especially if you take other prescribed or over-the-counter medications.

Evenings at my house are chaotic. My partner and I have two-year-old twins, and that gap between preschool pickup and bedtime can be the toughest part of the day. We both have busy jobs and are always doing too many things at once — cooking, trying to remember if anyone fed the dog, and diplomat-level toddler negotiations, to name a few. Amidst all that, we’re supposed to be eating healthy foods, exercising, getting enough sleep, and practicing self-care. Who has time for all that? These days, my biggest healthy eating challenge is finding the time and energy to plan balanced meals for myself and our family. Increasingly, we can do it together in a way that we couldn’t when the twins were babies (I’m not even sure what we ate for the first two years of their lives, to be honest). They like to go grocery shopping and eat the foods they see us eating. I’m excited to keep moving in this direction together. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Toddler food whims change daily, and sometimes they just don’t want to eat anything. Evenings for me usually end up the same way — with two kids on the counter or one in my arms, spending time together and “helping” me cook dinner. This is our healthy eating reality. What’s yours? Illustration by Wenzdai Figueroa I am not a poster child for healthy eating. I will say I’ve trended better in that direction as an adult, but I used to follow what I now understand was a poorly planned vegetarian diet . I was a vegetarian from childhood through my mid-twenties, mostly existing on fruit, yogurt, cheese, bread, and pasta. My partner still likes to tease me about being a “milk-tarian.” What I didn’t understand then is that any diet, especially one that removes certain foods, requires planning and balance. I started planning more balanced meals that included a variety of food groups when I moved to Iceland in 2015. I also started eating fish, which is fresh and plentiful here. For me, this was a life-changing decision, and I’ve enjoyed exploring the culinary opportunities a more flexible diet has provided. These are my preferences, and a mostly pescatarian diet is what works for me. However, that doesn’t make it the right diet or eating pattern for you. Healthy eating is a journey — one that changes over time — and you have the power to determine which foods and eating pattern make you feel your best. We know healthy eating can be challenging. It can be tough to know where to start, we’re surrounded by nutrition misinformation, and healthy foods can be expensive or hard to find . Nevertheless, healthy eating is an important wellness goal for many people. In a study conducted by Healthline Media, 72% of respondents said that “eating healthy and nutritious foods” was their most important health or wellness goal. In another study we conducted, two-thirds of participants said they were interested in nutrition content. However, only one-third said they eat “very or extremely healthfully.” The rest reported their eating habits were either not at all, a little, or somewhat healthy. This really stood out to us, as it means the majority of these people wanted to eat well, yet fewer than one-third actually did so. So, what’s standing in the way? Change is hard, and life is busy . People want more than information and need actionable steps to get started, as well as support along their journey. Recommendations need to be accessible and affordable. Community and connection also matter. Furthermore, biases and inequities in our food system contribute to issues of access and health disparities. There’s also a clear need for cultural competence in nutrition — too often, what is considered “healthy” is seen through a homogenous, Western lens that often ignores and “others” foods and traditions with deep cultural roots. In this field, we have a responsibility to challenge and broaden our definition of healthy eating and provide more appropriate and relevant recommendations to better help people meet their health and wellness goals.

(Note: Sex and gender exist on spectrums. This article uses “women” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.) “When it comes to supplements, the price is not always a good reflection of the quality,” says Kelli McGrane, MS, RD . “There are plenty of expensive multivitamins that aren’t third-party tested for purity and potency or that contain types or amounts of nutrients that simply aren’t necessary for everyone.

Before beginning any new supplement, we recommend talking with a healthcare professional. Not everyone needs to take multivitamins, and a doctor may recommend a single-nutrient vitamin instead. There are many essential nutrients. However, some are particularly important to look for in a multivitamin, either because the nutrients play a key role in women’s health specifically or because women are more likely to consume inadequate amounts of them in their diets. These nutrients include: Still, keep in mind that depending on your diet, you may not need a supplement that contains all the nutrients listed above. Additionally, nutrient needs and amounts vary depending on your stage of life, among other factors. Looking to round out your wellness routine? Or didn’t see what you were looking for? Be sure to check out our other supplement roundups for women’s health: Healthline’s top picks for women’s multivitamin brands include Nature Made, Perelel , Mindbodygreen, and Ritual . These brands offer high ingredient quality, nutrient potency, and third-party testing on various products to suit different needs. Multivitamins can help certain people meet their nutrient needs. However, they can also increase nutrient intakes beyond the levels that are considered safe. In terms of improving overall health and preventing chronic diseases, multivitamins may play a role , but more research is needed. Research has also shown that healthy people are more likely to regularly take a multivitamin than those who have nutritional deficiencies. For this reason, the research on whether a multivitamin can improve health outcomes is inconclusive. However, a doctor may still recommend a multivitamin to help fill any nutrient gaps in your diet. Taking a multivitamin daily can help some people meet their needs, while it may lead to excessive intake of nutrients in others. For this reason, it’s important to carefully read supplement labels and identify any nutrients you’re already consuming regularly, either through your diet or through other supplements. It’s a good idea to check with a healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement, including a multivitamin. Learn more about vitamin overdose. Some vitamins, such as water-soluble vitamins, can be absorbed on an empty stomach. However, multivitamins also typically contain fat-soluble vitamins, which require dietary fat for absorption, so it’s best to take them with a meal or snack. To make it easier to remember to take your multivitamin, try taking your vitamin with the same meal each day. Multivitamins can help fill nutritional gaps for people who have difficulty meeting their nutrient needs through diet alone, as well as for people who are pregnant or nursing or have certain dietary restrictions. But not everyone needs a multivitamin, and regularly consuming some nutrients in excess can be detrimental to overall health. Also, keep in mind that multivitamins have the potential to interact with other supplements or prescription medications.

Walking into a grocery store without a plan is like heading on a road trip without a map. A little preparation goes a long way in helping you stay focused, avoid impulse buys, and make healthier choices. Start by planning a few meals and snacks you’d like to make during the week. If you’re new to meal prepping, start small. Focus on two to three main meals that can double as leftovers and use overlapping ingredients to cut down on cost and food waste. Once you know what meals you want to make, build a grocery list based on those ingredients. Organize it by category or store layout, such as produce, proteins, frozen, pantry, and dairy, to streamline your trip. A well-structured grocery list helps you shop more efficiently and supports healthier choices. Plus, studies show that grocery lists may help you make healthier choices while shopping. Try to base your list around whole, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. Here’s an example of what a healthy grocery list might include: Keep in mind that pantry staples like grains, canned goods, and nut butters don’t need to be purchased weekly. Once you build up your supply, you can do smaller, produce- and protein-focused shops between restocks. For more detailed healthy shopping list ideas, check out this article . Meal planning is key to staying organized, reducing food waste, and sticking to your grocery budget. Here’s how to put it into action: Meal planning is a game changer for your grocery budget and overall health. Start with small steps, and soon you’ll find yourself comfortably preparing healthy meals at home! Stop by this article for tips on meal prepping. If you aren’t a fan of frequent grocery store trips, stocking your kitchen with nonperishable and frozen foods is key. This can help you prepare nutritious meals and snacks even when you’re running low on fresh foods. It’s important to check your cabinets, pantry, fridge, and freezer to take inventory of what you need before going shopping. This can cut down on food waste and ensure that you’ve got the ingredients needed to prepare healthy meals. You’ll need to purchase fresh items like fresh fruits, veggies, dairy products, and other perishables more often. Meanwhile, nonperishable goods and foods that can be frozen can be purchased less often. Here are some ideas of long-lasting staples you can keep in your pantry and freezer: With a well-stocked kitchen, your bases will be covered, and you won’t have to stress about buying groceries as often. Just make sure you check your inventory before you go shopping to avoid purchasing items you already have. Cutting back on food waste isn’t just good for the planet, it’s good for your wallet and your meal prep routine, too. Much of what gets thrown out could have been used with just a bit of planning. Here are some ways to keep waste low: Being more mindful of expiration dates, proper storage, and meal rotation can significantly reduce how much food (and money) ends up in the trash. Healthy eating doesn’t have to be expensive . In fact, with a few smart habits, you can eat well without stretching your grocery budget. Here’s how: Also, consider meatless meals once or twice a week. Plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu are cost-effective and versatile. Grocery stores are designed to encourage more spending, not necessarily healthy choices. But knowing how to move through the store with intention can help. Start along the perimeter of the store, where you’ll typically find produce, meat, dairy, and other whole foods . After that, move into the center aisles for pantry staples, canned goods, and frozen foods. Don’t avoid entire aisles, just stay focused on what’s on your list. Ideally, you’ll want to focus on the following when grocery shopping: Finally, try to avoid shopping on an empty stomach, which can lead to impulse purchases. Stick to your plan and resist deals that don’t align with what you came to buy, especially those flashy displays of ultra-processed foods. Not all packaged foods are unhealthy, but some labels can be misleading. Terms like “natural,” “organic,” or “gluten-free” don’t automatically mean a product is the best choice for you. When checking labels, try to: Reading labels can be confusing. For a detailed guide to reading nutrition labels, check out this article . Everyone’s needs are different, but here’s an example of a nutrient-dense, versatile grocery cart: This list is not exhaustive, but it can act as a general guide for shopping trips. Of course, there’s also room for your favorite foods in a healthy, balanced diet. The point isn’t to completely avoid foods that are considered less healthy, like chips, ice cream, and cookies. Rather, a well-rounded diet should prioritize nutrient-dense foods that make you feel good and deliver the nutrients your body needs to thrive, all while leaving room for you to enjoy your favorite foods. Grocery shopping doesn’t have to be stressful. Making a list or meal plan, taking inventory of your kitchen, and stocking your freezer and pantry with long-lasting staples can make your shopping trips easier and more enjoyable. Try using some of the tips covered in this article, and before you know it, you’ll be a healthy grocery shopping pro. Try this today: Before your next trip to the grocery store, choose two dishes you’d like to cook during the upcoming week. Write down a shopping list — or print out the recipe’s ingredient lists — to bring to the store and see whether this helps you make smarter choices.

Food production creates an inevitable strain on the environment. Your daily food choices can greatly affect the overall sustainability of your diet. Though vegetarian and vegan diets tend to be more environmentally friendly, not everyone wants to give up eating meat altogether. This article covers some of the major effects of food production on the environment, as well as how to eat both meat and plants more sustainably. In short, here’s how to be an ethical omnivore. With the production of food for human consumption comes an environmental cost. The demand for food, energy, and water continues to rise with the increase in the world’s population, leading to increased stress on our planet. While the demand for these resources can’t be avoided altogether, it’s important to become educated about them to make more sustainable decisions surrounding food. One of the main modifiable factors when it comes to agriculture is land use. With half of the world’s habitable land now being used for agriculture, land use plays a big role in the environmental impact of food production ( 1 ). More specifically, certain agricultural products, such as livestock, lamb, mutton, and cheese, take up the majority of the world’s agricultural land ( 2 ). Livestock account for 77% of global farming land use, when grazing pastures and land used to grow animal feed are taken into consideration ( 2 ). That said, they only make up 18% of the world’s calories and 17% of the world’s protein ( 2 ). As more land is used for industrial agriculture, wild habitats are displaced, disrupting the environment. On a positive note, agricultural technology has drastically improved throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries ( 3 ). This improvement in technology has increased crop yield per unit of land, requiring less agricultural land to produce the same amount of food ( 4 ). One step we can take toward creating a sustainable food system is avoiding the conversion of forest land to agriculture land ( 5 ). You can help by joining a land preservation society in your area. Another major environmental impact of food production is greenhouse gases, with food production making up about one-quarter of global emissions ( 2 ). The main greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases ( 6 ). Greenhouse gases are one of the major purported factors responsible for climate change ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ). Of the 25% that food production contributes, livestock and fisheries account for 31%, crop production for 27%, land use for 24%, and the supply chain for 18% ( 2 ). Considering that different agricultural products contribute varying amounts of greenhouse gases, your food choices can greatly affect your carbon footprint, which is the total amount of greenhouse gases caused by an individual. Keep reading to find out some ways in which you can reduce your carbon footprint while still enjoying many of the foods you love. While water may seem like an infinite resource for most of us, many areas of the world experience water scarcity. Agriculture is responsible for about 70% of freshwater use worldwide ( 12 ). That said, different agricultural products use varying amounts of water during their production. The most water-intensive products to produce are cheese, nuts, farmed fish and prawns, followed by dairy cows ( 2 ). Thus, more sustainable agricultural practices present a great opportunity to control water use. Some examples of this include the use of drip irrigation over sprinklers, capturing rainwater to water crops, and growing drought-tolerant crops. The last major impact of traditional food production I want to mention is fertilizer runoff, also referred to as eutrophication. When crops are fertilized, there’s potential for excess nutrients to enter the surrounding environment and waterways, which in turn can disrupt natural ecosystems. You may think that organic farming could be a solution to this, but that’s not necessarily the case ( 13 ). While organic farming methods must be free of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides , they’re not totally chemical-free. Thus, switching to organic products doesn’t entirely solve the issues of runoff. That said, organic products have been shown to have less pesticide residue than their conventionally farmed counterparts ( 14 ). While you can’t directly change fertilizer practices of farms as a consumer, you can advocate for more environmentally friendly options, such as the use of cover crops and planting trees to manage runoff. With the production of food for human consumption comes a variety of environmental impacts. The main modifiable impacts of food production include land use, greenhouse gases, water use, and fertilizer runoff. Here are some ways in which you can eat more sustainably, including when it comes to meat consumption. When it comes to reducing your carbon footprint , eating local is a common recommendation. While eating local seems to make sense intuitively, it doesn’t appear to have as much of an impact on sustainability for most foods as you would expect — though it may offer other benefits. Recent data shows that what you eat is much more important than where it comes from, as transportation only makes up a small amount of a food’s overall greenhouse gas emissions ( 15 ). This means that choosing a lower emission food, such as poultry, over a much higher emission food, such as beef, has a bigger impact — regardless of where the foods have traveled from. That being said, one category in which eating local may reduce your carbon footprint is with highly perishable foods, which need to be quickly transported due to their short shelf lives. Oftentimes, these foods are air-freighted, significantly increasing their overall emissions by up to 50 times more than transportation by sea ( 2 ). These mainly include fresh fruits and vegetables, such as asparagus, green beans, berries, and pineapples. It’s important to note that only a very small amount of the food supply travels by air — most are transported via large ships or on trucks overland. That said, eating local may have other benefits, such as supporting local producers using more sustainable farming practices, eating with the seasons, knowing exactly where your food is coming from, and how it was produced. Protein-rich foods, such as meats, dairy, and eggs, make up about 83% of our dietary emissions ( 16 ). In terms of overall carbon footprint, beef and lamb are highest on the list. This is due to their extensive land use, feeding requirements, processing, and packaging. In addition, cows produce methane in their guts during the digestion process, further contributing to their carbon footprint. While red meats produce about 60 kg of CO2 equivalents per kg of meat — a common measure of greenhouse gas emissions — other foods make up significantly less ( 2 ). For example, poultry farming produces 6 kg, fish 5 kg, and eggs 4.5 kg of CO2 equivalents per kg of meat. As a comparison, that’s 132 pounds, 13 pounds, 11 pounds, and 10 pounds of CO2 equivalents per pound of meat for red meats, poultry, fish, and eggs, respectively. Therefore, eating less red meat can significantly decrease your carbon footprint. Buying grass-fed red meat from sustainable local producers may slightly decrease greenhouse gas emissions, but the data shows that decreasing red meat consumption, in general, has more of an impact ( 17 ). Another impactful way to promote being an ethical omnivore is by eating more plant-based protein sources . Foods like tofu, beans, peas, quinoa, hemp seeds, and nuts have a significantly lower carbon footprint when compared with most animal proteins ( 2 ). While the nutritional content of these plant proteins can differ greatly when compared with animal proteins, protein content can be matched with the appropriate portion sizes. Including more plant-based protein sources in your diet doesn’t mean you have to totally eliminate animal foods. One way to reduce how much animal protein you eat is by subbing out one-half of the protein in a recipe with a plant-based one. For example, when making a traditional chili recipe, swap out half of the minced meat for tofu crumbles. This way you’ll get the flavor of the meat, but you have reduced the amount of animal protein, in turn reducing the carbon footprint of that given meal. The last aspect of becoming an ethical omnivore I want to discuss is reducing food waste. Globally, food waste accounts for 6% of greenhouse gas production ( 2 , 18 , 19 ). While this also takes into account losses throughout the supply chain from poor storage and handling, a lot of this is food throw away by retailers and consumers. Some practical ways for you to reduce food waste are: Another added benefit of reducing food waste is that it can also save you a lot of money on groceries. Try implementing some of the methods above to start reducing food waste and your carbon footprint. Though emissions from food production can’t be eliminated, there are numerous ways to cut down on them. The most impactful ways to do this include moderating red meat consumption, eating more plant-based proteins, and reducing food waste. Food production is responsible for a significant amount of global emissions through land use, greenhouse gases, water use, and fertilizer runoff. While we can’t avoid this altogether, eating more ethically can greatly reduce your carbon footprint. The main ways to do so include moderating red meat consumption, eating more plant-based proteins, and reducing food waste. Being conscious of your decisions surrounding food can go a long way toward furthering a sustainable food environment for years to come.

We’re all feeling the effects of inflation right now and it’s certainly noticeable at the grocery store. Grocery prices are up about 12% from last year and certain categories are up even more. We’re seeing significantly higher prices on staple foods like eggs , beef , and milk . Those dollars add up, even for the savviest shopper. A 12% increase in prices means that if your grocery budget is typically $500, it’s now stretched to $560. However, there are ways to help spend less on groceries and still put nutritious meals on the table. Try some of these tips to cut back on costs at the grocery store when inflation is driving prices up. This is hard to quantify, but planning helps save you money for many reasons. Making a grocery list helps you avoid impulse purchases that add up. You’re more likely to use what you buy and what you already have on hand — which helps cut back on costs more. Researchers estimate that, on average, households throw away about 30% of the food they buy. Having a dinner plan (plus a few lunches and breakfasts) for the week also helps you cook more at home and pass up takeout or other more expensive options on busy days. It doesn’t have to be complex, but having a few recipes written down and then shopping for those ingredients is a great strategy to help you save money at the store. As a dietitian, I always advocate for people to eat more fruits and vegetables . Those foods may seem expensive, but there are ways to stretch your dollar and still get your fill of the nutrition that produce provides. Choosing frozen , canned or dried fruits and vegetables is a great way to save money and still get vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants into your diet. Look for options that are lower in added sugars and salt. Consider swapping out a more expensive fruit or vegetable with something cheaper . Turn cabbage into a slaw, instead of a mixed green salad to save. Use onions instead of shallots in a soup recipe, or try frozen berries instead of fresh in a smoothie. Also, make sure you actually eat what you buy. That’s another reason frozen and canned produce are great staples, but use up your delicate produce first, so you don’t end up throwing money away. You can also try freezing produce or adding anything that’s about to go bad to soups, fried rice, or eggs. Some of us are already adept at using coupons and looking through the weekly sale flyers. But if you don’t currently, it’s not too late to start. Most grocery stores offer discounts throughout the store. Combine those with coupons, and you could save quite a bit. If you shop online — using a grocery delivery or pickup service — try adding virtual coupons to your order or filtering products by what’s on sale. If there is a grocery store you go to often, make sure you’re signed up for their rewards points. My favorite strategy is to look at what’s on sale first, then add some of those foods into my meal plan for the week. This way, I’m not adding lots of extra foods just because they’re on sale. I also check for coupons for foods I usually buy. If you don’t know what a unit price is, you should. It’s located on the shelf next to the price for the item and allows you to better compare sizes and different brands. Let’s say you go through cereal every week. It might make sense to buy the bigger box, which will cost more at the time but is going to be cheaper per pound than the smaller box. Unit prices show you the cost based on weight, and smaller sizes cost more. Scanning unit pricing can also help you compare different brands that may offer their food products in different size packages and find the one that makes the most sense for your budget. Protein-rich foods like meat, poultry and seafood tend to be some of the more expensive foods on our plates. There are ways to see some smart savings here without giving up meat (if you don’t want to!). It’s true that many plant-based proteins , like beans and tofu, are cheaper than meat. Trying a meatless meal or two might help you save some money. Choosing less expensive cuts of meat helps too. Choosing ground meats, top round steaks, or chicken thighs (vs. breasts) are ways to help cut costs. Talk to your butcher or compare prices to save. Since protein is pricey, if you have the freezer space, it may make sense to stock up when it’s on sale. Then just freeze, and thaw when you’re ready to cook. You can also stretch your meat by blending it with veggies and grains in meals like stir-frys, burgers or casseroles. With proteins, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing, but rather little things can help you save over time. My grandmother, who grew up during the great depression, almost never threw away food. I once tried to get rid of yogurt I thought had expired, and she quickly corrected me and stuck it back in the fridge. Sometimes, food does grow mold or turn rancid — and then please don’t eat it! But the dates you see on food packages often represent quality standards, not safety. Other than infant formula, which does get a safety date, foods are listed with “best if used by,” “sell-by,” “use-by,” or “freeze-by” dates that indicate freshness and quality, per the USDA . Check those dates, both at the store and at your house, to ensure what you’re buying is fresh and that you’re using up older products first. Paying attention to dates can help save you money since you’re eating up food when it’s freshest. You don’t need to treat those dates as hard and fast rules to throw away food though. Sometimes when it seems like there isn’t anything to eat in the house, there is. Turning to what you have before you make a list and shop can help you save money, since you’re using what you’ve got. It might take a little more effort — maybe you’re not really sure what to make with that box of pasta , or you’ve had a bag of broccoli languishing in your freezer — but using these building blocks to tackle one meal can help keep costs down. Taking inventory also helps you use up foods before they do spoil. Buying more of everything isn’t the smartest choice — and means you’re spending a lot of money upfront on groceries. Big box stores , like Costco, Sam’s Club and BJ’s, offer great deals on groceries. They can be especially helpful for large families who need to stock up on a lot of food. Even if you’re not cooking for a crowd, you may find that it makes sense to buy certain staple foods in bulk because of the significant cost savings. If you don’t have a membership to a warehouse store or a lot of space to store extra food at home, just buying larger sizes (check those unit prices!) at your regular store can help you save. Many of us are loyal to our grocery store, but switching it up can help you save on your grocery bill. Depending on sales, you may want to mix up where you shop. Plus, some grocery stores just have certain foods for less and not just big box stores. Stores like ALDI and Trader Joe’s have developed loyal followings for offering great prices on their items. Even dollar stores will have some grocery staples for great prices. Not everyone has the ability to shop at different stores – due to where they live and how easy it is to access food —but if you can mix up where you shop, you may be able to save some money. It’s true that a lot of times we pay a premium for convenience — think pre-cut produce or sauces that are already made and ready for you to use. However, sometimes those convenience items pay off, and it means you’re eating a home-cooked meal instead of again getting takeout or letting items in your fridge go to waste. We all need a little help putting dinner on the table, so choose your convenience wisely and make sure you are getting what you pay for. Sometimes the cost of chopped veggies or a jarred sauce is not that much more expensive. Be mindful of the prices to see what the premium is and also know that you can find convenience without paying more by buying items like frozen vegetables. You might need a little help from the store but make sure you’re choosing that convenience wisely and using it to your advantage to save money in the long run by cooking more at home.

Between wrapping up Veganuary and celebrating Black History Month, I’ve reflected on my nearly 3-year anniversary of being vegan and how it has intersected with Black culture. Because I grew up in a Jamaican-Trini household, meat-centric dishes were the norm for the entirety of my life prior to moving out. One of my best memories as a child was waiting for Mom’s weekly dish of curry chicken with chickpeas, potatoes, and rice. At the time, I was unaware of how veganism could be culturally influenced by and incorporate dishes from a Jamaican Rastafarian Ital diet , a primarily vegetarian diet whose name is derived from “vital foods.” Shifting my perception of vegan food and seeing where it fit into my culture led to my discoveries that seasonings hold a high purpose in every meal and that it’s unnecessary for every dish to mimic the taste and texture of meat. As I began filling my pantry with staples like grains, legumes, and beans, I was encouraged to incorporate dishes such as a chickpea-based curry or Jamaican “beef” patty inspired by my mom’s cooking into my new lifestyle. Of course, this resulted in a lot of failures, attempts to settle for simpler dishes, and the all-too-familiar path of settling for meat alternatives from Gardein or Beyond Meat . I felt as if I’d leaped into this diet without a proper understanding of nutrition. Plus, I was concerned about upholding my status as a foodie. “Is it really possible to enjoy a vegan diet?” I asked myself. It’s a blur as to when I exactly got it, but by the time I moved away from home and headed to college, I somewhat knew what I was doing. It seems as if every vegan I’ve spoken to eventually learns that they have a favorite dairy-free cheese brand, along with a preference for either Beyond Meat or Impossible Meat. And, of course, every vegan or vegetarian has their preferred nondairy milk — and yes, mine is oat . In addition to finding my favorite foods, I quickly learned that I had to begin curating a specific feed on my social media that centered on Black and Caribbean vegans to reassure myself that I’m still able to be a foodie and actually enjoy every meal that I make. Whether it was a YouTuber like Rachel Ama or TikTok’s sweetheart Tabitha Brown , every time I was able to re-create a recipe inspired by a Black vegan foodie, I felt at ease. Reading essays on Black veganism and activism in “ Aphro-ism: Essays on Pop Culture, Feminism, and Black Veganism from Two Sisters ” by Aph Ko and Syl Ko also helped me with thinking critically as a Black vegan and with decolonizing my diet. Along with my Caribbean background, I’ve lived in the South for my entire life, so soul food and Cajun food have influenced a lot of my dishes. Your cultural identity is reflected in your culinary skills, so I desired vegan soul food and Jamaican curry to connect with my culture beyond the traditional curry chicken, curry goat , and oxtail. Being raised in a town with an abundance of seafood and soul food meant weekly trips to the fish market and an unexplainable love for collard greens and macaroni and cheese. Assuming that I would have to leave these adored meals behind for my new vegan diet was heartbreaking — until I came to the quick realization that it is possible to craft and perfect recipes that incorporate vegan products while infusing a little bit of home. Once I started to accept the differences in the taste and texture of my meals, I began to stop questioning the reasons behind my veganism. However, other people’s inquiries surrounding my newfound lifestyle didn’t cease. While attending barbecues and family dinners, I was questioned about cutting meat and dairy out of my life and dreaded the alienating experience of being the only vegan in the family. Choosing to cook myself an entire meal prior to attending a family gathering can be exhausting, and I often felt like I was rebuking my culture. The intersection of being Southern and Caribbean often means meat-based meals or dishes that include pieces of meat, like collard greens or steamed cabbage. But most of these meals can easily be made vegan-friendly, so I learned not to feel ashamed of removing meat and keeping some familiar parts of my beloved dishes. I can’t fault people for being inquisitive about my going vegan, because I became a different person in many ways after removing meat from my diet. Prior to veganism, for example, I wasn’t aware of the harms of factory farms and the environmental impact of eating animals . I didn’t engage in environmental activism the way I do today. When people ask about the benefits of going plant-based, I always refer to the effects that the lifestyle change has had on my life over the last 3 years in terms of my environmental footprint. Environmental justice is intersectional with veganism, which is intersectional with — you guessed it — race. We can see these relationships at work in many conversations. For example, Black people are more likely to be diagnosed with heart disease , and the fight to end animal exploitation often overshadows discrimination within the vegan community. These conversations always lead me to the same conclusion: There’s a pipeline from beginner vegan to environmental justice advocate. But this pipeline often isn’t recognized by white vegans, who are more likely to value animal rights over the lives of Latinx farmworkers struggling for fair wages or Black people suffering from food apartheid. Subsequently, investigating this leads to the not-so-shocking discovery that these unfazed white vegans usually support People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an organization that has come under fire for speciesism and racism on many occasions. In my eyes, most white vegans seem more concerned with the aesthetics or individual health benefits of going vegan and don’t engage deeply with the social and political aspects of what we eat, where our food comes from, and what injustices exist in our food systems . But as a Vegan of Color, I see that identity, culture, food access, and environmental justice are linked. I’ve lived in Tallahassee, Florida, for nearly 3 years and attend Florida A&M University, a historically Black university located within a food desert and food swamp. The terms “food desert” and “food swamp” refer to areas in which access to fresh, health-promoting food is limited. In a food desert , fresh foods are prohibitively expensive or inaccessible due to factors such as limited grocery stores and lack of access to reliable transportation. A food swamp is a place where fast-food restaurants and convenience stores are more reliable sources of food than grocery stores or farmers markets. Most often, food deserts and swamps affect Communities of Color. That’s why many food justice scholars use the term “ food apartheid ” to describe these situations (and other failures of our food system) instead. While real deserts and swamps are natural and important to the environment, racialized disparities in food access are not — and they’re constructed by racist politics. It’s a shame our students and nearby residents are suffering from the lack of access to health-promoting foods, while this city can offer healthier choices and walkable access to organic grocery stores for the predominately white institution — Florida State University — next door. The fact that racialized food access is a common problem in so many cities didn’t come to my attention until after I adopted a plant-based diet and realized that veganism can be so inaccessible in many communities. I had the honor of speaking with Isaias Hernandez, known in the environmental justice space as @queerbrownvegan . Hernandez said that white vegans often don’t acknowledge how colonization has distorted mainstream views on veganism. “I think that there are people who directly are focused on animal liberation and also advocate for human rights,” he said. But “they are not able to address… the reasons why they’re trying to abolish these existing industries is because the industries exist today because of colonialism and global capitalism. “One example of that is looking directly into factory farms as the development of industrial agriculture itself, the privatization of seeds, the privatization of land, who grew that land — racial capitalism plays a huge role in people not understanding shifting to plant-based systems.” And in a VICE article from 2020, writer Anya Zoledziowski highlighted the whitewashing of veganism — specifically the “newfound” obsession over avocados and quinoa, which have been staples in the households of People of Color for millennia. As Zoledziowski mentions, it seems as if a racial reckoning was necessary for white vegans to acknowledge the existence of Vegans of Color. In the summer of 2020, after George Floyd’s murder, a sea of pastel infographics haunted Instagram, sharing the usernames of nonwhite vegan chefs and influencers. It felt like a long-awaited method of including us in the conversation — a conversation we should have been a part of from the beginning. The experience of being vegan while Black is not a monolithic one. Black veganism can be many things. It can be lining up for hours in Atlanta’s scorching heat for a taste of Pinky Cole’s Slutty Vegan burgers. It can also be advocating for food and environmental justice and healthier options in lower income communities. And at the same time, it can be educating my carnivorous family on the benefits of opting into a Meatless Monday. Because Black people are the fastest-growing vegan demographic in America , it feels like sharing my adoration for veganism and passion for environmental justice is time well spent. Mine isn’t a unique experience — it’s shared by many Black vegans. These reflections on the racialized politics of veganism — and, more broadly, of food access — seem vital for others who are wondering where to go next in their plant-based chapter.

Connect with us for all things health. “Food freedom” — it’s a complex term, with definitions ranging from ditching diet culture and restrictive diets to attaining good health and food security through growing your own foods. It’s marketed as an approach to address eating disorders for some and as a way to promote intentional weight loss for others. However, in the health and wellness space, it’s an emerging, revolutionary concept that challenges societal norms of dieting and the thin ideal. It is championed by passionate health professionals and game-changers, such as Shana Spence (@thenutritiontea). Spence is a registered dietitian who takes a non-diet, weight-inclusive approach to health. She uses her platform to redefine what “health” means — distinct from the diet industry’s often-unattainable standards. Another powerful and passionate food freedom champion is Dr. Kera Nyemb-Diop (@black.nutritionist), who has created a space that emphasizes body respect, eating without guilt, and reclaiming your cultural food heritage as an integral part of your healthy lifestyle. In this article, we explore food freedom, explain what intuitive eating and mindful eating are, and discuss what roles — if any — they may have in the pursuit of intentional weight loss. The food freedom framework has various definitions and applications, including but not limited to ( 1 , 2 ): In other contexts, food freedom refers to ditching dieting culture and restrictive diets by giving yourself permission to enjoy all foods in moderation (unless allergies or medical needs prevent you from eating certain foods). In that application of food freedom, practitioners see food as more than just fuel. They seek to build a positive and judgment-free relationship with all foods, where guilt is not considered an ingredient in the eating experience. This view of food freedom encompasses intuitive eating and mindful eating, two philosophies that cultivate self-trust around food choices and reject unnecessary restrictions. Intuitive eating and mindful eating are often used to support recovery from eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, chronic mental illnesses that negatively affect nutritional status and your relationship with food ( 3 , 4 , 5 ). Overall, food freedom can help people overcome diet culture or introduce flexibility for intentional weight loss. Because the varied and overlapping marketing of the term “food freedom” may lead to some confusion, context matters. This article will focus on food freedom as a non-diet approach to health and nutrition. Disordered eating and eating disorders can affect anyone, regardless of gender identity, race, age, socioeconomic status, or other identities. They can be caused by any combination of biological, social, cultural, and environmental factors — not just by exposure to diet culture. If you feel like you may be overly concerned with your weight or preoccupied with food, or if you get overwhelmed when you think about maintaining a healthful, guilt-free eating pattern, feel empowered to talk with a qualified healthcare professional. A registered dietitian or therapist can help you work through feelings of guilt or anxiety and build eating patterns that support your health, both physical and mental. You can also chat, call, or text anonymously with trained volunteers at the National Eating Disorders Association helpline for free, or explore the organization’s free and low cost resources. The term “food freedom” has various definitions, including ditching diet culture and cultivating self-trust around food choices. The food freedom approach has been used to support both eating disorder recovery and some intentional weight loss programs. Food freedom as a therapeutic approach for eating disorder recovery grew out of the need for non-pharmaceutical treatments that emphasize behavioral changes, such as a positive body image and healthy eating attitudes ( 3 , 6 ). A 2017 study demonstrated that dieting — accompanied by body dissatisfaction and the pursuit of thinness — increases the risk of developing bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and purging disorder ( 7 ). Even dieting among inherently lean individuals increases their risk of developing anorexia nervosa ( 7 ). The multibillion-dollar diet industry promotes the “thin ideal” with unhealthy weight management behaviors, potentially encouraging disordered eating patterns that can contribute to the development of eating disorders ( 7 , 8 ). There’s evidence that dieting doesn’t help those who are seeking long-term weight loss, either. Weight regain within 1–5 years is common among chronic dieters, and approximately 33% of dieters regain more weight than they initially lost ( 8 ). Dieting restrictions contribute to disordered eating. Food freedom, on the other hand, seeks to combat this ( 5 ). Food freedom as a mindfulness-based practice may address disordered eating, including emotional eating and binge eating disorder . It can also help you avoid eating in response to external cues, such as the sight or smell of foods, when you’re not physically hungry ( 6 , 9 ). In particular, intuitive eating is associated with improved psychological well-being and physical health and fewer dietary restrictions ( 5 , 10 ). Food freedom arose from the need for behavior-change approaches emphasizing positive body image and healthy eating attitudes instead of dieting restrictions. It can support folks in recovery from disordered eating or clinical eating disorders. Although these three terms are often used interchangeably, you may wonder whether they are essentially the same. There are minor distinctions among their presiding principles. For instance, mindful eating is rooted in the Buddhist practice of mindfulness and living with awareness and intention ( 11 , 12 ). It’s a meditative practice that is built on the mind-body connection and fosters a state of nonjudgmental awareness that engages your senses — sight, smell, taste, and feel — during a meal ( 11 , 12 ). Mindful eating is the art of being present while you eat. Similarly, intuitive eating nurtures a mind-body connection, but it’s distinctively rooted in a weight-inclusive approach to health and serves as the core of the Health at Every Size paradigm ( 10 ). Intuitive eating is guided by 10 principles, including respecting your body, rejecting diet culture, making peace with food, and honoring health through gentle nutrition. Food freedom , however, isn’t so well defined. It may represent true forms of intuitive eating or mindful eating, or it may attempt to bridge gaps between intentional weight loss, caloric restriction, and increased flexibility with food. Despite these differences, there is a common thread among the three terms: They all seek to reduce unnecessary dietary restrictions and improve your relationship with food . They aim to remove prospects of guilt, shame, and negative emotions associated with consuming “forbidden” or “bad” foods. The terms “food freedom,” “intuitive eating,” and “mindful eating” may be used interchangeably, but there are differences among these practices. However, they all seek to reduce dieting restrictions and increase flexibility. Food freedom, when used as a non-diet approach to health, seeks to liberate you from the thin ideal and diet culture , unsafe weight loss or weight management behaviors, and yo-yo dieting. Whether you choose to adopt a meditative approach with mindful eating or work through the 10 principles of intuitive eating, freedom from restriction and judgment is possible. Here are some tips: Food freedom as a non-diet approach to nutrition includes tuning in to your internal cues of fullness and hunger, removing morality from foods, and focusing on health-promoting behaviors rather than the scale. Intentional weight loss is the active attempt to change your body weight, with the goal of lowering the number on the scale. Although studies show that intuitive eating is associated with weight loss and a lower body mass index (BMI) , at its core, intuitive eating is not a weight loss method ( 10 ). A true intuitive eating program would not advertise weight loss as an outcome, since some people may lose weight while others may gain or maintain weight. Intuitive eating allows your body to find its “happy weight,” or biologically determined set point weight. Likewise, the fundamental principles of mindful eating are not focused on weight loss — though some weight loss programs have co-opted its messages of mindfulness ( 11 ). Other programs work to bridge the gap by focusing on health-promoting habits while instituting small calorie deficits that promote slow-paced weight loss without completely avoiding pleasurable foods that might not be nutrient-dense or low in calories. The principles of intuitive eating and mindful eating don’t focus on intentional weight loss, although weight loss, gain, or maintenance may occur when you adopt them. Instead, they focus on allowing your body to reach its “happy,” natural weight. “Food freedom” is a highly marketed term with various definitions, ranging from overcoming diet culture and restrictive diets to engaging in food sovereignty . Therefore, context matters. As a non-diet approach to nutrition, food freedom includes tuning in to your internal cues of fullness and hunger, decoupling foods and morality, and focusing on health-promoting behaviors — not just the scale. At their core, intuitive eating and mindful eating principles don’t focus on or promote intentional weight loss. Rather, they help you discover and engage in health-promoting habits that may lead to weight loss, gain, or maintenance. These frameworks help people foster positive relationships with foods and their bodies that are built on self-trust and self-compassion rather than on the thin ideal . Try this today: At your next meal, try removing distractions, such as the TV or your phone. Chew your food thoroughly (at least 20 times) to engage your senses and connect with your internal fullness cues.

Here’s our process Vitamin D is essential for bone health, muscle growth and development, and more. If you’re not getting enough of this nutrient from sun exposure, vitamin D supplements may help. Check out our picks. If you’ve discovered you have a vitamin D deficiency , you’re not alone. It’s particularly common among: Breastfed infants and children with certain medical conditions are also susceptible to vitamin D deficiency. If a healthcare professional has recommended a vitamin D supplement for calcium absorption, bone health, or muscle growth and development, we’ve vetted and narrowed down our recommendations to eight supplements for when vitamin D from sun exposure is not enough or inaccessible. Our Medical Standards and Insights team has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We fact-check health claims, evaluate ingredients, and look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline. To choose the products on this page, we considered all the vitamin D supplements that passed our vetting process. Then, we personally tested some of them to narrow down our list even further. Vitamin D is not common in food Sun exposure is the main source of vitamin D. There are two forms of vitamin D Vitamin D2 is found in plants, and vitamin D3 is found in animal-sourced food, like fish oil. Many benefits of vitamin D It helps with calcium absorption, bone health, immune function, and disease prevention. Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that plays a key role in many aspects of health . Because vitamin D is found naturally in very few food sources and is mostly obtained through sun exposure, many people have an increased risk of deficiency. Vitamin D supplements can help ensure that you’re getting the amount of vitamin D you need . They come in two forms: vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 . While both forms can increase blood levels of vitamin D, vitamin D3 can raise vitamin D levels higher and for longer than vitamin D2. Before you decide on a vitamin D supplement, getting your nutrient levels checked is wise. A blood test is the only way to find out whether you are deficient, insufficient, sufficient, or optimal in any nutrient. A healthcare professional can order blood work and help you determine an appropriate dosage if a supplement is necessary for you. At-home testing kits may also be useful to measure your vitamin D levels. Certain medications may interfere with the absorption of vitamin D or calcium, including : In turn, vitamin D may reduce the potency of other medications, such as statins . It’s wise to speak with a doctor about any contraindications. If you get a solid amount of vitamin D and supplement with vitamin D you may be at risk for vitamin D toxicity or vitamin D overdose. The main side effect of vitamin D toxicity is a surplus of calcium in the bloodstream ( hypercalcemia ). Contact a doctor if you experience the following symptoms while supplementing with vitamin D: Research shows that vitamin D3 is more effective than vitamin D2 at increasing blood levels of vitamin D. A 2020 study also found that both liquid and capsule vitamin D3 supplements can raise vitamin D levels efficiently. Vitamin D3 is typically better absorbed and used by the body than vitamin D2. Keep in mind, vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, so it requires dietary fat in order to be full absorbed. It’s a good idea to take your vitamin D with a meal containing healthy fats. The best strength of vitamin D can vary based on individual needs and levels, and it’s possible to overdo it . Be sure to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized dosage recommendations. The products above are among the best vitamin D supplements on the market and suit a wide variety of needs. Just keep in mind that for optimal absorption, it’s best to take vitamin D supplements with a meal containing fat, such as olive oil or peanut butter.

Somehow, trips to the grocery store have become complicated. Even if you find every ingredient on your list, do you feel confident about what it does or doesn’t do for your body? With buzzwords like “adaptogens” and more sources of antioxidants and protein than you ever knew existed floating around, it can be hard to keep it all straight.

At Healthline Nutrition, we want to help you eat food that makes you feel good. Looking at science is always where we start, but we understand that real-life eating doesn’t fit some perfect nutrient pattern. Here’s how you can refresh your eating habits while still enjoying your meals. Almost every January, without fail, people become interested in nutrition, health, and wellness. There are countless resolutions around weight loss, specific eating patterns, fitness goals, and more. While I love to see the enthusiasm around taking better care of yourself, all too often, it starts with eliminating countless foods and hitting the gym 7 days a week. The lofty start may sound great but tends to fizzle out after a couple of weeks. Instead of banishing sugar, carbs, or bread — what if you focused on small, positive changes you could make? Swaps that may not feel as significant but are much more likely to be sustainable. It’s estimated that only about 9% of people stick to their resolutions every year. Why not try a healthy refresh instead? It’s not as exciting, but getting back to basics is important. If you’re feeling confused about where to start, you’re not alone. Almost everyone has an opinion about nutrition, and it’s not always — err, rarely — based in evidence. On social media, it can be overwhelming to sift through nutrition information and figure out what’s true and what makes sense for you. I encourage you to start with what the science says and also start small. New research was just published, showing how important hydration is for healthy aging, so drink more water (perhaps a new water bottle will help motivate you). We know that sleep is important for overall health and impacts your appetite and food cravings (try these science-based tips for better sleep ). Almost 90% of us aren’t eating the recommended amount of fruits and vegetables, but we have some creative and simple ways to help you get your fill . If you’re already checking those boxes, and getting some movement in, good for you. Think about other small ways to refresh your eating habits. Maybe you make it a goal to try one new food a week, eat protein-rich foods at most meals and snacks, cook more at home, or meal prep on Sundays. Notice how most of the small changes I mention are positive. They’re foods or habits you can add to your day. I don’t like restriction or deprivation, but I believe that adding some good stuff can naturally help crowd out other behaviors. Often nutrition and healthy eating is presented like an $80 smoothie full of potions, powders, and tinctures. In reality, you could whip up a smoothie with some frozen fruits and veggies for a fraction of the price that will still be very good for you. In addition to being budget-friendly, healthy food should taste good. Only 29% of Healthline readers said they thought healthy food tastes good, which means that most people equate healthy food with tasting bad. This is one myth I hope we can banish together. Not everything needs to be the most amazing meal of your life, but have you ever tried a roasted Brussels sprout? They’re light years away in flavor from any steamed or boiled sprouts you may remember as a kid. If cooking feels overwhelming, these 10 simple dinner recipes can help you put tasty and easy meals on the table. Or try a healthy meal delivery service to make dinner even easier. Healthy eating should incorporate foods that you love, that you grew up with, and that are part of your culture. Nutrition is one piece of a complex puzzle when it comes to your health. Even though good nutrition is key, it’s not the only thing that matters. When it comes to a healthy refresh, some of the changes will happen on your plate, and some of them will happen outside of nutrition. General wellness behaviors like getting more sleep, moving your body more and taking care of your mental well-being . Far too often, I see people feel ashamed for eating a brownie or french fries, or making a food choice that they have deemed to be “bad.” Try and let go of guilt around food and treat yourself with kindness this year. On days I’m reaching for more processed food than usual, it probably means I was busy making good memories. Instead of getting down on myself, I let it go and trust that my next few meals will be a bit more nutrient-dense. At Healthline we’ll teach you about optimal nutrition and empower you to take that information and apply it to figure out what works for you. Sometimes that’s going to be high-protein salads and sometimes it’s going to be enjoying cookies guilt-free. I’m rooting for you to give up the goal of dietary perfection and instead to embrace what comes along with eating foods that make you feel good. I hope when you come to Healthline nutrition, it feels like you’re sitting down for a cozy, comforting, and balanced meal with a friend who happens to know a lot about nutrition science.

    "text": "Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process The options when it comes to vitamin brands can be overwhelming, to say the least. Vitamin subscription services take the guesswork out of vitamin purchases by offering more personalized suggestions — and even custom blends — based on questionnaires or blood testing. These companies also automatically ship monthly refills so you never run out. Some even package your daily vitamins in individual envelopes, making grabbing your day’s supply easy without opening multiple vitamin bottles. Healthline’s dietitians looked at a dozen of the most popular personalized vitamin services on the market and tried the products themselves. These five services ultimately passed our dietitians’ review and our internal vetting process. Disclaimer: Some products below were provided to Healthline testers for free. However, our reviews are ours and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by the supplement manufacturers. Know that a personalized vitamin service isn’t always appropriate, and most people do not need to take multiple supplements, especially if you eat a well-rounded diet. Unless you have a need you’ve discussed with your dietitian or other trusted healthcare professional, you might consider something more straightforward. Check out our other picks for best vitamin brands . Here’s a quick look at how our top picks compare: We determined the best personalized vitamins and vitamin subscription services using the following criteria: Most of the services above require you to sign up for recurring monthly shipments, and each product typically contains 30 servings. Therefore, the monthly cost of a service depends on the product(s) you select and the total number of products you choose to receive each month. Unlike many other subscription services, vitamin subscriptions generally do not charge separate membership or subscription fees. When choosing a vitamin subscription service, there are several factors to consider, such as the type of personalization offered, access to health professionals, cost, and brand reputation. If you’d rather pick and choose the supplements you want, a service such as HUM may work best. If you want personalization plus the added bonus of individual daily packets, then a service such as Perelel offers both. Several companies, including HUM and Persona, offer access to health professionals, such as nutritionists or dietitians , for questions and supplement guidance. Kristin loved this aspect of obtaining vitamins from Persona. “I had an interesting circumstance. I called customer service because my cart, chock-full of my supplement recommendations based on my quiz, had timed out after too many days open. When I redid the quiz with a new email address, I answered the same questions but got a slightly different recommended bundle. “Well, after calling and clicking through just a couple of prompts, I received a live person in the U.S., and what’s more, it was a nutritionist right off the bat — and even one of the founders! I was very impressed with the access to such expertise. “She helped me to understand that I added a couple more medications I forgot to add the first time I did the quiz, and Persona is very careful to not recommend products if there is even a chance of contraindication.” Vitamin subscription services can cost $25 to $100 or more monthly. Finally, ensure that your vitamin subscription service is reputable and transparent. This means the company’s products are manufactured in facilities that adhere to the CGMPs. Because the FDA doesn’t regulate dietary supplements the same way it does pharmaceuticals, it’s also a wise idea to choose third-party tested supplements to verify that the contents of the bottle match what is listed on the label. Whether a personalized vitamin service is worth it depends on the service and whether you value its convenience. These services can be particularly beneficial for people who are unsure which supplements to take and who regularly forget to reorder them. Some services offer additional features, such as access to a dietitian, that may make them worth a slightly higher cost. Research from 2024 looked at personalized nutrition approaches. It suggests that personalized nutrition advice based on current lifestyle, biological characteristics, and more, may be superior to generalized or standardized nutrition advice in helping improve diet quality and metabolic health. However, more research is needed. Plus, these services are typically more expensive than buying supplements from a local or online pharmacy. Additionally, the health quizzes that many personalized vitamin companies use are not a substitute for a thorough medical review by a healthcare professional. Personalized vitamin quizzes may recommend more supplements than you need. Before clicking the subscribe button, it’s best to share your supplement recommendations with a trusted healthcare professional, such as a doctor or dietitian. Our tester Kristin Currin spoke to Karina C , a founding Persona nutritionist, BSN. Karina pointed out that she’s glad to see “more and more MDs and health coaches are recommending supplements.” She says Persona health professionals can and do even conduct what’s called “peer-to-peer” with customers’ personal physicians, and “we can build out personalized bundles with physician guidance.” Karina says with Persona Nutrition supplements, “every ingredient has a recommended limit for customers that can be overridden and replaced with a Persona max limit with practitioner guidance.” According to Karina, this kind of individualized and collaborative supplementation is becoming the norm and lends to more preventive rather than exclusively retroactive healthcare. She says that more than the old way of just diagnosing and prescribing, “we’re validating folks’ lived experiences. Many of my 20-minute phone consultations with customers end up talking about them as a whole. It ends up being about sleep just as much as health. Finding your community.” Kristin and Karina observed that what used to be referred to as “bartender therapy” or “barbershop therapy” is now falling into the ready and listening ears of nutritionists and teletherapy clinicians. All of the subscription services above offer personalized vitamins and customized supplement recommendations based on the results of a health screening or questionnaire. But companies may not disclose these products’ exact ingredients or amounts. So, you should be especially careful when choosing reputable companies to buy personalized vitamins. The brands above are all very transparent about their supplements and ingredients. While they may offer individualized recommendations and personal vitamin packs, their supplements disclose ingredients and vital information. Personalized vitamins can cost $25 to $100 or more monthly, depending on the brand, type of customization, and whether you subscribe. For example, Vous Vitamins works a bit differently than other custom vitamin services and builds one tailored multivitamins versus a vitamin pack with multiple capsules. This costs $30 a month, billed every 3 months, if you subscribe. Most people don’t need a comprehensive, personalized vitamin regimen. It can be beneficial if you’re looking to fill gaps in your diet or have specific issues you’re hoping to address, such as low energy or trouble sleeping . However, it’s important to discuss these issues with a trusted, qualified healthcare professional to make sure there’s not a different underlying cause for your symptoms.  Most people can meet their nutritional needs by following a healthy diet .  However, vitamins can be beneficial in some cases, especially for people with certain health conditions or restrictive diets.  A doctor or dietitian can help determine whether you may benefit from adding vitamins or other supplements to your routine.  Personalized supplements provide the same vitamins and minerals as regular supplements and are generally safe for most healthy adults when used as directed. However, mixing medications and dietary supplements can be dangerous because it can affect how your body absorbs and metabolizes medication, so it’s best to check in with a doctor first if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications. And, whenever possible, it’s best to opt for products that have been through third-party testing, which can help ensure safety and quality. Research has found that up to 50% of dietary supplements may contain undisclosed substances, so it’s important to choose a third-party tested product whenever possible. We recommend products tested by organizations such as USP , NSF International , and ConsumerLab . Vitamin subscription services are convenient for choosing and purchasing vitamins and supplements. Many offer helpful recommendations based on individual health assessments. It’s also easier to remember to take your vitamins when they arrive at your door each month — some of them even come in dated daily packs. The most important factors to consider are the trustworthiness of the company and the quality of its products. The personalized vitamin subscription services featured here are a great starting point in your search. They offer monthly vitamins and supplements for several unique needs and budgets.

    "title": "13 Anti Inflammatory Foods",
    "url": "https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-anti-inflammatory-foods",
    "domain": "www.healthline.com",
    "text": "Bezzy communities provide meaningful connections with others living with chronic conditions. Join Bezzy on the web or mobile app. Can't get enough? Connect with us for all things health. Studies suggest that some foods can help decrease chronic inflammation. These include olive oil, certain berries, fruit, vegetables, spices, and fish. Inflammation can be both good and bad. On the one hand, it helps your body defend itself from infection and injury. On the other hand, chronic inflammation can lead to disease ( 1 , 2 ). Stress, low activity levels, and foods that cause inflammation can make this risk even more significant. For this reason, eating foods that can help reduce inflammation is strongly advisable. Foods like fruits, vegetables, and spices contain anti-inflammatory compounds and may help reduce inflammation. The most anti-inflammatory foods may include: Berries are small fruits packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Dozens of varieties exist. Some of the most common ones include: Berries contain antioxidants called anthocyanins. These compounds have anti-inflammatory effects that may reduce your disease risk ( 3 , 4 ). A 2018 review of research suggests that phytochemicals found in berries may help delay cancer development and progression. Though more research is needed, they may benefit immunotherapy ( 5 ). Your body naturally produces NK cells, and they help keep your immune system functioning correctly. In another study, adults with excess weight who ate strawberries had lower levels of specific inflammatory markers associated with heart disease than those who didn’t ( 6 ). Fatty fish are a great source of protein and the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Although all types of fish contain some omega-3 fatty acids, these fatty fish are among the best sources : EPA and DHA help reduce inflammation, which may otherwise lead to health conditions that may include ( 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ): Your body metabolizes these fatty acids into compounds called resolvins and protectins, which have anti-inflammatory effects ( 11 ). Studies have found that people consuming salmon or EPA and DHA supplements experienced reductions in the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) ( 12 , 13 ). However, in one study, people with an irregular heartbeat who took EPA and DHA daily experienced no difference in inflammatory markers compared with those who received a placebo ( 14 ). Broccoli is highly nutritious. It’s a cruciferous vegetable, along with cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and kale . Research has shown that eating many cruciferous vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease and cancer ( 15 , 16 ). This may be related to the anti-inflammatory effects of the antioxidants they contain. Broccoli is rich in sulforaphane , an antioxidant that decreases inflammation by reducing your levels of cytokines and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which are molecules that drive inflammation in your body ( 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 ). Avocados contain potassium, magnesium, fiber , and heart-healthy monounsaturated fats ( 21 , 22 ). They also contain carotenoids and tocopherols, which are linked to a reduced risk of cancer and heart disease ( 23 , 24 , 25 ). In addition, one compound in avocados may reduce inflammation in newly forming skin cells ( 25 ). In one high quality study including 51 adults with excess weight, those who ate avocado for 12 weeks had a reduction of inflammatory markers interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) and CRP ( 26 ). You’ve probably heard that green tea , such as matcha green tea, is one of the healthiest beverages. Research has found that drinking green tea is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, obesity, and other conditions ( 27 , 28 , 29 ). Many of its benefits are due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, especially a substance called epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) . EGCG inhibits inflammation by reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine production and damage to the fatty acids in your cells ( 27 , 30 , 31 ). Bell and chili peppers are loaded with vitamin C and antioxidants with powerful anti-inflammatory effects ( 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 ). Bell peppers also provide the antioxidant quercetin, which may reduce inflammation associated with chronic diseases like diabetes ( 36 , 37 ). Chili peppers contain sinapic acid and ferulic acid, which may reduce inflammation and support healthier aging ( 38 , 39 ). While thousands of varieties of mushrooms exist worldwide, only a few are edible and grown commercially. These include truffles, portobello mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms. Mushrooms are very low in calories and rich in selenium, copper, and all of the B vitamins . They also contain phenols and other antioxidants that provide anti-inflammatory protection ( 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 ). Grapes contain anthocyanins, which reduce inflammation. In addition, they may decrease the risk of several diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, and eye disorders ( 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 ). Grapes are also one of the best sources of resveratrol , another antioxidant compound with many health benefits. Studies show that resveratrol can protect the heart against inflammation. While taking a resveratrol supplement is not the same as eating grapes, in one study including 60 people with heart failure, those who consumed two 50-mg capsules of resveratrol supplements daily for 3 months experienced a decrease in inflammatory gene markers, including interleukin 6 (IL-6) ( 49 ). An older study from 2012 found that adults who ate grape extract daily experienced increased adiponectin levels. Low levels of this hormone are associated with weight gain and an increased risk of cancer ( 50 , 51 ). Turmeric is a spice with a warm, earthy flavor often used in curries and other Indian dishes. It has received a lot of attention because it contains curcumin, a powerful anti-inflammatory compound ( 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 ). Research has shown that turmeric reduces inflammation related to arthritis, diabetes, and other diseases ( 55 , 56 , 57 ). In one study, people with metabolic syndrome consumed 1 gram of curcumin daily combined with piperine from black pepper . They experienced a significant decrease in the inflammatory marker CRP ( 56 , 55 ). It may be hard to get enough curcumin from turmeric alone to experience a noticeable effect. Taking supplements containing isolated curcumin may be much more effective. Curcumin supplements often include piperine, which can boost curcumin absorption by 2,000% ( 55 ). More research is needed to understand how the dosage of turmeric affects inflammatory markers ( 58 ). Extra virgin olive oil is one of the healthiest fats you can eat. It’s rich in monounsaturated fats and a staple in the Mediterranean diet , which provides numerous health benefits. Studies suggest extra virgin olive oil may reduce the risk of heart disease, brain cancer, obesity, and other serious health conditions ( 59 , 60 , 61 ). Research suggests that following a Mediterranean diet and supplementing with extra virgin olive oil can significantly decrease inflammatory markers ( 62 ). The effect of oleocanthal, an antioxidant found in olive oil, has been compared to anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen ( 63 ). Remember that extra virgin olive oil has greater anti-inflammatory benefits than refined olive oils ( 4 ). Dark chocolate is delicious, rich, and satisfying. It’s also packed with antioxidants that help reduce inflammation. These may reduce your disease risk and lead to healthier aging ( 6 5 , 6 6 , 67 , 68 ). Flavanols are responsible for chocolate’s anti-inflammatory effects and help keep the endothelial cells that line your arteries healthy. One small study of participants who consumed 852 mg of cocoa flavanols twice daily or a placebo suggests that cocoa flavanols can improve vascular function and decrease blood pressure and arterial stiffness within the first 3—8 hours after ingestion ( 69 ). However, more high quality studies on chocolate and its components are needed. In the meantime, it can’t hurt to choose dark chocolate that contains at least 70% cocoa — a greater percentage is even better — to reap these anti-inflammatory benefits ( 67 , 68 , 70 ). The tomato is a nutritional powerhouse. Tomatoes are high in vitamin C, potassium , and lycopene , an antioxidant with impressive anti-inflammatory properties ( 7 1 , 72 , 73 , 74 ). Lycopene may be particularly beneficial for reducing pro-inflammatory compounds related to several types of cancer ( 75 , 76 , 77 ). Cooking tomatoes in olive oil can help you absorb more of their lycopene content ( 78 ). That’s because lycopene is a carotenoid, a nutrient better absorbed with a source of fat. Cherries are delicious and rich in antioxidants, such as anthocyanins and catechins, which decrease inflammation ( 79 , 80 , 81 ). Although the health-promoting properties of tart cherries have been studied more than other varieties, sweet cherries may also provide benefits. One 2019 study including 37 older adults found that those who consumed 16 ounces (480 mL) of tart cherry juice daily for 12 weeks experienced significantly lower levels of the inflammatory marker CRP ( 82 ). However, another study found tart cherry juice had no effect on inflammation in healthy younger adults after they took it daily for 30 days ( 83 ). More research is needed to understand how cherries might help reduce inflammation. In addition to filling your diet with nutritious anti-inflammatory ingredients, it’s essential to limit your consumption of foods that can promote inflammation may support your overall health ( 84 , 85 ). For example, a higher intake of some fast foods, frozen microwavable snack items, and processed meat products may be associated with higher blood levels of inflammatory markers like CRP ( 86 , 87 , 88 ). Foods like sugar-sweetened beverages and refined carbs may also promote inflammation ( 89 , 90 ). Examples of foods that have been linked to increased levels of inflammation can include: Keep in mind that it’s okay to eat these foods occasionally. Just try to ensure that you follow a well-balanced diet that’s based on whole foods, including lots of fruits and vegetables. It’s best to stick to foods that are minimally processed. Even low levels of inflammation on a chronic basis can lead to disease. Do your best to keep inflammation in check by choosing a wide variety of delicious, antioxidant-rich foods . Eating foods that are as close to their original form and choosing a variety of brightly colored foods can help provide more anti-inflammatory nutrients. Peppers, dark chocolate, fish, and extra virgin olive oil are just a few foods that can help you lower inflammation and reduce your risk of illness. Try this today: Enjoy the powerful antioxidant effects of chocolate by making your own hot chocolate. Heat 1 cup (237 mL) of your favorite milk –– whether it’s dairy, oat, or nut-based –– and whisk in about 1 tablespoon (5.4 grams) of unsweetened cocoa until it’s fully dissolved. For extra flavor, you can add a 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract and a dash of agave, honey, or maple syrup for sweetness. And for an optional anti-inflammatory boost, try it with a pinch of cayenne and cinnamon.  Share this article A diet high in processed foods, fats, and alcohol can cause inflammation.

We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process Second to my love of travel is my love of food. When I’m able to immerse myself in another culture by indulging in their traditional foods, I feel connected to them. Growing up in Trinidad and Tobago (“Trinbago”), my journey with food has been diverse by default. With English, French, and Spanish colonial influences, as well as food practices from Africa, East India, China, and now Venezuela, Trinbago’s food is a true melting pot. However, most of my formal nutrition education focused on the food pyramid and now the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) MyPlate guide — concepts that don’t align with many traditional meals. While MyPlate demonstrates that a balanced plate should be half non-starchy vegetables, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter grains, traditional one-pot dishes blend these food groups into a meal that can’t be distinctively portioned on a plate. For example, it’s impractical to serve pelau — a Caribbean one-pot dish made with caramelized chicken, parboiled rice, pigeon peas, and an array of vegetables and seasonings — within the MyPlate template. As a dietitian and food lover, I thus became confused and frustrated when I tried to create culturally competent healthy meals. I began to wonder, “Are these traditional meals truly healthy if they don’t fit the MyPlate mold, or does the accepted Western understanding of healthy, balanced meals lack cultural competence?” It wasn’t until recent years that I was able to develop a concept of healthy eating that embraces the nuances of cultural foods and inclusivity. I’ll take you with me on parts of that journey and show you what I learned. Although I didn’t know what to call it then, my interest in nutrition began as early as age 7 after my mother’s stroke, as I was motivated to use food as medicine to improve her quality of life. Yet, it wasn’t until my role as a dietetic technician that I discovered my passion for teaching individuals the role that nutrition plays in the management of their medical conditions. In Trinidad and Tobago, these client education sessions focused on healthier ways to enjoy cultural foods, such as choosing the high fiber dhalpuri roti — a traditional flatbread — over its high fat counterpart, paratha roti. When I interned in the United States, I had observed both dietitians and their clients struggle to discuss appropriate food substitutes that respected the client’s food culture . This disconnect could hamper the client’s compliance with their nutrition plan and overall success. Determined to bridge this gap, I work to diversify nutrition education so that people can achieve improved health outcomes without having to abandon their food cultures. I approach nutrition in my daily life with flexibility. At a minimum, most of my meals are balanced and include a grain, a protein, and vegetables or fruit. I include local or regional foods — and I enjoy treats! Fortunately, there are numerous healthy, traditional meals that make meal planning simple, such as sautéed spinach with taro root and stewed fish. With respect to one-pot dishes, such as oil down — a scrumptious dish made with breadfruit, spinach, carrots, and salted meat like pig tails, my focus changes to portion control, adding high fiber side dishes, and mindful eating techniques like paying attention to my fullness cues. As someone with thyroid nodules , I often experience fluctuations in my energy levels, which may negatively affect my ability to prepare foods. Thus, I cook 2–3 times per week, preparing enough for 1–2 days at a time. On Fridays I order out, on Saturdays I typically cook bean soup, and on Mondays I eat leftovers from Sunday’s lunch. This is where incorporating minimally processed foods is key to making meal preparation easier and more convenient. I sometimes purchase pre-chopped vegetables at the grocery store, although I prefer to shop at the farmer’s market for fresh produce. Freezing batches of seasoned meat, fish, and chopped veggies saves time when preparing meals, as does including low sodium canned goods like tuna . To further support my thyroid health, I have reduced my intake of highly processed convenience foods and redirected my attention to whole foods. This meant making my baked goods from scratch at home with unbleached, whole wheat flour during most of 2020 and opting not to purchase frozen waffles and pancakes. It also meant increasing prebiotic and probiotic foods like yogurt and having small amounts of fiber at any given time to support digestion, which may be impaired by thyroid disorders. One stereotype about dietitians is that we all eat the same way. For example, most people don’t expect a dietitian to eat doubles — a fried, curried, chickpea finger food from Trinidad and Tobago — and might regard anyone who does so as setting a poor example or eating “unhealthy” foods. However, doubles are an all-time favorite of mine. I enjoy every bite! If I had a dollar for every stereotype about dietitians, I’d be set for life. Let’s dispel just a few: Of course, dietitians aren’t all the same. We offer a plethora of perspectives and approaches to nutritional therapy. While some swear by calorie counting, others take an anti-diet route and teach their clientele about food freedom and intuitive eating . There’s currently a shift in the dietetics world toward the Health at Every Size (HAES) approach, which is promoted by the Association for Size Diversity and Health. HAES recognizes that health is multifaceted and that, regardless of your body weight, you deserve to receive medically and nutritionally appropriate expertise tailored to your needs. If you’re interested in seeing a dietitian or nutritionist , it’s advisable to thoroughly research the experts in your area to determine whether you’re a good match. During my time pursuing a Master’s degree in the United States, I cured homesickness with traditional meals. Callaloo — puréed spinach, okra, pumpkin, and green seasonings — along with oven-barbecue-baked chicken and macaroni pie is my go-to comfort meal. If I need a quick meal for dinner or breakfast, my routine involves whole grain bread, scrambled eggs or sausages, sautéed vegetables like broccoli or bok choy, and/or fruit. Other meals I enjoy are the previously mentioned pelau, oil down, and roti with curried chicken. While I love fruit as a snack, I also munch on trail mix, dark or milk chocolate, sliced apple with peanut butter, and yogurt. I occasionally purchase local treats like tamarind ball (a sweet and spicy treat made from tamarind fruit), kurma (a crunchy flour-based snack with ginger), and benne ball (made with sesame seeds and molasses). Furthermore, I make fresh juices and smoothies at home to enjoy as morning drinks. Here’s my basic fresh juice recipe (serves one): Juice, pour, and enjoy. My 3-year-old son loves to cook (any excuse to play with water, really) and — bonus! — having a discussion with him about food is quite easy. He joins us in the kitchen and enjoys chopping foods, adding items to the juicer, stirring the pot, and dishing out the food. He’s quite savvy when cracking eggs, too — no shells! Using a divided plate with pictures of food groups (much like this one ) was his first introduction to food portions and the concept of a balanced plate. Having him choose the fruit, vegetable, grain, and protein he wanted gave him autonomy while keeping him involved in his meal. Other creative approaches we’ve taken include creating fruit and vegetable stamps for our at-home arts and crafts sessions, as well as introducing our toddler to the variety of in-season fruits and vegetables in Trinidad and Tobago. His snacks include yogurt , fresh fruit, biscuits, chips, chocolate, and occasionally juice. Dietitians are human, too. Yet, the misconceptions about my profession, as well as healthy eating, lead to scrutiny by family members if I snack on anything other than fruits or vegetables, or if my weight increases a bit. This is hilarious — but also indicative of the mountain of distress caused by diet culture that dietitians and nutritionists must address. In reality, I sometimes enjoy eating just for pleasure and have learned to detach my morality and self-worth from foods. Therefore, I eat without guilt. This doesn’t mean that I overeat empty-calorie foods but rather that I have found my sweet spot whereby I enjoy what I eat while attaining my health goals — and doing so without food obsession. But let me be clear — healthy eating doesn’t have a special look. It isn’t a black-and-white concept, especially when you consider cultural foods. Although the traditional one-pot dishes of Trinidad and Tobago aren’t reflected in the USDA’s MyPlate or conventional, Western notions of balanced meals, they’re nutrient-dense, scrumptious, and a great fit for a healthy diet. All in all, healthy eating should be based on your own tastes and dietary preferences. Amber Charles is a Public Health Nutritionist and Registered Dietitian (RD) based in Trinidad and Tobago.

We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Here’s our process Ozempic (semaglutide) is an injectable medication initially designed to manage type 2 diabetes . Over the past few years, its potential to aid weight loss has captured more public attention. When paired with diet and exercise , Ozempic is an effective treatment option for weight management, but to try it, you need a prescription. The best way to get an Ozempic prescription is through an in-person evaluation. But if you prefer to buy Ozempic online, several options passed our stringent vetting standards. Take a look at what’s happening in the world of GLP-1s .       * Insurance coverage refers to whether program and visit costs may be covered by insurance. It’s important to note that most services will work with you to determine whether GLP-1 medication costs may be covered by your insurance plan. The costs above do not include the cost of Ozempic. Our Medical Standards and Insights team vetted all the brands and services in t his article to ensure that their business practices and medical-related claims align with Healthline’s brand integrity standards and approach to well-being. During vetting, platforms receive a failing grade if they’re found to have unethical business practices, use deceptive advertising, or feature misrepresentative marketing of medications and products. Our Medical Standards and Insights team has carefully researched and vetted over 11,000 products and services. We evaluate services for consistency with standards of care and best practices, and we look into each brand’s reputation before sharing products and services on Healthline. To choose the services on this page, we considered all the GLP-1 services that passed our vetting process. Then, we looked at availability, cost, and the additional resources each service provides to narrow down our list even further. Ozempic is not available as an over-the-counter weight loss or diabetes drug. You always need a prescription to get Ozempic, and you should avoid telehealth providers, pharmacies, or other companies that offer over-the-counter Ozempic, as it is unlikely to be safe. While the convenience of online shopping is appealing, purchasing Ozempic or any prescription medication online without proper precautions can pose significant health risks. According to Duah, if you want to use an online option, “look into the qualifications of the provider first and foremost and make sure they are licensed practitioners.” “[Individuals] should make sure guidelines are quite clear regarding their care, including how often they will have appointments, if they provide lifestyle counseling in addition to the use of medications, how much the medication will cost, how long they will have to take the medication, and from where the medication will come,” Duah said. Finally, there are potential issues to be aware of that can lead to adverse outcomes, including: The manufacturer of Ozempic recently released a statement containing tips on protecting against counterfeit pens that may be on the market right now. Due to occasional supply chain issues , Ozempic may be difficult to get. In these cases, your healthcare professional may recommend an Ozempic alternative , such as Wegovy, Zepbound, or Mounjaro. These drugs work similarly to Ozempic. Depending on which medication your doctor prescribes, you may receive slightly different dosages. As of August 2025, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists all Ozempic doses as available. Ozempic is an injectable medication the FDA approved to manage type 2 diabetes. Its active ingredient, semaglutide, is a synthetic version of the natural hormone GLP-1. This hormone plays a vital role in regulating blood sugar levels. When administered once per week, Ozempic enhances insulin production in response to high blood sugar levels, leading to better glucose management. It helps slow digestion, reduce the release of sugar from the liver, and create a sensation of fullness, working to curb appetite. Ozempic is also becoming increasingly popular for weight loss, which is an off-label use. However, in 2021, the FDA approved semaglutide, the same active drug in Ozempic, under the brand name Wegovy as a weight loss medication. Clinical trials show that semaglutide is an effective long-term weight management tool. However, the medication is only effective when taken continually. A 2022 study found that after stopping the medication, participants regained two-thirds of the weight they had lost within 1 year. When asked about what people should be aware of with off-label use of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic, Janelle Duah, MD, assistant professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine explained, “If [it’s] being prescribed by a physician, then there is no medical issue with taking Ozempic for weight loss, as it is the same [active ingredient] as Wegovy: semaglutide.” Still, Duah cautioned: “One, however, may wonder about the ethics of using it off-label, given medication shortages and reducing the supply available to people who need it for diabetes management. “As well, people should be very careful about purchasing Ozempic from medi-spas and compounding pharmacies, as it is hard to verify that you are receiving the true medication.” Yes, some telehealth companies and pharmacies ship Ozempic directly to your door. It is worth asking the telehealth company whether it will deliver Ozempic. If they do not, then several mail order pharmacies will ship Ozempic to your door. Ozempic is only FDA approved for people with type 2 diabetes. However, doctors sometimes prescribe it off-label for weight loss. To get a prescription, you need to meet with a licensed healthcare professional, in person or virtually, who will determine whether Ozempic is right for you. Wegovy contains the same active ingredient as Ozempic and has been approved specifically for weight loss. You can’t get Ozempic without a prescription from a qualified healthcare professional. However, depending on state regulations, several types of licensed healthcare professionals have the authority to write prescriptions, including doctors, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It can be safe to buy Ozempic online, provided you take precautions. Due to safety and counterfeit medication concerns, the FDA recommends that people only purchase semaglutide medications like Ozempic and Wegovy with a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional. Only get medications from state-licensed pharmacies or FDA-registered outsourcing facilities. Always consult a healthcare professional, like a doctor or pharmacist, before making decisions about medication purchases to help make sure the drugs align with your specific health needs. There is no over-the-counter (OTC) medication comparable to Ozempic. While some OTC medications and dietary supplements may claim to assist with diabetes management or weight loss, they don’t have the same mechanisms of action as Ozempic. The manufacturer of Ozempic offers a savings card for people who have insurance coverage and are using Ozempic for diabetes treatment. Coupons aren’t currently available to people who are using Ozempic only for weight loss. However, medical practices and online services that prescribe Ozempic for weight loss often offer special discounts to customers who purchase treatment plans that include Ozempic injections. ​ The cost of Ozempic can vary depending on factors such as dosage, insurance coverage, and pharmacy. If you use an online pharmacy or telehealth provider, you may also pay additional fees such as a consultation fee. K Health is the cheapest option in our article, offering Ozempic access for $49 in the first month with no consultation fee. Ozempic is available in many territories across the world. It is available throughout the U.S., and is also available in the European Union and the United Kingdom, as well as Australia and Japan. There have been shortages of Ozempic because of its quick rise in popularity as an off-label weight loss drug. This restricted supplies both for people wanting to try Ozempic for weight loss, and those needing the medication to manage type 2 diabetes. The FDA states that, as of August 2025, there is no Ozempic shortage in the U.S. and all doses are available. Ozempic may help you manage type 2 diabetes or your weight loss goals. You need a prescription to buy Ozempic. If you’re eligible for the medication, you can get a prescription from a doctor or online healthcare service, like Ro or PlushCare. Once you have a prescription, you can fill it at the pharmacy of your choice. No matter where you buy Ozempic, make sure you do so from reputable and authorized sources. Avoid purchasing from unverified online platforms or sources that offer Ozempic without a prescription. Getting Ozempic from a licensed pharmacy or a reputable online service can give you confidence in the medication’s authenticity, safety, and effectiveness.

If you have diabetes, you may be concerned about eating well while keeping physical distance, also known as social distancing, or self-quarantining. Keeping non-perishable foods on hand can be a great way to minimize your trips to the store and ensure that you have all the ingredients you need to make nutritious meals. Notably, numerous frozen or shelf-stable foods have a minimal effect on your blood sugar levels. You may even already have some in your pantry or freezer. Here are 18 of the best non-perishables for people with diabetes. Chickpeas are popular in numerous dishes. While they contain carbs, they’re also rich in fiber, protein, and fat — all of which help minimize their overall effect on your blood sugar levels ( 1 ). You can use these tasty legumes to make hummus or falafels. What’s more, they make a filling meat alternative and can be added to soups, salads, and stir-fries. If stored in a cool, dark pantry, dried chickpeas keep for up to 3 years. Canned tomatoes can flavor numerous dishes, including soups and stews. These savory, red fruits are also rich in antioxidants, such as lycopene , which may promote heart health. Plus, they’re fairly low in carbs, so they only affect your blood sugar levels minimally ( 2 , 3 ). Canned tomatoes can be used in cooking or to make sauces. Canned veggies typically don’t expire for several years after purchase. Peanut butter is an inexpensive source of healthy protein, fat, and fiber — and it has few carbs ( 4 ). It’s a great way to make a snack more filling. You can add it to toast or crackers, blend it into a smoothie, or use it as a dip for apples or baby carrots . It’s likewise great in savory dishes like Thai-inspired stir-fry. Just be sure to choose natural peanut butter brands that don’t contain added sugar, as sugary foods negatively affect blood sugar control. After opening, peanut butter lasts for about 1 year. Pistachios are a tree nut that packs healthy protein and fat. They’re also rich in fiber, making them a great snack for people with diabetes ( 5 ). They serve as a crunchy addition to salads and can be crushed to make breading for fish or chicken. Pistachios last for about 6 months in your pantry, although refrigeration greatly extends their shelf life. Canned salmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids , which benefit your brain and fight inflammation ( 6 ). Moreover, this fish is packed with protein and has no carbs. Canned salmon also contains some bones, which are safe and edible — and provide a calcium boost ( 7 ). You can use canned salmon on salads or in salmon patties. It typically doesn’t expire until 2 years after purchase. Seed crackers are crackers made from a variety of seeds, such as sesame, flax, and chia seeds. Seeds serve as a healthy source of fat and fiber, which help slow these crackers’ effects on your blood sugar levels ( 8 , 9 , 10 ). They can be paired with peanut butter or cheese as a snack, or included in a light meal like chicken salad or soup. If kept tightly sealed and stored in a pantry or fridge, seed crackers should last for about 1 month. Chia seeds are tiny black or white seeds. They boost digestive health because they’re rich in soluble fiber and form a gel in your gut. This helps slow digestion and prevent rapid blood sugar spikes ( 11 ). Chia seeds add crunch to salads and smoothies. You can also use them to make chia pudding , a delectable treat that’s delicious with fresh fruit. These seeds last up to 4 years in your pantry. Berries like raspberries are relatively low in sugar and high in fiber compared with other fruits like bananas or apples, so they affect your blood sugar levels to a lesser extent ( 12 , 13 , 14 ). Additionally, berries are packed with health-boosting nutrients and antioxidants ( 15 ). Frozen berries can be used in smoothies, cooking, and baking, and they last up to 1 year in the freezer — although you’ll want to check them on occasion for freezer burn. Cauliflower is a versatile ingredient that can replace mashed potatoes, rice , and even certain pastas like macaroni. Its mild flavor makes it a great substitute for these starchy carbs. Plus, it boasts a very low carb count ( 15 ). Frozen cauliflower can last for up to 1 year in the freezer but should be checked for freezer burn often. Quinoa is a chewy whole grain with a taste and texture similar to that of brown rice. However, it has more protein and fiber — and fewer total carbs — than brown rice , making it ideal for people with diabetes ( 16 , 17 ). Quinoa lasts for about 6 months to 1 year if properly stored in a sealed container in your pantry. Canned mushrooms, which taste milder than fresh varieties, give a nutrient boost to endless dishes. They’re particularly popular in soups and stir-fries. Mushrooms are fiber-rich and low in carbs, so they affect your blood sugar negligibly. Some varieties, including white button , contain ergothioneine, an amino acid that has antioxidant properties and may aid blood sugar management ( 18 , 19 ). Canned mushrooms usually don’t expire until 2 years after purchase. Given that spinach contains very few carbs and calories, you can eat a large quantity with a minimal effect on your blood sugar levels ( 20 ). You can cook it as a side or add it to soups, stir-fries, and many other dishes to increase your intake of fiber , antioxidants, and provitamins A and K. Canned spinach lasts up to 4 years, while frozen spinach keeps for up to 1 year. Canned chicken is fairly lean, rich in protein , and contains almost no carbs. It’s also convenient, as it’s fully cooked and ready to eat ( 21 ). You can use it in soups, salads , and casseroles in the same way as you would use cooked chicken that’s shredded or cubed. It also makes for easy chicken salad. Canned chicken lasts up to 4 years. Dark chocolate is a great treat for people with diabetes — and the darker the better, as chocolate with a higher cocoa content tends to pack less added sugar . Cocoa is also rich in fiber and healthy fats. For instance, just 3 squares (30 grams) of 78% dark chocolate offers 14 grams of fat, 3 grams of protein, and 4 grams of fiber — with only 11 grams of carbs ( 22 ). You can eat it on its own or include it in numerous desserts. A dark chocolate bar keeps for up to 4 months in your pantry, but freezing it extends its shelf life. High protein pastas are usually made from legumes , such as black beans or chickpeas, instead of wheat. Legumes contain carbs but boast more fiber and protein than wheat, making high protein pastas a better choice for people with diabetes ( 23 , 24 ). You can replace regular pasta with a high protein variety in any recipe. It lasts dry for up to 6 months. Most protein powders are low in carbs and added sugars while providing hefty doses of protein. They’re also quick and convenient. Whey protein is derived from cow’s milk, so if you prefer a plant-based option, you can use soy or pea protein powder. Protein powder is a great addition to smoothies, protein shakes, and desserts. It typically lasts for up to 1 year if sealed and stored in a cool, dry place. Shelf-stable milk, whether dairy or plant-based, is always good to have on hand. Although cow’s milk is slightly higher in carbs than some nondairy alternatives, it has protein and fat — unless it’s skim — that reduce its effects on your blood sugar. Alternatively, some plant-based milks like unsweetened almond milk contain few carbs to begin with ( 25 , 26 ). If you opt for plant milk , make sure to buy varieties without added sugar. Both shelf-stable and plant-based milks can be used in various recipes, such as protein-rich smoothies, soups, and baked goods. They last unopened for several months but should be refrigerated after opening. Olive oil is rich in anti-inflammatory compounds , and consuming it regularly may help you manage your blood sugar levels ( 27 ). Olive oil is pure fat, so it contains no carbs to affect your blood sugar levels. However, it’s high in calories, so you should use it in moderation ( 28 ). It’s a popular cooking oil and ideal for vinaigrettes, dressings, and dips. Keeping blood sugar levels consistent is an important consideration for people with diabetes. Since carbs affect your blood sugar levels more than protein and fats, your meals and snacks should all contain roughly the same number of carbs. The number of carbs that you need or can tolerate depends on many factors, including your body size, activity level, insulin sensitivity, and calorie needs. While the best way to determine the right amount for your needs is to consult a knowledgable healthcare provider, here are some examples of a single serving of some carb-rich foods ( 29 ): Try to include protein and fat in each meal or snack to help keep you full and prevent your blood sugar levels from rising quickly ( 30 ). Before making any large changes to your diet, consult your healthcare provider so that they can properly adjust your medications and insulin dosages if needed. If you have diabetes, you should try to keep your carb intake consistent across all your meals and snacks. Here is a sample 3-day meal plan using the non-perishable foods featured in this article. This 3-day sample meal plan can serve as a starting point for your own meal planning using these non-perishable and frozen foods.

    "text": "Like the best protein powders , pre-workouts are some of the most popular, foundational supplements taken by athletes of all disciplines … and for good reason. “ Pre-workout supplements are designed to help you perform at your best during your training sessions ,” states Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD. As is the case with most popular supplement categories, though, finding the best pre-workout supplement for your needs takes more than a quick Google search. When choosing a high-quality pre-workout for your training regimen, you should focus on factors such as caffeine levels, available flavors, third-party testing, and overall value, to name a few. Thankfully, our team of fitness experts has tested and examined more than 100 pre-workout supplements from some of the category’s top brands. Through the lens of our supplement testing methodology , we’ve rated and ranked these energy-boosting pre-workout products in categories such as: The BarBend team has helped connect over 1.6 million athletes with high-quality nutritional supplements over the years, spanning virtually every category from the best BCAAs and creatine, to zinc capsules and (of course) pre-workouts. If your fitness goals are in need of a fresh, new spark, we’re confident that the following details can assist your pre-training regimen with energy support, hydration, and more. Medical Disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice.

It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Join Barbend expert tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC, and registered dietician nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, as they share some of the top pre-workout supplements we tested, including non-stim and all-natural options When looking for the top pre-workout supplement, we value research-backed ingredients in clearly disclosed dosages. Transparent Labs is a company that heavily prioritizes both of those elements in its BULK pre-workout. “BULK gets a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation ,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “It gets high scores for its ratio of ingredients and deductions for the proprietary blends and sodium content.” Transparent Labs BULK is our best-rated pre-workout with a 4.6-out-of-5 overall score, thanks in a big part to its … transparency. There aren’t any blends, it’s gluten-free and contains no artificial sweeteners, colors, or flavors. If you read the label, you’ll know exactly what you’re getting and how much — which is crucial for any of the best supplement stacks . If you consider nutritional labels must-reads and you get great joy out of diving deep into supplement formulations, you’ll love Transparent Labs BULK. BULK’s 200 milligrams of caffeine per serving helped our tester feel a productive surge of energy without a post-workout crash. BULK features big hits of citrulline and beta-alanine, too. “ Beta-alanine is well researched and generally regarded as safe when taken by most adults as directed,” says Justine Hays, M.S., R.D., C.D.N, a registered dietitian and experienced health writer. “ Beta-alanine works by preventing muscle fatigue , allowing you to work out at a higher intensity for a longer period of time.” The flavors are on point as well. One of our testers, a certified nutrition coach, trialed the Blue Raspberry offering and rated it a perfect 5 out of 5. “The Blue Raspberry is perfect — not too sweet and it actually tastes like Blue Raspberry,” they say. “ It’s definitely sweet, but not so sweet that I have trouble drinking it .” However, if you prefer an unflavored pre-workout for supplement stacking, you may be disappointed — BULK doesn’t come in an unflavored option. Solubility earns a score of 5 out of 5, as well. “You can barely even tell there was powder in there,” says another tester, a certified personal trainer. Unfortunately, BULK isn’t the most wallet-friendly pre-workout supplement on the market. One 30-serving container costs $49.99. We gave this product a 3.5 out of 5 for value, as the $1.66 per serving can be costly and may not fit in everyone’s budget. For a cheaper alternative, take a look at Nutricost Pre X Pre-Workout. Out of more than 5,000 customer reviews on the Transparent Labs website, this product earned a 4.39-out-of-5 rating. Here’s what users had to say: “Awesome pre-workout. I got the Strawberry Kiwi and the flavor is really good. Sometimes, it can be a little sour but other times it’s fine — not sure how that works. It helped facilitate a really great workout with good energy and focus, with an amazing pump at the end.” “This gives me the best performance and feeling when working out. It gives me light tingles, but not overwhelming and I feel like it sustains during my whole workout.” Read our full Transparent Labs BULK Review . Let’s be real — spending hundreds of dollars on supplements each month isn’t convenient. Thankfully, some of the best cheap pre-workouts (like Nutricost Pre-X) can keep you energized enough to build muscle and train without breaking the bank. This supplement features a cost per serving of just $0.91 when you opt for its largest container size. As such, Nutricost Pre X Pre-Workout definitely earns a 5 out of 5 for value. This formula has many of the must-have active ingredients (like l-citrulline, beta-alanine, taurine, and betaine anhydrous), but Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD also notes the mental benefits of this makeup, stating, “Nutricost Pre-X contains as much caffeine as around 3 cups of coffee as well as 200 milligrams of alpha-GPC . Research has linked alpha-GPC with improved motivation in healthy adults, so this formula really prioritizes the cognitive aspects of a solid workout.” If you’re sensitive to caffeine, however, the equivalent of three cups of coffee may be a bit extreme. Instead, try Jacked Factory Surge, which is similarly priced but with fewer stimulants. “It contains powerful ingredients, but the doses of some miss the mark just a bit,” says Bourgeois, rating its overall formula at 3.75 out of 5. “I like that Pre-X Workout Complex contains l-citrulline to support performance and recovery, but it may fall short of the ideal dose per serving,” she adds. “There’s no set standard amount of l-citrulline in a pre-workout, but most studies point to a need for at least 6-8 grams per serving. It also contains sucralose, which may cause GI troubles for some people.” You get five flavor options with this pre-workout drink, which is more than most other profiles in the category. “I really liked the Blue Raspberry flavor,” one of our testers says, rating its taste at 5 out of 5. “It’s accurate to the name, for sure. I’ve also tried the Watermelon and remember liking that one, too.” Thanks to few obstinate grains of powder, Nutricost Pre-X loses a point for solubility, earning a score of 4 out of 5. “I don’t ever notice any clumping,” one tester says. “When I shake it in a regular water bottle, though, I do see a small amount of floaties at the bottom.” We give this supplement a 3 out of 5 for third-party testing, as well. The product description does say Pre-X is third-party tested. But our team wasn’t able to find exactly which third-party lab tested the product. For that reason, we wouldn’t recommend this for competing athletes, who may prefer a sport-certified pre-workout. Out of 18 customer reviews on the Nutricost website, this pick earns a score of 4.9 out of 5. “Amazing pre workout. I prefer this over any other brand. I had previously used Bucked Up, but this brand truly feels superior and helps me perform better.” “I have been using the Peach Mango pre-workout for a few weeks now and it’s incredible! Legit tastes like juice, and makes me feel great while getting a good pump. 10/10 would recommend.” If you’re choosing to use a pre-workout to boost your energy, focus, and pumps, but you want to avoid artificial or added sugars, colors, preservatives, and flavors, Legion Pulse might just be the best natural pre-workout for you. The brand claims this is “100% all-natural,” and because they use Labdoor for independent testing, we’re inclined to believe it. “Legion Pulse scores a 4.5 out of 5 for its formulation, with high marks for its natural ingredients, all of which serve a purpose,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. Several of our experts, including two personal trainers, have tested Legion Pulse. “ I like the one-to-one ratio of caffeine and l-theanine because the caffeine content here is high, but the l-theanine balances it out so you don’t feel jittery or overstimulated,” one member of the team says. Another tester, a Level-2 USA Weightlifting coach, thinks even flavor snobs can find a match with this profile. “It’s a sweet pre-workout, and I don’t necessarily hold the bitter aftertaste against it. I mean, it’s not like I don’t have a plethora of offerings to choose from when it comes to finding that perfect flavor,” they say of its eye-popping 23 available flavors. The flavors we have had a chance to test earn a 4-out-of-5 rating for the category, but one tester, a certified health coach, notes that you might pick up on an aftertaste. “ To keep the product natural, Legion uses erythritol as a sweetener,” they state. “ That can sometimes create a bit of an aftertaste, which I definitely got.” However, this natural pre-workout isn’t ideal for those with a tight budget. Legion Pulse comes in at roughly $2.25 per serving, which is definitely higher than average, earning a 2 out of 5 for cost. If cost is a major concern for you but you appreciate ingredient transparency and third-party testing, we’d recommend Transparent Labs BULK, which has a lower cost-per-serving. With just over 21,000 reviews on the Legion website, this product has an overall 4.5-out-of-5 customer rating. “I love this pre-workout. The flavor is not too sweet and it helps keep me focused and efficient in the gym. I do one scoop with 32oz of water.” “I love the clean ingredients. A good flavor. It gets the job done and makes you feel energized without the crash.” Read our full Legion Pulse Pre-Workout Review . For athletes who love sipping on caffeine before an intense workout, not just any pre-workout will do. After testing this product ourselves, we think Transparent Labs BULK Black exceeds other formulas when it comes to energy-producing ingredients, making it one of the strongest pre-workout supplements on the market. “I’d give Transparent Labs Bulk Black a 4.25 out of 5 for formulation with deductions based on the proprietary blends used,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. We also like the added vitamin D in this formula, alongside the 325 milligrams of caffeine. BULK Black also contains a large, 8,000-milligram dose of citrulline malate, which may be able to help improve strength and endurance. ( 6 )( 26 )( 28 ) You also get 4,000 milligrams of beta-alanine, which can help reduce muscular fatigue or delayed onset muscle soreness . ( 31 ) One member of the BarBend team, who has tested nearly 40 pre-workout products himself, rates BULK Black as his favorite supplement of all time. His favorite flavor is Peach Mango, which he gave a 5-out-of-5 rating in the taste department. “ This is so good that I don’t want to finish it. I want to sip it like a fine wine ,” he notes. That said, another tester, a certified personal trainer and nutrition coach , found the Blue Raspberry flavor underwhelming. “ It tastes a little watered down. I’d describe it more as a hint of blue raspberry,” they add. “Maybe with less water, the flavor would be more potent. It has kind of a weird aftertaste, but if you prefer pre-workouts that aren’t crazy sweet, this is the one for you.” “It’s super easy mixing this pre-workout up,” our one tester adds, scoring its solubility at 5 out of 5. “Shaking it up for about 10 seconds makes it seem like there was never powder in there in the first place.” We did have to dock this supplement a little in the price department, however. One 30-serving container costs $54.99, which equates to roughly $1.83 per serving. If price is a problem, you can definitely find cheaper options, like Nutricost Pre X Pre Workout, which has virtually the same amount of caffeine. Out of 651 reviews on the Transparent Labs website, this product earned an overall 4.46-out-of-5 rating. “Don’t take more than half a scoop. The ingredients must be spot on with this pre-workout because never have I felt so pumped off of any other brand. This is the real deal.” “ The taste was not the greatest, but the formula is definitely top-notch. Even though I was tired, I powered through my workout. I just wish this wasn’t so expensive.” Read our full Transparent Labs BULK Black Review . Between your morning coffee and midday energy drinks, you may be already consuming caffeine at the near-maximum daily allowance of roughly 400 milligrams. If you’re looking to avoid more caffeine in your routine, the best non-stim pre-workouts can offer up plenty of training perks including improved focus, endurance, and mental clarity. Of the bunch, we feel Legion Pulse’s Caffeine-Free variation reigns supreme. Legion’s non-caffeinated product contains some of the best natural pre-workout ingredients , including l-citrulline and beta-alanine, among others. ( 9 ) “I also appreciate that this stimulant-free pre-workout is dosed according to clinical research,” notes Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, who rates the formulation at 4.75 out of 5. “Plus, there are no proprietary blends or artificial sweeteners.” When it comes to available flavors, Pulse Non-Stim is available in eight varieties. According to our tester, a certified personal trainer, “The flavors are sweet, but enjoyable. The natural sweeteners can create a bitter aftertaste, though, which I don’t necessarily mind but would like to avoid more often than not.” Accordingly, we score the flavor at 4 out of 5. If you’d prefer a more robust flavor roster, consider Legion’s original Pulse formulation, which is available in 23 tasty profiles. Like its caffeinated counterpart, Legion Pulse Non-Stim earns high marks for solubility, too. “My best shaker bottle was quick to blend this powder,” our tester adds in reference to their 5-out-of-5 solubility rating. “No clumps or grittiness to speak of.” Finally, each tub contains just 20 servings, meaning you’ll need to double up on orders if you take pre-workout supplements for each daily training session. Thankfully, though, the brand does offer a subscription service that can have orders automatically shipped at a cadence of your choosing. Legion Pulse Caffeine-Free currently boasts over 21,000 customer reviews on legionathletics.com, with a combined rating of 4.7 out of 5. “I use ¼ the recommended amount because the tingles drive me crazy but I love that I get the benefits of pre-workout without the caffeine.” “I missed the taste of Fruit Punch . I must say that this supplement brought it back into my life.” “This product is top shelf! I’ve been using it for years and love it! Quality ingredients and the support staff is excellent. I’ve tried a variety of products and they are all good! The key to weight loss and burning fat is consuming fewer calories than you expend, but is there a top-rated pre-workout that might offer a little extra help? If you’re an athlete whose primary training goal is weight management, we think Transparent Labs steps up to the plate with its unique LEAN pre-workout formula. Disclaimer: Please note that none of these products describe themselves as weight loss supplements and should not be taken as such. Please consult with a medical professional before beginning any weight loss protocol. Transparent Labs LEAN has a range of ingredients you’ll also find in the best fat burner supplements . The iodine and zinc may also support thyroid health. Thyroid health is important for maintaining a healthy body weight, as it helps control your metabolism. Some research shows that your thyroid may slow hormone production and metabolism when you lose weight. ( 5 ) However, if you’re taking this pre-workout with a multivitamin, our expert reviewer Justine Hays, MS, RD, CDN, urges caution. “If using this supplement along with a daily multivitamin or other supplements, be sure to read the labels so as to not overdo it on some micronutrients, such as copper.” One BarBend tester, a former Olympian, describes how LEAN might provide a boost for afternoon or evening workouts. “I’m currently training for a competition, so I do feel like the energy and focus boosts help get me geared up after long work days,” they say. “It mixes up well enough, but there are — like with many pre-workouts — a few grains of powder shifting around the bottom,” our tester adds. Accordingly, LEAN scores a 4 out of 5 for solubility. When it comes to flavor, the Sour Grape option is a hit with our team. “It’s a bit more sour than grape, but I appreciate that it’s not overly sweet,” our tester says, scoring the taste at 4.5 out of 5. “I try my best to avoid artificial sweeteners , too, so I love that this formulation uses stevia . “ When it comes to cost per serving, this one earns a 2.75 out of 5. At $1.66 per serving, LEAN isn’t the most cost-effective option on this list. There are other best pre-workouts for weight loss with lower costs per dose, as well, including Cellucor C4 and Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout, among others. Out of 2,517 customer reviews on the Transparent Labs website, LEAN earns a rating of 4.17 out of 5. “I love this product. Would love to see the natural flavors taken out to make this truly a clean product.” “I really like how it works and that it is clean. The flavor isn’t my favorite, but it is definitely doable for the effect.” Read our full Transparent Labs LEAN Review . If you’re planning to sip a pre-workout supplement several days each week before training, you (likely) want one that you actually enjoy drinking. After trying the Unflavored and Citrus flavors, our testers give Naked Energy from Naked Nutrition a 5 out of 5 for taste. “This pre-workout tastes fantastic,” our tester says. “I don’t think the Citrus was overly sweet, and I like that the Unflavored was truly flavorless.” “I’d give Naked Energy a 3.75 out of 5 [for formulation ],” states Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “I love that this pre-workout contains only 10 ingredients and it provides a hefty dose of vitamin C.” However, Bourgeois does wish the included doses of l-arginine and creatine were a little higher. When it comes to the effects, our tester appreciated the boost to their energy levels post-consumption. “It feels like a great pick-me-up,” she says, giving the overall effects a 5-out-of-5 rating. “It’s similar to drinking a large cup of coffee. I didn’t notice many tingles, either.” Solubility is another standout category for Naked Energy, earning a 5 out of 5. “It mixes up completely clear in my best shaker bottle , which is pretty remarkable,” our tester adds. “I’ve honestly never seen that in a pre-workout before.” With excellent solubility and top-rated taste, we’d confidently recommend Naked Energy to anyone who’s highly driven by flavor and drinkability. Unfortunately, we did have to give this product a 2 out of 5 for third-party testing. We didn’t notice any evidence of independent lab testing on this product, and certain people (like competitive athletes) may need something that’s sport-certified, like Transparent Labs BULK. However, we do appreciate that Naked Energy has a fairly simple ingredient list with no artificial components. We liked the price point, as well. One 30-serving container is $44.99, which is roughly $1.49 per serving. However, you can subscribe and save 20%. Out of 816 reviews on the Naked Nutrition website, this product earns an overall rating of 4.7 out of 5. “Naked Nutrition products are always consistent, high-quality , and as advertised with no other additives. I will continue to be a customer.” “A great pre-workout with an excellent flavor! “ Read our full Naked Nutrition Naked Energy Review . Generally, pre-workout supplements aren’t primarily focused on muscle growth, as their ingredients usually target energy, blood flow, and endurance. ( 2 )( 26 ) That said, Nitro Surge is a solid pick for anyone interested in one of the best pre-workouts for muscle gain . Some research has shown that supplementation with betaine and beta-alanine may help improve your body composition and strength. ( 10 )( 32 )( 25 ) In this formula, you get 1.25 grams per serving, though, research suggests that 2.5 grams daily can yield more positive results. “Nitro Surge scores a 3.75 out of 5 for its formulation , with high marks for the ingredients used but deductions for the low dosages ,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. Luckily, Jacked Factory does provide supplement facts for two servings! The caffeine content per two servings may be too high for some athletes, though, so proceed with caution. ( 7 ) “ I usually work out in the morning, but I tried Nitro Surge in the early afternoon and definitely felt jacked up and ready to go,” our tester says. Jacked Factory Nitro Surge comes in 14 flavors, all of which our testers deemed delicious and unique. Our testers unanimously gave Nitro Surge a perfect 5 out of 5 for taste. Kate Meier, BarBend editorial member and competitive weightlifter, says Nitro Surge is her go-to pre-workout because the Strawberry Margarita flavor is heavenly. “If it weren’t for the caffeine, I’d probably just drink this all day long,” she adds. Meier gave Nitro Surge a 5 out of 5 for overall effects, as well, but has a word of warning: “ I only use one scoop each time I work out, which has 180 milligrams of caffeine but is lighter on ingredients like beta-alanine and betaine ,” she says. “ There is a two-scoop dosage on the can, but that is too much caffeine for me. One scoop is just right!” This product dissolves beautifully in shaker cups, earning a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “After about 10 seconds of shaking, it mixes up smoothly,” our tester says. “If you leave it sitting, it can settle a bit, but I just give it a quick shake before each sip.” The one flaw we found with this pre-workout was a lack of independent testing. We tend to prefer pre-workouts that have undergone third-party testing, like Transparent Labs BULK or Legion Pulse. Unfortunately, Jacked Factory doesn’t show evidence of any lab testing performed on Nitro Surge. This pre-workout has more than 22,000 customer reviews on Amazon with an overall 4.3-out-of-5-star rating. “I really liked the flavor more than other pre-workouts I’ve used. It was pleasant and not overly sweet or artificial-tasting. What stood out to me was that it didn’t overstimulate me. Instead, it provided a nice, clean energy boost that lasted for about two hours.” “I love that it comes with a double-sided scooper so you can easily choose between one and two scoops. It works exactly as intended, gives a long-lasting boost in energy with a tiny bit of tingles (which I personally enjoy), and it even helps my mental clarity/focus throughout the first several hours of the day. “ Read our full Jacked Factory Nitro Surge Review . Truthfully, there’s no one best pre-workout for men or women; people of any gender can use whichever pre-workout they want. That said, some pre-workouts can also help fill some nutritional gaps often faced by people assigned male or female at birth. For men who want a more comprehensive pre-workout supplement, Pre Lab Pro Pre-Workout packs vitamin D3, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and iron. We like Pre Lab Pro because it contains 83% of your daily need for vitamin B12, and research suggests that people assigned male at birth may be more likely to have a B12 deficiency. ( 1 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN rated the formula 4.25 out of 5, stating, “I’m a fan of its relatively natural ingredients, and I love how they’re formulated to work together in support of an awesome workout. While the caffeine content may be low, research indicates that combining caffeine with theanine and tyrosine may support cognitive function and mental focus.” Our testers had mixed perspectives on the side effects of Pre Lab Pro. One expert tester didn’t really feel much of anything after taking this product, giving the side effects a 1 out of 5. Our other product tester, though, gave the side effects a 5 out of 5. “I’m pretty sensitive to caffeine, so one serving was plenty to give me energy without the jitters,” they said. If you’re in need of a completely caffeine-free pre-workout, consider Legion Pulse Non-Stim. When it comes to flavor, neither of our testers were left particularly satisfied. We give this category a 1.5 out of 5, as the product tastes a little too acidic. “This is incredibly sour and difficult to drink,” one tester says. “Overall, I like the Natural Berry flavor, but it is exactly like a liquified Sweet Tart. So, I get why some people may not enjoy it,” says our other expert tester. If you’re someone who struggles to get pre-workout down and needs a perfectly balanced flavor profile, try Naked Nutrition Naked Energy, which earned perfect scores for taste and solubility. Unfortunately, this is among the most expensive pre-workout supplements we’ve had in testing. A one-month supply costs $59, which equates to roughly $2.95 per serving. You can subscribe to a four month supply and save 25%, but our team did still have to give the cost a 1 out of 5. Based on 25 reviews on the company website, this product scores a 4.84 out of 5. “I have tried numerous pre-workouts and this is by far my favorite. I am caffeine-sensitive, but want the energy to complete a workout, which this does and has the sodium needed to prevent cramping. I highly recommend it!” “Definitely a nice, clean energy that makes a big difference in my workouts. I like the fact it doesn’t have artificial flavors. I will be buying again.” Being a beginner in the gym can feel intimidating, but with the right guidance and supplementation, it may be a bit less daunting. Onnit Alpha-BRAIN Pre-Workout is designed with slightly lower doses of some of the basic pre-workout ingredients, making it our pick for the best pre-workout for beginners . We had several testers try Alpha-BRAIN (which is also the name of one of Onnit’s best multivitamins). Every single person noted an increase in focus, which comes as no surprise with the included nootropics like ashwagandha and dynamine. We’d highly recommend Onnit Alpha-BRAIN for anyone who wants that extra mental edge in or out of the gym. “ I usually feel more focused with most pre-workouts, but Alpha-BRAIN is one of the best for this,” states one of our testers, a competitive weightlifter, in reference to their 4-out-of-5 effects rating. “ I have even taken this before work instead of coffee just for that extra attention.” You’ll also find 2.4 grams of l-citrulline, which works to help increase the nitric oxide available for use to expand blood vessels and improve blood flow, while betaine may enhance muscular endurance. ( 27 ) This can be a winning combination for some gnarly muscle pumps. (8) However, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, gives the formulation a 3.25 out of 5, noting, “It contains proprietary blends and very little l-citrulline compared to other pre-workouts.” If you’re highly concerned about the ingredients in your pre-workout, this option from Onnit may not be for you. Instead, we’d recommend Transparent Labs BULK, which contains zero proprietary blends. Our testers unanimously recommend the Tiger’s Blood flavor over Yuzu Peach, too. “ I’d give Yuzu Peach a 3 out of 5 for flavor because it is bitter, but Tiger’s Blood is a clear 5 out of 5,” one tester remarks. “It takes about 7 or 8 seconds to mix up, which is super fast,” adds one member of the BarBend team, who rates its solubility 5 out of 5. Out of 7,283 customer reviews on the Onnit website, this product earns a rating of 3.5 out of 5. “Alpha-BRAIN is everything I hoped it would be, I’m more focused and involved. Only give it a 4 because no one is perfect.” “I liked this as a supplement. I didn’t find the results to be as noticeable as the ads suggest, but I could tell a slight difference. Perhaps I need more time with it. The good news is there isn’t a jittery side effect .” Read our full Onnit Alpha-BRAIN Pre-Workout Review . For athletes following a vegan diet , it can be difficult to find a pre-workout that caters to your dietary restrictions. We like Alyne’s product because the included formula is free of animal ingredients and comes in convenient single-serving packets. “It has an impressive list of ingredients, most of which are clinically dosed,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gives the product a 4.5 out of 5 for formulation. “Individual results will vary, but the doses of l-citrulline and beta-alanine may be more appropriate for someone who has already completed a loading phase.” Our testers think the Berry Kiwi Lemonade flavor is unique and unlike any others they’ve tried before. However, it can be a little difficult to drink. “The flavor is a little salty and the beta-alanine and l-citrulline are strong in the taste,” one tester says, giving the taste a 2 out of 5. “I could drink it, but it reminded me of taking a shot of alcohol — not delicious.” If you’re passionate about only using the best-tasting pre-workouts, Alyne’s pre-workout may not be for you. Its solubility shines, though, earning a 5 out of 5. “After about 20 seconds of shaking, I can’t see a single particle floating around,” our tester notes. “When you finish, there’s going to be some bits down at the bottom, but it’s way better than a lot of pre-workouts where it all just collects down there.” And when it comes to the effects, our tester approves. “It doesn’t have as much caffeine as some other pre-workouts I’ve tried,” they say. “But I did notice a boost in my focus during my sets. My brain didn’t wander off and I was able to stay present during the entire workout.” At $2.50 per serving, this is also one of the pricier pre-workouts we tested. For an alternative, Naked Nutrition Naked Energy is also vegan-friendly and at a lower price point. This product has 82 reviews on the Alyne website and earned 4.9 out of 5 stars, overall. “[This is the] smoothest pre-workout I’ve ever had. Doesn’t even compare to the others (Legion, C4, Pre-Kaged, Lit, etc.) I’ve literally tried them all and this one clears by a mile. Quit playing games and get it now.” “ I loved that it was something quick to grab & go on a day to the gym! Super easy to use and, also, the taste was delicious. I liked the ingredients in this and it definitely helped with energy for me. “ Most pre-workouts aren’t specifically designed for men or women (and we believe men, women, and non-binary people alike can consume them). ( 11 ) That said, Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard has some ingredients that may support women during intense training sessions and aid in improving performance, making it one of the best pre-workouts for women . This formula has a dose of folate and a vitamin B-complex. “Folate is an important nutrient for overall health, especially in women,” Justine Hays, MS, RD, CDN, says. Folic acid supplements can be important for women for supporting energy, reproductive, and post-menopausal health. It’s also important for healthy red blood cells — folate deficiency can cause anemia and severe fatigue, making it much harder to function daily, let alone pushing through tough workouts. “They certainly pack a lot of components into each serving of Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout. I like that you get a moderate dose of caffeine, along with an array of vitamins and minerals and creatine ,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, of her 3-out-of-5 formulation rating. Our tester, Kate Meier, has used Gold Standard Pre-Workout several times. “ This gives me a really good energy level and focus for my workout without insane tingles, like some pre-workouts cause,” she says. “Overall, the flavors are actually delicious. It’s easy to overdo the sweetness in a pre-workout, but these strike a good balance,” Meier adds, rating its taste 5 out of 5. “The Watermelon option, in particular, is incredible.” She also notes that you’ll have no problem getting this to dissolve in water. “ I didn’t even use the blender ball one time, and its solubility still gets a 5 out of 5,” she says. We love that the Gold Standard line from Optimum Nutrition is third-party tested through Informed Choice, so we know that we can trust the label. We don’t love that the label has several artificial ingredients; for that reason, we wouldn’t recommend it to anyone who prefers an all-natural pre-workout, like Legion Pulse. Also, we should point out that you’ll find sucralose in this pre-workout, which is probably why our other testers found the drink to be so sweet. Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout currently boasts over 45,000 Amazon reviews with an overall rating of 4.4 out of 5. “It has a great taste, no aftertaste, it’s not too sweet, and not too tart. The ONLY thing I notice is that it never 100% dissolves, but it’s never gritty, so it doesn’t bother me at all.” “The Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout has become my go-to supplement for enhancing my exercise performance and pushing my workouts to new heights. With its powerful blend of key ingredients, this pre-workout formula consistently delivers the energy and focus I need to power through intense training sessions .” Read our full Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout Review . Many pre-workout formulas are packed with a blend of stimulants, and while Gorilla Mode Pre-Workout does have a moderate dose of caffeine, it also contains l-citrulline and glycerol — two ingredients that are crucial in the best pump pre-workouts . Our tester certainly felt the effects, saying, “I definitely noticed a heightened focus shortly after taking it, and I had a good pump.” Gorilla Mode Pre-Workout also contains alpha-GPC and huperzine A, which are intended to promote cognitive function and enhance your mental focus. Combined with caffeine, these ingredients can provide a nice mental and physical boost in the gym, especially for those who want a little extra motivation and focus for a PR-setting workout. It’s also available in 13 unique flavors. However, our tester found Gorilla Mode to be overly sweet, rating it a 3 out of 5 on taste. He said, “It’s very sweet, you can definitely taste the artificial sweetener . Also, because it doesn’t mix very well, it tastes pretty gritty while drinking it.” We wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who wants an exceptionally smooth, satisfying pre-workout, rating it a 3 out of 5 for solubility. Taste and solubility aside, our tester enjoyed the effects. While he found the taste a bit underwhelming, he said this gave him added focus in the gym. We also love that there’s no beta-alanine in this pre-workout. While beta-alanine has some performance benefits, it’s also the ingredient that causes the itching, tingling sensation many experience after taking a pre-workout supplement. Some may prefer that, but it can be a little uncomfortable. Other beta-alanine-free pre-workouts include the likes of 4 Gauge Natural Pre-Workout and Performance Lab Pre Lab Pro. Finally, we love that Gorilla Mode uses third-party testing, which helps ensure the label is accurate, and the product is free of banned ingredients. While it’s not tested by one of the major organizations, like Informed Choice, Gorilla Mode provides a certificate of analysis from Dyad Labs for each main ingredient in its pre-workout, so we trust that the label is accurate. We rate it a 4.5 out of 5 for third-party testing. This pre-workout has 5,788 reviews on the Gorilla Mode website and earned 4.7 out of 5 stars, overall. “I’ve tried this and the non- stim version and I have to say, that extra bit of caffeine really helps extend my workouts. I tend to find myself longer at the gym and able to squeeze in another set when I use this. No weird tingling effect either.” “Not only have I really liked all the flavors I’ve tried so far, but the performance boost Gorilla Mind pre-workout gives me is phenomenal. It’s a nice leveled out and sustained effect that gets me through my workouts and doesn’t leave me jittery or feel like I’m going to crash. It’s the perfect balance of ingredients that work in all the ways I need them to in one balanced dose.” Read our full Gorilla Mode Pre-Workout Review . While we narrowed down the best pre-workouts to our list above, they weren’t the only products we tried. Here are a few others we tried, but we didn’t think they were the best of the best. We’ve tried a lot of pre-workouts (and hit a lot of PRs) over the years here at BarBend . Our team of expert product testers — including certified personal trainers, athletes, and nutritionists, — tried over 100 different pre-workout supplements to find something that works for every customer. Here are the criteria we reviewed in accordance with our supplement testing methodology: Not all pre-workout ingredients are useful, while others might be surprisingly beneficial. Here’s a rundown of the ingredients that you’ll usually find and actually want in your pre-workout. Wondering whether you can build a tolerance to pre-workout? Learn more in our video. Caffeine is associated with alertness, endurance, power output, strength, and perceived exertion. ( 12 ) The FDA puts one small cup of coffee at 100 milligrams of caffeine, while a tall (355ml) coffee from Starbucks has about 235 milligrams. Pre-workouts typically contain anywhere from 80 to 350mg of caffeine. An effective dose is three to 6mg per kilogram of body weight. As the best-researched ergogenic aid besides caffeine, creatine helps power output, anaerobic capacity, and fatigue, all while increasing muscle size by drawing more water into muscles. You don’t have to take it with your pre-workout since it’s an anytime supplement — the point is to increase the creatine in your muscles over time rather than loading creatine quickly. Three to five grams of creatine daily is effective. ( 22 ) The best pre-workouts with creatine may add creatine to their formulations, but ensure it’s an effective dose and something you take every day. If you’re not planning on taking pre-workout daily, it makes more sense to take the best creatine supplements separately every day since it matters how consistently you take it. Older research suggested that five or so grams of citrulline, an amino acid that’s found in high amounts in watermelons, may help with circulation and thereby improve most areas of performance, from endurance to power output. ( 8 ) However, more evidence is needed to confirm the effects of citrulline on performance. ( 8 ) Available studies and meta-analyses have shown mixed results, and the benefits are minor and inconclusive at best. Beta-alanine is linked to improved endurance, both in cardio-focused intervals and strength training with higher reps (between 60 and 120 seconds of continuous work). It’s also known for the tingly feeling (paresthesia) you may feel in your extremities when you take it. Because it allows you to endure more, it may help with hypertrophy. The standard dose is 1.6 to 3.2 grams. If you can’t stand the tingles, splitting the dose into 0.8 to 1.6 grams every three to four hours can prevent the paresthesia. ( 17 ) You can also opt for the best pre-workouts without beta-alanine . Found in beets and leafy greens, betaine is best known for links to power output, blood flow improvements, and muscular endurance, but it might also slightly decrease post-exercise cortisol, which can actually be helpful in your body’s response to stress. An effective dose is 2.5g per day, split into two doses for resistance training. ( 23 ) Taurine may help with improving focus. Since it might draw water into cells, it may enhance recovery and muscle cramps, as well. You can take up to six grams per day about one to two hours before exercise. ( 25 ) Also used for “focus,” data suggests tyrosine may reduce acute stress — like exercise — by helping you produce adrenaline and dopamine. Research has only been performed on people taking at least 500 milligrams, and a minimum effective dose hasn’t been established, but look for at least 500 milligrams. An effective dose might be 100 to 150mg per kilogram of body weight, taken an hour before exercise, but large doses can cause gastrointestinal distress and might need to be split up. ( 24 ) We’ve said it before, we’ll say it again: Everyone is different. So, you may not experience every single effect a pre-workout has to offer. With that said, there are many benefits most pre-workout supplements have to offer. Wondering when to take a pre-workout ? As the name implies, you want to take your pre-workout before you train. The general rule is to mix the powder (if you’re taking a powder, not a pill) in about eight ounces of water and ingest it 30 to 60 minutes before training. This time can allow the ingredients — like caffeine, beta-alanine, and taurine — to absorb and start taking effect. ( 25 ) It might be helpful to take particularly high-dose and large pre-workouts a bit longer before training to allow your body more time to process the extra ingredients, though. On the flip side, if you like to take a long warmup, taking it closer to your arrival might allow for the effects to not kick in fully until you’re done warming up. If you train at night, you may want to avoid caffeinated pre-workouts. Some pre-workouts contain 150mg of caffeine, with certain products packing 300mg or more. The half-life of caffeine has a huge range from three to nine hours, depending on the individual. If you take 300mg at 5 p.m., you could still have 150mg circulating in your body at 8 p.m. on the low end. If it is still circulating, it may make it challenging to wind down and get quality sleep. Pre-workouts aren’t inherently harmful to healthy people who can tolerate the ingredients well. If you’ve never taken a pre-workout before or if you’re starting a new one, it’s usually advisable to start off with a half scoop or less to assess your tolerance and how you react to the ingredients. Some people may not tolerate certain ingredients well, so it’s important to start small. We also strongly recommend talking to your doctor or dietitian before starting any supplement regimen, pre-workouts especially. If you have any pre-existing conditions, speaking with a knowledgeable professional before making changes to your diet or supplement routine is a must. Nevertheless, here are a few side effects some athletes may experience as they start this supplement. Before you take any new supplement, especially pre-workouts, you should always speak with your doctor or dietitian. This is important for everyone, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions that could be impacted by pre-workouts. Assuming you’re healthy and cleared by your doctor, pre-workouts are great for anyone who regularly lifts weights, and wants to enhance their performance in the gym. By providing a boost of energy, enhancing your mental focus, and promoting physical performance benefits, pre-workouts can improve the quality of your training. If you’re pregnant or have any pre-existing conditions, we strongly recommend speaking with a medical professional, as the high stimulant content in pre-workouts may not be safe. Those with specific allergies and sensitivities to certain ingredients, like artificial sweeteners or beta-alanine, may also need to avoid pre-workout powders. Finally, if you’re just looking for some caffeine and aren’t going to be moving your body, pre-workouts may not be a good choice. They’re specifically designed to support physical performance, so a pre-workout wouldn’t be a good choice if you’re studying or working. As we mentioned earlier, it’s very important to speak with your doctor or dietitian before taking any pre-workout supplements. Once you’re cleared, you should always start with half a serving, at the most, to assess your individual tolerance. If you take too much pre-workout, you may experience jitteriness, tingles, headaches, dehydration, and an upset stomach, so be sure to start small to see how your body handles the pre-workout. In addition to starting slow, be sure to drink plenty of water during your workout to stay hydrated. Finally, you may want to avoid taking pre-workouts too late in the day. The high caffeine content can disrupt your sleep, so if you train in the evening, you may want to consider a non-stim pre-workout so you aren’t tossing and turning all night. These sorts of products can make some folks a little concerned about side effects and unintended consequences. While they are legal, it’s important to know the risks to high caffeine consumption, or how these ingredients interact with pre-existing conditions. It’s always a good idea to consult with a performance dietitian or your physician on what the best supplements are for you. There are some things worth keeping in mind when you’re trying to figure out which is the best pre-workout supplement for you. No two pre-workout supplements are exactly the same. Different brands and products have different formulas. So, before you buy any supplement, be sure to read the ingredient label thoroughly and consult your personal dietitian or physician if you have any pre-existing conditions. In most pre-workouts, you can expect to find caffeine. This ingredient helps provide energy but can have some potential downsides, too. It can cause anxiety, diarrhea, and maybe even temporary high blood pressure. This doesn’t mean that caffeine is inherently bad for you. It just means everyone has a different tolerance for caffeine. It’s important to consider your total caffeine throughout the day. For example, if you’re having 2 cups of coffee, 1-2 scoops of pre-workout, and a tea or soda with caffeine, that amount can quickly surpass the recommended maximum daily total intake for adults which is ~400mg of caffeine per day. Perhaps the most common pre-workout ingredient that isn’t caffeine (or flavoring) is beta-alanine, which typically causes paresthesia, a “tingling” sensation on the skin. It’s temporary and harmless, and while some love the feeling of the ingredient “kicking in,” not everyone likes it. Some pre-workout products also have banned substances. These aren’t necessarily illegal or dangerous, but they may not be permitted if you’re a competing athlete. Read the rules of your competing federation or organization carefully to ensure you’re not sipping a supplement with prohibited ingredients. In addition to banned substances, the NCAA and other elite organizations have rules on the amount of caffeine that can be consumed which is why it’s important to consult with a performance dietitian who understands these rules and regulations. Just as different formulas have different ingredients, they also provide varying doses of these ingredients. For most pre-workout ingredients, there isn’t a daily recommended value, which can make it a little challenging to discern whether the dose is adequate. For an ingredient like caffeine, consider that the daily maximum of caffeine considered safe for adults is about 400 milligrams. For other substances, like beta-alanine, in a loading phase, you will want to be in the range of 4-6g per day, divided into 2 doses during the day. Pre-workout supplements aren’t regulated by the FDA, so it’s best to prioritize products that are third-party tested. That means that an independent company tested the formula to guarantee that the ingredient label accurately reflects the ingredients and doses. Keep in mind, when products say “proprietary blend,” that means you won’t know the exact ingredients and their exact amounts, so proceed with caution. For elite and NCAA athletes, we highly recommend avoiding anything with proprietary blends where you don’t have knowledge of or control over the ingredients and the amounts you’re ingesting. For these special groups who will be drug tested, sticking to products with certifications from NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Choice for Sport is crucial to ensure the products have been verified to help you avoid testing positive for a banned substance. No supplement is taken without risk, but this can help minimize that risk. For the general gymgoer, or someone not being tested, look for the USP label: You don’t want to sip on a supplement that tastes disgusting, right? Luckily, pre-workout supplements come in a pretty wide variety of flavors. So, chances are, there’s something for everyone. Before you settle on one flavor, take a peek through the product reviews. There are so many options on the market for pre-workouts, and many seem to have similar formulas. One that stands out from the noise with a potent and robust ingredients list is Transparent Labs BULK. It has well-dosed levels of citrulline, beta-alanine, and betaine to potentially support blood flow and endurance. You’ll also find a moderate helping of stimulants and focus ingredients with 200mg of caffeine along with alpha-GPC, theobromine, and taurine. Strictly speaking, there’s nothing stopping you from doing so, but it is usually ill-advised. The more regularly you take pre-workout, the less effective each dose usually becomes because you build up a tolerance. We generally try to only take pre-workout before particularly challenging sessions or when we really need an extra kick of energy. It’s also a good idea to occasionally take some time off from pre-workouts. You’ll be surprised how much more you might notice the effects after a week away from the ingredients. Everyone’s body processes the ingredients in pre-workouts differently, so it’s difficult to pin down an exact time. That said, you can usually feel the effects of a pre for anywhere from two to six hours, depending on a variety of factors. What and how recently you’ve eaten, how strong the pre-workout is, and your own biochemistry all may play a role in how long a pre-workout lasts. The short answer here is that the price of a pre-workout supplement will vary greatly depending on the ingredient list, dosages, and quality of each ingredient. Most fluctuate between about $1.40 to $3.00 per serving with the average price costing about $2.05 per serving. Although this may seem expensive to some, you tend to get what you pay for with pre-workout supplements. Dry scooping refers to taking a scoop of pre-workout powder dry, as the name implies, without mixing it in a shaker bottle or cup, then (optionally) washing it down with water after. It can be dangerous, though, as mixing the pre-workout with water allows your body time to absorb the ingredients more slowly. We advise against it and always recommend following the label of your pre-workout supplement for instructions on how best to take it. It’s best to drink your pre-workout before going to the gym, as it can take a good thirty minutes to “kick in.” For optimal results, and if you’re in a hurry, it may be best to take pre-workout on an empty stomach so that it digests quickly. Pre-workout supplements are a great choice for anyone looking to enhance their energy, focus, and performance in the gym. If you’re regularly lifting weights and want to give yourself a boost of energy, a pre-workout may be just what you’re looking for.

    "text": "If you’re trying to pack on muscle, eating thousands of calories of whole foods is no easy task. Just like the best protein powders , a high-calorie mass gainer supplement can help increase your daily intake without you having to spend hours in the kitchen. “It is important to understand the balance between workout intensity and calorie intake before beginning to bulk to be successful and also to monitor overall body fat, since the goal is typically to add lean tissue, not just overall body mass,” notes Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. But as with other muscle growth supplements, there are seemingly endless options on the market. Plus, different athletes may have different dietary restrictions or fitness goals. To make things simple, our team of BarBend experts, including personal trainers, athletes, and registered dietitians analyzed and tested more than 10 products, using our profesionally developed supplement testing methodology to narrow the choices down to the absolute best mass gainers for a variety of athletes. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it shouldn’t take the place of advice and/or supervision from a medical professional.

Speak with your physician or nutritionist if you have any concerns or before beginning any new diet or workout regimen. Join BarBend expert tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC , and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD , as they discuss how mass gainers differ from protein powders and unpack our picks for the best mass gainers on the market, from vegan and natural powders to the best-tasting option we’ve tried. High on protein, low on fat, and containing no artificial ingredients, this clean mass gainer should sit well in almost anyone's stomach. Your most challenging choice is whether you want Sweet Vanilla or Chocolate Glaze Donut. To take the top spot, we selected a product that’s simple, effective, and tasty. It’s surprisingly hard to find a mass gainer with all three qualities despite the potential benefits of mass gainers , but Transparent Labs has pulled it off. By far, Transparent Labs mass gainer is one of our best weight gain supplements. “ Transparent Labs Mass Gainer scores a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN . “It accomplishes exactly what it’s intended to accomplish and the ingredients list is very transparent.” For every two-scoop serving size, you get 53 grams of high-quality protein, 110 grams of carbs (from tapioca maltodextrin), and 14 grams of fat, making this a pretty well-rounded product. Bourgeois did dock the formula a bit because the sodium and saturated fat content is pretty high, which may not be ideal for all adults. “Each serving provides 580 milligrams of sodium and 12 grams of saturated fat,” Bourgeois says. “There’s a lot to unpack there but to keep it short, if heart health is a concern, you should be mindful of how frequently you use this powder.” We did enjoy the taste, though. The flavor tastes “exactly like a chocolate donut,” according to our personal testers, who love the Chocolate Glaze Donut option, giving it a 4.5 out of 5. It also comes in Sweet Vanilla; however, those are the only two available flavors. Our team gave this product’s consistency 5 out of 5 points. “I mixed my scoops with water and it dissolved well and had a smooth consistency,” says our tester. Our testers had zero side-effect issues, which was a huge plus, too. Unfortunately, Transparent Labs’ Mass Gainer sits on the pricier side of the spectrum. One 15-serving container costs $79.99, which is about $5.33 per serving. We had to give TL a 3.5 out of 5 for price per serving, as you can find plenty of less expensive mass gainers. However, if you prioritize clean ingredients, this pick is worth the price. TL has a transparent label with an Informed Choice third-party certification. Read our full Transparent Labs Mass Gainer Review . This mass gainer is packed with calories and is among the best-tasting mass gainer products we've tried. You can get it in chocolate or vanilla flavors. If you’re going to be sipping a mass gainer relatively frequently, you want a product that actually tastes enjoyable. Crazy Nutrition’s Mass Gainer takes that standard a step further, offering one of the best-tasting mass gainers on the market. “The vanilla flavor is actually really pleasant,” according to our tester who gave the flavor a score of 4 out of 5. “It actually tastes a lot like a vanilla protein powder.” Unfortunately, though, we were a little unhappy with the solubility, giving this factor a score of 2 out of 5. “One serving is four scoops but we only tested with two scoops,” our tester explained. “Even in a blender, the oat powder settles at the bottom, so you have to shake up the powder every sip. I can’t imagine actually following the instructions without the product being a paste.” Our team gave the formula an overall 3 out of 4. The formulation isn’t bad, necessarily, but it is a little lighter in the amount of calories compared to most whey mass gainers. One serving is 487 calories, whereas most others are 500 calories per serving at least. You also only get about 53 grams of carbs per serving, whereas other products (like Transparent Labs’ Mass Gainer) offer at least 100 grams per serving. All that being said, this could work as a mass gainer for athletes who have smaller frames and need a more moderate calorie surplus, or aren’t trying to put mass on so rapidly and prefer to take their time with increasing calorie intake. We did like the approachable price point, though. One 20-serving container costs $89.99, which is about $4.49 per serving. We gave Crazy Nutrition a 4 out of 5 for price per serving, considering most others sit around or above the $5 per serving mark. It’s important to note that this product uses milk protein, which may not work for all athletes. One of our testers definitely experienced some stomach bubbles. “I’m sensitive to lactose and though this has lactase, I still noticed some stomach upset,” he said, giving the side effects a 3 out of 5. However, another tester of ours noticed zero negative effects. So, start by sipping small amounts and increase your intake slowly if you have a history of dairy sensitivity. Huel Black Edition is a completely plant-based meal replacement that's loaded with vitamins and minerals. You can also choose from a wide variety of flavor options. Huel Black Edition is an excellent pick for bodybuilders, as it’s actually, technically, a meal replacement . This formula keeps fat and carbs pretty low, while maintaining a high protein content, which is ideal for bodybuilders who may be looking to keep their overall macros balanced with a focus on protein. This product packs 400 calories per serving from 18 grams of fat, 25 grams of carbs, and 40 grams of protein. A little different from your standard mass gainer, this product contains 27 vitamins and minerals, earning Huel a score of 5 out of 5 for formulation. Our team loves that you get 29 percent of your daily fiber requirement, too. This is why we chose this as our mass gainer for bodybuilding, as it can help fill potential gaps in competitors’ daily diets, especially if there’s a stringent meal plan. “I enjoyed the Cookies & Cream flavor,” our tester, BarBend editorial member and certified personal trainer Rosie Borchert says, awarding the taste a 5 out of 5 score. “It wasn’t too sweet and it was a satisfying swap for my regular protein shake.” We also gave the solubility and texture a solid rating of 4.5 out of 5. “Huel doesn’t totally dissolve, but I liked the texture it had,” says Borchert. “It reminds me of ground-up oatmeal, but it tastes better than that sounds.” Our tester noticed no negative side effects, giving this category 5 out of 5. This powder is gluten-free and lactose-free, making it very easy on the stomach. “I get an upset stomach after many protein supplements but no side effects here,” says Borchert. “Compared to other products in this category, it does a better job of providing a balance of carbs, fat, and protein. Still, I think it could use a few more grams of carbs and micronutrients to constitute a true meal replacement, ” says BarBend expert contributor and registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois who gave formulation a 3.5 out of 5. It’s also relatively affordable. Most mass gainers cost around $5 per serving, whereas Huel Black Edition is only about $3.11 per serving. However, again, it’s not quite as calorie dense as most mass gainers, which may not be ideal for every athlete. In some cases, you may need to take a double serving to equal standard mass gainer calories. Read our full Huel Review . For athletes who want a meal replacement or mass gainer that's totally vegan-friendly, this is a solid option from Nutricost that's free of artificial sweeteners or flavors. Just as you can find some pretty delicious vegan protein powders , you can find plant-based mass gainers, too. Nutricost’s Organic Vegan meal is one solid option for athletes who need a mass gainer supplement but want to stick to a plant-based diet. When it comes to the formula, we like that this product contains zero added sugars and only uses natural, organic flavors. However, we did have to give the formulation a 4 out of 5 rating, as it is a bit low on macros compared to other mass gainer products on the market. This one only provides 130 calories per scoop, which isn’t as much as we see with other options. Our team does like that you get two flavor options, which is more than some mass gainer products offer. However, it is sweetened with stevia, which some athletes may not like. This is a natural sweetener but it can leave an aftertaste, which may not be everyone’s cup of tea. For third-party testing, we had to give this product a 1 out of 5, as it doesn’t seem to have undergone any kind of lab testing. However, for athletes who prioritize ingredients, this is Certified USDA Organic by the CCOF. For overall value, Nutricost’s Organic Vegan Meal earned a 3 out of 5 from our testing team. It’s not the priciest product on the market but at $2.73 per serving, we wish this were a little more calorie-dense than your average protein powder. However, if you subscribe to recurring deliveries, you do get 20% off. Naked Nutrition's whey is grass-fed and it’s made without acids, heat, bleach, or growth hormone. Other ingredients include organic tapioca maltodextrin, whey protein concentrate, micellar casein, organic coconut sugar, and organic cacao powder. For athletes who want a natural mass gainer, Naked Mass fits the bill. This natural, non-GMO supplement has no artificial additives or sweeteners and the formula is made with grass-fed protein. “I like that Naked kept the sodium content low in some flavors of their mass gainer formula, and I’m a fan of the short ingredient lists,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, giving the formula a rating of 4 out of 5. One four-scoop serving packs 1,360 calories, including 15 grams of fat, 251 grams of natural and complex carbohydrates, and 50 grams of protein. This is definitely one of the denser mass gainer supplements on this list. And while we do like the high calorie counts and balanced macros, some of the flavors do pack quite a bit of sodium (nearly 10 percent of the daily recommendation). “Some flavors are super high in saturated fat and sodium,” Bourgeois says. “You definitely need to be mindful of your overall diet when including such a nutrient-dense dietary supplement in your routine.” Our testers tried the unflavored version, which they rated as an overall 4 out of 5 for taste. “Mixed with just water, it’s a 2 out of 5 on taste because there’s really no sweetness,” our tester said. “With plain milk, it’s like I’m drinking heavy cream, which I also didn’t love. But in a smoothie with some banana, peanut butter, and cocoa powder, you can barely tell it’s there.” For solubility, this product varied, depending on how our testers prepared their shakes. Mixed with water in a shaker cup, we gave the solubility a 2 out of 5. “Even mixed in a blender bottle, there was like an inch of foam at the top,” says our tester. But in a blender, it mixes easily, earning a 5 out of 5 for solubility. So, if you want something that you can shake up really quickly in a cup, this may not be the best pick. Unfortunately, we had to give this mass gainer a score 1 out of 5 on price per serving, as it’s one of the most expensive on this list. One 11-serving container is $69.99, which is about $6.35 per serving. This is a pretty high price for any kind of supplement and while we like the ingredients, Naked Mass may not be affordable for all athletes. Read our full Less Naked Mass Review . This mass gainer includes a blend of whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, milk protein isolate, and micellar casein. So, you'll definitely hit your protein goals with this product. Don’t get us wrong, fiber is a crucial nutrient that’s beneficial for your health. However, too much fiber in one shake can be hard for your body to digest. This product only has 4 grams of fiber per serving, so digestion shouldn’t be an issue. This product also packs 30 grams of protein from a blend of whey concentrate, whey isolate, milk protein isolate, and micellar casein. We love the inclusion of micellar casein, because the extended-release nature of casein protein may be beneficial for enhanced muscle protein synthesis. ( 8 ) Comparing this formula to other mass gainers on the market, we gave Rival Nutrition a score of 3.5 out of 5. The 560 calories per serving isn’t bad but you can definitely find denser options on this list. Plus, we didn’t love that one serving only has five grams of fat. and 30 grams of protein “With 99 grams of carbs per serving, this mass gainer is intended for a very specific nutritional goal, especially with such a low protein content,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. Since the macros are a little unbalanced, you may find yourself feeling hungry sooner than you’d like. “I have the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor which tastes really good,” our tester says, giving the flavor a 5 out of 5. “It really tastes true to the name. I’ve also mixed this powder with both water and soy milk and the flavor stays consistent.” After mixing it in a plain shaker cup, our tester rated the product with 5 out of 5 points for solubility. We noticed no clumps at all, which is pretty uncommon for dense supplements. “With every other mass gainer product I’ve tested, you usually see clumps or a grainy texture,” our tester says. “That’s not the case at all here.” Our tester was happy to note that they had zero side effects. “I have GI issues with mass gainers pretty often but my stomach was fine with this one,” they say. This product is also pretty reasonably priced. Whereas most mass gainers are around $5 per serving, this one is only about $2.73 per serving. Of note: Our tester really didn’t love the included scooper. “It’s an odd shape and it has a point to make it easier to pour into a narrow spout,” they said. “But I actually find myself spilling the powder more often than with a standard scooper.” If you’re prone to spilling, you may want to keep a spoon handy. Mutant Mass comes in a five-pound bag and six different flavor options, so there's something for every athlete. This mass gainer packs plenty of protein and includes whole food ingredients. For athletes who want a mass gainer with protein powder, Mutant Mass is a solid choice. This formula contains a whey and casein blend, packing 28 grams of protein per serving. Thanks to the blend, this product combines a fast- and slow-digesting protein (thanks to the casein protein ), so your body gets plenty of time to absorb the protein. ( 8 ) While we like the protein content in Mutant Mass, we did have to give the formulation a 3.5 out of 5. Calorie-wise, this one definitely suffices as a mass gainer. Per serving, you get six grams of fat, 96 grams of carbs, and 28 grams of protein. “ Without sufficient protein and fat to digest alongside that many grams of carbs, you might be at risk for a blood sugar spike and crash ,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. Additionally, this product uses sucralose as a sweetener, which some athletes may prefer to avoid. One serving also contains 13 percent of your daily sodium, which is something to watch out for if you need to monitor your sodium intake. “I tried out the Cookies & Cream,” our tester says, giving the flavor a 3 out of 5. “It wasn’t my favorite, I’m not going to lie. It was really sweet and artificial, in my opinion.” That being said, this may not be the case for other flavors. We also thought that the solubility could use some work. “I actually found this product to be pretty clumpy,” our tester says, giving the solubility a 2 out of 5. “At the same time, too, it was really thin.” This product isn’t third-party tested, which we thought was a shortcoming. However, the price per serving was pretty approachable, especially compared to other mass gainers. One 16-serving container costs $44.99, which is about $2.81 per serving. Most other mass gainers are at least $3 per serving. This mass gainer contains 1,250 calories per serving, 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of most vitamins and minerals, and 50 percent of your daily v itamin D , which is important for testosterone. For those who want to save some money, this product is a relatively budget-friendly pick at $44.99 per tub (price varies minimally by flavor). That’s about $5.62 per serving, which is a little pricey but you get significantly more calories and nutrients than other mass gainers at the same price point. So, while our testers did give this a 3.5 out of 5 for price per serving, it’s still a good money saver considering most athletes probably won’t need an entire serving at a time. Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass contains 1,260 calories per serving, 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of most vitamins and minerals, and 50 percent of your daily vitamin D. “It boasts an impressive vitamin and mineral profile,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gave the formula a 4 out of 5. “I like that it includes five grams of creatine in every serving of their Serious Mass supplement.” We didn’t fall in love with the Vanilla flavor, though. “It’s not terrible but the Vanilla tastes like a typical artificial vanilla powder,” our tester says, giving the taste a 3.5 out of 5. “However, it won’t overpower any other flavors. So, if you add it to a smoothie with other ingredients, it’s totally drinkable.” We gave the solubility a 4 out of 5, as it dissolved better than some other mass gainers we tried. “I didn’t have any lumps floating around, but I did need to pulse it in my blender for a while,” says our tester. We’ve found the need for a blender to be the case for most of the supplements on this list. Our testers also gives this product a 5 out of 5 for side effects, as they didn’t notice any stomach unrest or bloating . Read our full Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass Review . MuscleTech Mass Tech Extreme 2000 is among the highest-calorie mass gainers. This product packs more than 2,000 calories per serving and it's also especially high in carbohydrates. For athletes who want a mass gainer that’s especially high in carbs, this pick from MuscleTech fits the bill. This supplement has 460 carbs per serving, which is more than any other product on our list. You also get 60 grams of protein and 6 grams of fat per serving, totaling 2,130 calories. “MuscleTech Mass Tech Extreme is undoubtedly named appropriately. Its nutrition facts are EXTREME,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. While we like the density here, this supplement does include some artificial sweeteners , and the macros aren’t exactly balanced, so we gave the overall formula a 3 out of 5. Although we didn’t notice any side effects after trying this product, our tester didn’t fall in love with the flavor. “The Triple Chocolate Brownie had a mocha flavor, which I didn’t really love,” said Kate Meier, CPT , a certified personal trainer and BarBend editorial member. “It tasted way more like mocha fudge, so I’d give it a 2 out of 5 for taste.” The solubility wasn’t exactly ideal either. When mixed with water, Meier found it to be extremely thin but with milk, the texture is way too thick. “It’s almost like a pudding more than a shake,” she said, giving the texture and solubility a 2 out of 5. While this product definitely hits the high-carb mark, the price is a little less satisfying. One five-serving bag costs $54.99, which is nearly $11 per serving. We had to give the price per serve a 1 out of 5. However, the macros are nearly double most other mass gainer supplements, so you likely wouldn’t be taking a full serving at a time. Dymatize Super Mass keeps calories high, packing plenty of carbs and protein per serving. This is also a budget-friendly option for those who can't spend a ton on their supplements. For athletes who want to ingest plenty of calories each day, a hefty mass gainer can help. This pick from Dymatize contains 1,280 calories per serving, including 10 grams of fat, 245 grams of carbs, and 52 grams of protein. Our team gave the formula an overall 3.5 out of 5, though, knocking some points for macro balance and the inclusion of artificial sweeteners, including sucralose. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing but can cause digestive unrest for some. “I actually liked the Vanilla flavor,” our tester said, giving the taste a score of 4 out of 5. “Some vanilla supplements can taste artificial but this one wasn’t overly sweet.” We do wish there were some more flavor options, though, considering you can only choose from Chocolate or Vanilla. This may get a little dull, especially if you’re planning on taking a mass gainer regularly. We also gave Dymatize a score of 5 out of 5 for solubility. “Unlike other mass gainers I’ve tried, this one dissolves really well,” says our tester. Plus, our testers didn’t notice any unwanted side effects, including bloating or gas. “Dymatize Super Mass Gainer contains a huge serving of carbs and very small portions of protein and fat. However, it does feature an impressive vitamin and mineral profile. ” notes Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “Still, like with any mass gainer, it should be consumed with caution.” One eight-serving container of Dymatize’s Super Mass Gainer costs $39.98, which is only about $4.99 per serving. Considering how many calories you get per serving, this is pretty budget-friendly. Most other mass gainers with similar macros cost well over $5 per serving. Plus, it’s available on Amazon Prime, so you can subscribe to monthly deliveries and save even more. [Related: Best Macros Calculator for Tracking Muscle Gain and Fat Loss] Mass gainers are a particularly tricky supplement, as different athletes have different needs. Are you looking to save money on calories, add to your nutrient intake, or find a tasty way to gain mass? Using our supplement testing methodology , our team of experts tested more than 10 different mass gainers to find a product for every reader. Here’s the criteria we considered: So can you add a bunch of liquid, powdery calories to your diet without any issues? As with other supplements, there are mass gainer pros and cons , but when done right, here are some of the benefits. The price of mass gainers varies by brand and ingredients. The straightforward mass gainers that focus on macros and don’t include many micronutrients tend to be less expensive, whereas the mass gainers with fewer artificial ingredients, and more vitamins and minerals, tend to be more expensive. Since mass gainers can be used for multiple purposes — gaining muscle mass, filling dietary gaps, consuming more calories, etc. — you’ll want to consider a few factors, and how they may work with your workout regimen and lifestyle before you choose a mass gainer to add to your supplement stack . The calorie count in mass gainers varies widely. You can have mass gainers that are as low as 200 calories, and some that are over 1,000 calories. Browse different brands for different calorie options, depending on your fitness goals . It’s important to look at not only the total calorie content per serving of a mass gainer, but where those calories are coming from. Mass gainers have a wide range of protein-to-carb ratios. The lower ratios (like 1:2 protein:carbs) are going to be ideal for those seeking to build lean muscle. Those closer to the 1:5 protein:carbs ratio are going to be better for athletes who are trying to bulk or add calories and carbs to their diet. Many mass gainers also contain vitamins and minerals in their formulas. From different types of creatine to digestive enzymes, these additions are meant to support other aspects of your health, like digestion or energy, rather than just supplementing specific macros. If a mass gainer contains an additional supplement you’d like to take, it could be convenient to have it all in one go. For others, a more straightforward formula that simply provides the calories, carbs, and proteins they need to maintain and grow muscle mass is ideal. You’ll want to decide what additional ingredients (if any) you want in your powder before snagging a pick off of this list — typically the more micronutrients , the higher the price tag. As we mentioned, there are other ingredients in mass gainers like vitamins, minerals, and often digestive enzymes. These can help to ensure you’re eating a relatively balanced and well-rounded diet when bulking or adding mass. Reviews and testimonials can usually be taken with a grain of salt individually, but trends can signal how people feel overall about the product. If a mass gainer is consistently receiving glowing reviews and high rankings, then it probably is the real deal. Before you go ahead and buy the first mass gainer you find, take some time to compare prices. Different brands may have similar ingredients and macronutrient profiles, yet the prices can vary pretty drastically. This is one of the most easily misunderstood and misused categories of supplements, so read on before clicking the “buy” button. A lot of people think, “I want to gain mass, so I’ll drink a mass gainer.” Great, but what kind of calorie surplus is it putting you into? Experts tend to agree that you’re unlikely to gain more than a quarter to half a percent of your body mass in muscle per week. That’s maybe an extra 200 calories over your daily calorie burn — any more than that, and it probably won’t be the kind of bulk you want to gain. “To find foods that are great for bulking, you need to look for nutrient-dense options, that also provide a lot of calorie bang for your buck,” advises Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. If you want to gain muscle mass, running on the treadmill a few times a week likely won’t produce the physique you’re after. Heavy compound lifts and plenty of hypertrophy-focused workouts are the order of the day. Find a well-planned, properly periodized program to accompany you on your muscle-building journey. People tend to work themselves into a frenzy for more and more calories, no matter where they come from. This is called a “dirty bulk.” “Those who ‘dirty’ bulk eat anything and everything, without regard to the quality, which usually means more ultraprocessed foods that are often calorie dense, but limited in nutrition. This can lead to more fat gain as you gain muscle ,” says Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. Remember that carbs, protein, and fats aren’t the only important nutrients: Hit your recommended daily intake of all your nutrients, not just the ones that provide calories. Half of the classic bodybuilding movie Pumping Iron is Arnold Schwarzenegger taking naps. Optimal sleep helps the body produce testosterone and growth hormone, and reduce catabolic hormones like cortisol. It’s an incredibly important piece of the puzzle, so don’t leave it out. Transparent Labs Mass Gainer is a BarBend favorite for its high-quality formula. It contains 740 calories, 53 grams of protein, 109 grams of carbs, 12 grams of fat, and 8 grams of fiber to top it off. It also comes in two distinctly delicious flavors with a fairly reasonable price point, considering its ingredient list,macro content, and third-party certification. Speaking generally, mass gainers have a ton more carbs and fat to provide additional calories than protein powders and often come with added micronutrients. They’re also usually much larger in serving size and will feature slower digesting forms of protein like whey concentrate instead of whey isolate. Mass gainers are designed to provide calories and nutrients to put you in a caloric surplus so you can potentially gain muscle, while protein powders are intended to aid in recovery and help you reach your daily protein intake goals . If you’re sticking to your calorie goal, exercising right, getting the right amount of macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat), and you’re not falling short in your daily doses of vitamins and minerals, then mass gainers can help you to add muscle and minimize fat gain. Simply adding a lot of calories without monitoring your intake isn’t the right way to go about muscle gain, but if your calories are dialed in, then mass gainers alone won’t cause issues. Most people have trouble gaining mass without gaining any fat, but if you gain fat, it won’t be because of the supplements. (It’ll be because your calories and total energy expenditure aren’t perfectly synced.) As with any supplement, there is no magic pill or shortcut to results, but mass gainers are relatively straightforward products. They generally provide a high number of calories and nutrients, which are intended to put you in a caloric surplus so your body has the nutrition to add muscle. You still need to work hard in the gym and be consistent with your other nutrition and sleep, but mass gainers may help people who are trying to pack on mass, as the name implies. The main potential side effect of mass gainers is digestive issues: bloating, gassiness, and other signs of an upset stomach. This isn’t to say mass gainers will cause these issues when used responsibly; rather, haphazardly consuming a lot more calories than the body is used to can tax the digestive system. To minimize these issues, try to only eat an average of 200 calories over your daily calorie burn, eat the right amount of fiber, and consider supplementing with digestive enzymes and probiotics. Absolutely, and most people do in order to achieve the best potential outcome. While you don’t need to take them daily, it’s usually recommended, but there are some reasons you might choose not to. If you’re primarily looking to increase your calorie intake on particularly difficult training days or if you’re using a mass gainer as a stand-in for a meal, then you might be more selective about when you take your mass gainer. If you’re looking to gain muscle mass, it may be helpful to take a mass gainer right after your workout, but it’s not necessary. You don’t need to be a huge stickler with timing. As long as you are eating enough protein, carbs, and fats throughout your day (or in surplus, if you want to gain mass), you should start to see results.

    "text": "Wondering what the keto diet is and whether you should try it? The keto diet is a popular choice among athletes, given its potential to help you lose weight while staying lean. It’s even shown promising results in supporting athletic performance, although more studies are needed to understand this relationship. ( 1 ) Following this diet involves strictly controlling your macros so that your diet is high in fat, low in carbs, and moderate in protein. ( 2 ) But when every supplement seems high in carbs, we know the search can be challenging — even the best protein powders for keto can be difficult to decipher. To help you on your keto journey, we’ve gathered up our picks for the best keto protein powders (tested and trialed by our nutrition and fitness experts) based on criteria including fat and carb content, protein content and source, calories, flavor, value, mixability, and third-party testing. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. The BarBend team is made up of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. To determine the best keto protein powders, we’ve tested nearly 100 different supplements from some of the industry’s most trusted brands using a multi-point methodology to rate each profile on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Below are some of the categories and components that played into our rankings. We also worked with a third-party accredited lab of our own to rate and score a handful of picks, analyzing each product’s purity and label accuracy. Ratings for areas including the presence of metals, pesticides, phthalates, bisphenols, and overall label accuracy were based on how well each protein sample compared to others in the sample pool. For further information on how we trial and test the products chosen for this guide and more, be sure to read the BarBend Supplement Testing Methodology page. With 8 different flavors and 28 grams of whey protein from hormone-free, grass-fed cows, Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is an excellent way to hit your protein macros. If you’ve ever wondered, “ Is whey protein keto? ” – the answer is yes! Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is our favorite keto protein powder overall – it contains a high-quality protein source and electrolytes without the fluff. With 13 delicious and decadent flavors that are compatible when blended with high-fat nut butter, MCT oil, or coconut oil, this pick doesn’t disappoint. As registered dietitians, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D., and I rated the formula a 4 out of 5. Bourgeois states, “ I love that Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is free from artificial sweeteners, food dyes, and preservatives. You get 28 grams of high-quality protein without any unnecessary fluff. Plus, it’s third-party tested, with certificates of analysis available to view on their website.” This formulation also contains whey isolate, so your body digests the protein more readily than other protein sources. ( 5 ) Another benefit of this formula is that it contains electrolytes (sodium and potassium), which can help ward off the keto flu when you first start a keto diet. ( 6 ) “Some flavors contain up to 370 milligrams of sodium per scoop, which is higher than many other protein powders on the market,” Bourgeois adds. It’s also low in net carbs, with only 1 gram of net carbs per serving, which is perfect for keto. However, since the keto diet calls for higher fat content, we wish it contained more fat from healthy sources like MCT oil, coconut, or nuts. Pro Tip: We recommend bulking up the fat macros by adding some nut butter and oat or coconut milk — with the delicious flavors this product offers, you can whip up some filling milkshakes. Our tester states, “This Transparent Labs sample left me plenty satiated and served as a great addition to my meals or in-between snacking protocols.” As for taste, we gave this product a score of 4 out of 5, with some potential upside when blended into a milkshake. We loved that it came in many different flavors, so you’re bound to find one that you’ll enjoy. “I did feel that the taste was somewhat chalky at times but by no means overwhelming or unappealing,” our tester adds. Moreover, we tested Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate for heavy metals, pesticides, phthalates, bisphenols, and label accuracy with an accredited, independent lab, Ellipse Analytics. It ranked in the top 25% of more than 150 protein products tested and received an overall B grade. So, if you’re looking for a solid protein base for milkshakes that’s low in net carbs, contains high-quality protein, and supports keto flu symptoms, try Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate. It’s a little pricier, but it may be worth it. Read our full Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate Review . Dig into this easily digesting grass-fed whey isolate that provides 25 grams of protein with each lean 110 calorie scoop. It comes in three tasty flavors at a cost-effective price making it a solid choice for nearly anyone. To lose weight, you’ll want to achieve what’s called a calorie deficit. This means that to lose about a pound a week, you’d need to reduce your calories by 3,500 calories through a combination of diet and exercise. ( 7 ) While supplementing with protein powders helps, many of them are too high in carbs or calories. With only 110 calories and 1 gram of carbs per serving, Jacked Factory Authentic ISO has a low-carb, low-calorie nutritional profile that’s ideal for supporting your weight loss. It also boasts a simple ingredient list and uses whey isolate as the protein source, which digests more efficiently than standard whey, making it one of the best protein powders for sensitive stomachs . ( 5 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D., who is a registered dietitian, commended the formulation and rated it a 4.25 out of 5. She states, “ I like that Jacked Factory uses whey protein from 100% grass-fed cattle, and I love its macro breakdown. Each scoop has an impressive 25 grams of protein with minimal carbohydrate and fat content.” The only downsides with this formulation are the sodium content and the lack of third-party testing. While sodium can help mitigate symptoms of the keto flu, some flavors provide up to 300 milligrams of sodium, which may be too high. For context, the USDA recommends limiting sodium intake to less than 2300 milligrams per day. ( 8 ) “If you’re watching your sodium intake for any reason, you might not be keen on this protein powder,” Bourgeois adds. Another great reason why this product is excellent for weight loss is its excellent taste. While many ‘diet’ products often taste horrible, this protein powder is absolutely delicious. Our tester rated it a 5 out of 5. “ I liked the slightly sweet profile, and the stevia included in the formulation didn’t taste overwhelming. I mixed the Vanilla flavor with milk and ice, which seriously tasted like a diner milkshake.” As for solubility and texture, our tester rated this product a 4 out of 5. Our tester states, “I blended this powder in my standard shaker bottle and with a cup and spoon. In both scenarios, the powder dissolved easily within 10 seconds without sticking to the sides. There weren’t any clumps or residue, but it’s a bit on the thicker side.” Pro Tip: We recommend using this supplement as a meal replacement, post-workout treat, or after-dinner dessert to help curb your sweet cravings and calorie intake. Some people, though, may not like the thick texture. Overall, if you need a keto protein powder with a thick and creamy texture, excellent macros, and great taste to support your weight loss goals, try Jacked Factory. Read our full Jacked Factory Authentic ISO Review . One of the very few protein powders with no carbs or fat whatsoever, this product contains 25 grams of whey protein isolate and is great for anyone looking for a leaner protein option. Look no further if you want a keto-friendly protein powder that tastes like chocolate milk. With over 500 5-star reviews on the XWERKS website and sparkling reviews on Amazon, XWERKS Grow is your best bet if taste is a priority. Our product tester, who is a certified personal trainer, loved this product’s taste. They rated its taste a 5 out of 5, and they note, “Honestly, the Chocolate variety reminds me of a bottle of Yoo-hoo. It’s smooth, creamy, and just plain enjoyable – it’s the finest protein powder I’ve ever consumed.” This pick also blends seamlessly with no clumps or residue. Our tester rated it a 5 out of 5 for its texture, stating, “ I had no problems when mixing this powder. The texture is very smooth, and there are no clumps. You barely need a blender ball at all.” However, the texture can be a little thin for some people, so we recommend mixing it with a dairy base rather than water – you can also add nut butter for additional fats and to bulk up your shake while on keto since the fat content in the powder itself is a little low. We rated this product’s excellent formulation a 4.5 out of 5, with high marks for its protein content and natural sweeteners. It’s one of the best clean protein powders out there and consists of 100% New Zealand-based grass-fed cow’s milk. C helsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D. states, “I like that XWERKS Grow is a lean protein powder, providing 25 grams of protein per scoop. And with 6 grams of BCAAs, it’s ideal for muscle building.” Plus, since the protein source is whey isolate, it’s great for digestion, and the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) can support your recovery after exercise. ( 5 )( 9 ) While on the pricier side, XWERKS Grow does provide 25 grams of protein per serving, and if the taste is important to you, this pick is a delicious and nutritious option for your keto lifestyle. Read our full XWERKS Grow Review . Need a protein powder that’s light on cost yet heavy on flavor? Available in four traditional tastes — Chocolate Peanut Butter, Chocolate, Strawberry Milkshake, and Vanilla — this Nutricost offering is available for less than $1 per serving, which can be ideal for athletes looking to build a well-rounded supplement regimen on a budget. You may not have heard of Nutricost, but the brand name says it all – you get a nutritious protein powder at a fair cost. While the flavors are pretty standard, if you know what flavor you want to get, you can buy the 5-pound tub at an economical price of $0.88 per serving. That can go a long way since the average person spends a whopping $124.40 monthly on fitness. ( 4 ) After all, why worry about limiting intake to the best time to drink a protein shake when you can drink several shakes a day for the price of one standard shake? For a value formulation, the mixability and taste aren’t too shabby. Our tester rated the taste a 5 out of 5 and states, “Having used this protein daily for a few weeks, I can confidently say I enjoy this product. I mixed it with water and milk interchangeably and felt the flavor come alive with milk. The Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor is super creamy and just the right amount of sweet.” It also mixes well in water, dairy, and smoothies without making a mess, a common problem with ketogenic diet protein shakes. “Even with just a shaker bottle, I had no issues with this powder’s solubility. There weren’t any clumps or residue, and the texture turned out fine,” our tester adds. Despite the cheap cost, Nutricost Whey Concentrate is a pretty lean protein with an impressive amino acid profile that doesn’t skimp on nutrients. C helsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D. states, “ Nutricost Whey Concentrate is a fairly lean protein powder. It still provides more carbs and fat than your average powder, but it prioritizes protein over the other macros. Plus, it contains a 2:1:1 ratio of your BCAAs, which research has shown to be most effective.” Its protein source is whey concentrate, which is a more concentrated version of standard whey, to provide you with as much protein density as possible with 25 grams per serving. ( 5 ) However, one big downside is that this product includes artificial sweeteners (sucralose and acesulfame potassium), so Bourgeois rated it a 3.5 out of 5. “This whey protein contains sucralose, which can be hard to digest for some,” Bourgeois states. It also contains sunflower lecithin as an emulsifier, which is a filler ingredient that doesn’t contribute to nutritional value. And while it’s produced in a GMP-compliant facility and supposedly third-party tested, Nutricost doesn’t disclose who does the third-party testing. So, while Nutricost is budget-friendly, it’s not among the cleanest options available. Gainful Protein Powder is fully customizable, allowing you to get a product that meets your specific health needs, including losing weight, gaining weight, or building muscle. If you’re searching for one of the best vegan protein powders , Gainful allows you to personalize your own plant-based, keto-friendly powders. With only three simple, vegan, and plant-based ingredients – organic pea protein, organic brown rice protein, green tea extract – it’s an ideal plant-based protein powder for keto diets. While following a keto diet can consist of eating many animal-based, high-fat foods, a plant-based version of keto consisting of healthy fats can help minimize the effects of eating many animal-based foods. ( 10 ) And while plant-based powders often aren’t flavorful, you can choose your own adventure with Gainful. Our product tester, who is a certified personal trainer, rated the taste a 5 out of 5. They state, “ The base powder comes unflavored, and Gainful gives you different flavor packs that allow you to mix up flavors from shake to shake. I liked the Chocolate and Vanilla flavors, but there are plenty more to choose from.” However, as is the case with a lot of plant-based powders, the mixability wasn’t great. Our tester states, “I did find some clumps when mixing this powder, so I’d recommend using a countertop blender to ensure you break up all the powder. I dealt with it at the start because I enjoyed the taste, but I’ll likely break out the heavy artillery for future tests to achieve a smoother, less clumpy makeup.” While our tester rated the solubility a 3 out of 5 compared to other whey options, we think it’s appropriate for a plant-based powder. One of the biggest perks of choosing Gainful is that you get matched to a personalized protein powder to help your specific needs and access registered dietitians who are experts in sports nutrition. Our tester states, “Gainful has you complete a short quiz that asks you about your fitness goals and then creates a protein powder profile for you. Plus, as part of your Gainful membership, you get access to a registered dietician to help you along your nutritional journey — a great perk, in my opinion, for newcomers.” Having access to a registered dietitian can help in many ways, but especially for athletes with ever-changing fitness and performance goals, it’s helpful to get a second opinion throughout their journey. With the support of an RD, you could ask not only about the benefits of different types of protein but also common questions like keto vs. paleo diet . Chelsea Bourgeois, M.S., R.D., L.D.N., states , “ Dietary goals change over time, as do nutrition needs, so it’s great that there’s support in place when customers have questions about switching formulas.” As registered dietitians, Bourgeois and I rated the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. Bourgeois states, “I like that the protein powders are unsweetened and free from artificial ingredients and that Gainful offers a personalized protein powder formula.” The USDA recommends limiting added sugar intake to less than 10% of your daily calorie intake, so this powder can help you toward that goal. ( 8 ) While this powder is pricier, its benefits might be worth it for a plant-based keto dieter. Read our full Gainful Protein Powder Review . A grass-fed whey isolate includes added ingredients for digestion like seven digestive enzymes and a probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus). It's also gluten-free, sugar-free, and soy-free. Out of the whey protein options out there, whey protein isolate (like the protein source found in Onnit Grass-Fed Protein) is excellent since it’s highly digestible. ( 5 ) It’s a lean whey protein powder with 20 grams of protein and a complete amino acid profile to help build muscle. ( 11 ) Moreover, the isolate in this formulation is non-GMO and derived from Irish, grass-fed cows that graze an average of 250 days a year. For those who prefer more natural options, grass-fed options like Onnit Grass-Fed Protein or the best organic protein powders would work best. Those who are looking for lactose-free options can also take Onnit since whey isolate is virtually lactose-free – although it does contain milk proteins. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D., L.D.N., rated the formulation a 4.5 out of 5 and agrees that it’s an excellent whey option for keto diets. She states, “I like the macronutrient ratio that Onnit Whey Protein provides – 20 grams of protein, around 2 grams of fat, and 3 to 4 grams of carbs. And I like that Onnit includes an enzyme blend in their ingredients to help promote good digestion.” It also contains probiotics like Lactobacillus Acidophilus for digestive support. ( 12 ) As a registered dietitian, I wish it would have more than 20 grams of protein, although it may work for a strict keto diet that doesn’t call for a lot of protein. While most people can get away with consuming only 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram per day, some athletes need up to 1.6 grams of protein per day, so 20 grams might not be sufficient to meet their daily protein needs. ( 8 )( 13 ) This pick also mixes fairly well – it’s rated a 5 out of 5 for solubility. Our tester, who is a certified personal trainer, states, “ I had no issues regarding solubility, but the texture is thinner than other proteins, especially when mixed with water. There were no clumps or ‘floaties’ to speak of.” If you prefer protein shakes with thicker textures, you may want to add it to whole milk or oat milk for extra creaminess. However, if you’re a flavor enthusiast, you may want to look elsewhere for a protein that offers more variety. This protein powder is only available in two flavors – vanilla and chocolate – so it won’t satisfy a pickier palate. “ I sampled the Mexican Chocolate variety and found the flavor to be pretty good and decadent when mixed with a milk product,” our tester adds, rating the product a 3.75 out of 5. Overall, for a clean whey option that promotes good digestion and offers excellent solubility, try Onnit Grass-Fed Protein. Read our full Onnit Grass-Fed Protein Review . Sports Research Organic Collagen Peptides is great in your morning coffee or in a smoothie, thanks to its fantastic absorption. It offers 11 grams of Types 1 and III collagens as well as 18 amino acids. Sports Research Collagen Peptides provides an impressive amino acid profile with 11 grams of collagen peptides per serving. It’s clean and boasts a simple ingredient list, making it one of the best dairy-free protein powders (since collagen is a building block for connective tissue and not a dairy product). Our product tester, a former Olympian, tried this pick with both water and coffee and enjoyed it. They rated the taste a 5 out of 5 and the solubility a 5 out of 5. They state, “ With water, you could tell there was an additive, but the overall taste wasn’t off-putting or overly strong.” They also noted that it mixes easily in a shaker bottle without sticking or ‘floaties.’ “I did have some foam at the top of the mixture. I also successfully added this to hot coffee, blending the powder easily with a spoon. The end results don’t have any gritty texture, but the brand does have a warning label that residue can form if you blend the powder with a colder beverage,” our tester adds. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D., L.D.N., also tried the product and was a big fan of the formulation. She gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5. She states, “I like that Sports Research only uses one ingredient in their collagen: hydrolyzed bovine collagen peptides. Hydrolyzed peptides are said to be easier to digest and utilize.” With no net carbs or sugar, this formulation is easy to incorporate into a keto diet and could support your body in many ways. “This formulation can also support healthy skin, hair, joints, and nails, along with muscle recovery,” Bourgeois adds. However, if you’re looking for more protein in your collagen supplement, consider a whey or one of the best casein proteins that contain more protein per serving. The serving size is also small at 11 grams per serving. Most collagen supplements tend to be lower in protein content, though, so it’s not unusual to see – they often come in small packets and not bigger scoops. Overall, these aren’t too big of a downside if collagen is your protein source choice – and this pick is as clean as collagen gets and one of the best collagen peptide supplements out there. While different versions of the keto diet can vary, the typical macronutrient distribution of the keto diet consists of 55 to 60% fat, 30 to 35% protein, and 5 to 10% carbohydrates. ( 2 ) While this is a tough diet to follow, the best keto protein powders help you adhere to these macros while offering health benefits for athletes. Read on to learn more about protein powder benefits when incorporated into your keto diet. Keto protein powders typically cost from $0.62 for the most economical option to $3.21 for a more premium option, depending on the brand, ingredients, and quality. For example, premium options with added benefits like medium-chain triglyceride oil or digestive enzymes can cost more. For a fair comparison, look at the cost per serving and evaluate the amount of protein and scoops each serving contains. We’ve provided cost comparisons based on cost per serving. When buying a keto protein powder that isn’t on our list of picks, be sure to consider factors like macronutrient content, micronutrient content, ingredient quality, and protein source to find a product that fits within appropriate nutrition for athletes . A keto diet is low carbohydrate, high fat, and moderate protein. When adhering to this dietary pattern, your body uses fats to produce ketones to use for energy instead of carbs and keep your body in ketosis. ( 2 ) A good keto protein powder should be high in fat to support this diet. Or, since most protein powders are blended into shakes, it should show potential to serve as a good base for bulking up with other fats like nut butter, coconut oil, or MCT oil. The total number of net carbs to consume daily depends on the variety of keto diet you’re following. However, all varieties promote a low-carb diet with as few grams of carbohydrates as possible. ( 2 ) The best low-carb protein powders should contain less than 5 grams of net carbs on the label – you can calculate net carbs by taking the total carbs and subtracting the dietary fiber content and half of the sugar alcohol content (if applicable). While the keto diet can support wellness and various health benefits, it can also cause digestive discomfort like constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. ( 2 ) To help mitigate potential digestive issues, consider looking for a protein powder containing probiotics, prebiotics, or digestive enzymes to help support your gut health. Moreover, look for a powder with higher fiber content or blend with fruits and veggies into a smoothie to help you stay regular. ( 14 ) The keto diet is pretty restrictive, so if not appropriately managed, it can often result in nutrient deficiencies like vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. ( 15 ) As a registered dietitian, I typically recommend that my keto clients take a multivitamin or look for a protein powder supplement that provides higher daily values of micronutrients to prevent any nutrient deficiencies. While on keto, you should also get your bloodwork checked regularly. Check the nutrition label for the protein source and ensure it contains a wide range of essential amino acids to support muscle growth. Depending on your dietary preferences, allergies, intolerances, and goals, you may want to opt for a specific protein source. For example, if you prefer a slower digesting protein, you may want to try a casein protein, egg white protein, or one of the best whey isolates . Or, if you prefer plant-based sources, try a pea blend or pumpkin seed protein. Try to look for a protein powder that uses high-quality, natural ingredients – the ingredient list on the label should be short, simple, and free from artificial flavors or sweeteners, low-grade fillers, or preservatives. Studies show that eating a healthy diet consisting of primarily plant-based foods, low-sugar, and limited processed foods is positively correlated with “good” bacteria in the gut, which can help reduce the risk for chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. ( 16 ) While the keto diet consists of only “moderate” protein intake, protein powder can be beneficial for athletes who struggle to meet their daily protein needs from food alone. Consuming moderate protein intake through protein powders can help athletes maintain or gain muscle while staying in ketosis. The best keto protein powder depends on your specific needs and goals, but good choices on a keto diet typically include a high-quality protein source, moderate protein content, low net carbs, added fats (or ones where you can seamlessly add fats to it), and a clean ingredient list. We think Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is a solid keto protein powder choice for general wellness since it offers great macros for keto, helps ingredients that fight off keto flu symptoms, and ranks highly in independent third-party testing. At the low end of the range, whey-based keto protein powders can cost from $0.88 per serving, while collagen-based keto powders start at $0.62. More premium options at the high end of the range can cost up to $3.21 per serving, depending on the product’s ingredients, brand, and nutritional profile. Be sure to compare costs per serving for an accurate comparison since protein powders can have different serving sizes. For example, one product could have one scoop per serving, while another could have two.

    "text": "Weight loss can be tricky, and what works for one person might not work for another. It may take some trial and error, but implementing weight loss supplements along with the best weight loss programs may help speed up the process. “ Sustainable weight loss requires a holistic approach that often entails several lifestyle changes ,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD , a registered dietitian nutritionist who assisted BarBend with this guide. “ While dietary supplements can support your efforts, nothing takes the place of a well-balanced diet, regular physical activity, and adequate sleep. ” Protein powders, pre-workouts, and multivitamins all have ingredients that might help with stubborn weight loss, but they’re definitely not magic solutions. “There’s no one right supplement for weight loss — since people go about losing weight in different ways, a variety of supplements can help folks lose the last few stubborn pounds,” adds Bourgeois. “But ultimately, any supplement that you choose to help with weight loss should be cost-effective, backed by scientific evidence, and easy to incorporate into a daily routine.” Here are our picks for the best supplements for weight loss.

Onnit Total Human is a multivitamin supplement that comes in individual packets of supplements for each day and night. Each packet includes an array of supps, from a B complex to antioxidants and even spirulina. Onnit Total Human stands out from the typical multivitamins that cram nutrients into one or two pills. Instead, it offers vitamin packs with multiple pills designed to optimize key areas of health that support weight loss. Each daily serving includes a day pack and a night pack, with eight capsules in each. “A multivitamin can support weight management efforts in more ways than one, and Onnit Total Human has pretty much everything you need in one place,” explains Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. “It contains vitamins and minerals that support energy production (hello, powerful workouts), better sleep (decreased oxidative stress), and improved metabolism (getting that calorie burn on).” Simply put, more energy supports an active lifestyle, while better sleep health has been shown to correspond with increased metabolism and with weight and fat loss. ( 5 )( 18 ) Simply put, more energy supports an active lifestyle, while better sleep health has been shown to correspond with weight and fat loss. ( 5 ) Total Human vitamin packs are filled with Onnit’s patented supplements, including Alpha BRAIN, Stron BONE, and VIRU Tech. The day pack contains nootropics, strontium, boron, and antioxidants to reduce inflammation, improve mental clarity, and support bone health. It’s also packed with B vitamins, which studies show are essential for reducing fatigue and cognitive dysfunction ( 6 ). The night pack features magnesium, selenium, and zinc, which support recovery and relaxation. ( 19 ) It also contains Valerian root, which may improve sleep quality and alleviate symptoms of anxiety. ( 7 ) “The blend of vitamins and minerals can support weight loss by ensuring you meet your daily nutrient needs to keep your systems running at optimal levels,” says Bourgeois, who scores Total Human a 4.5 out of 5. It’s no wonder we named it one of the best multivitamins . The half point, Bourgeois notes, was deducted due to some of the dosages being hidden behind proprietary blends. “ Also ,” she continues, “it doesn’t take individualized needs into account. Men and women have different nutrient needs that vary based on many factors.” Our tester, a USA Weightlifting coach, was also a fan of Total Human. “I’ve been taking these for around 20 days, and I’ve seen results from the daytime pills, specifically, with a lot less brain fog and an altogether clearer head,” they said. “As for the night pills, well, they’ve given me some weird dreams, but I’ve slept through the night every time I’ve taken them.” The downside for our tester is the sheer amount of capsules you take each day. “This is a LOT of pills for morning and for night,” they say. “Be ready to do a lot of swallowing! It’s eight pills in the day pack, and eight at night. I can swallow the entire pack in one gulp, but other people may want to break it up because it is a lot! ” Swallowability scores a 3 out of 5. If you’d rather not gulp down so many capsules each night, check out Transparent Labs Multivitamin (four capsules) or Nutricost Multivitamin (two capsules). Read our full Onnit Total Human Review . This formula is 100 percent New Zealand Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate with 25 grams of protein per serving. It includes no hormones, antibiotics or pesticides and comes in four delicious flavors --- Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, and Peanut Butter. Increasing your protein intake with a high-quality protein powder is a great way to support long-term weight loss. XWERKS Grow provides up to 25 grams of protein per serving, which can help boost metabolism and reduce the likelihood of overeating. ( 20 ) “Research continues to point to high-protein intake as a sustainable weight management method,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. “It helps increase energy expenditure, promote satiety between meals, and decrease lean muscle loss. ( 8 ) XWERKS Grow, a super lean protein powder, can be an asset to a well-balanced high-protein diet.” Although packed with protein, each serving only contains 110 calories with 1 to 3 grams of carbohydrates and 0 to 2 grams of fat depending on the flavor. This allows you to increase your protein intake without skewing your other macros or overconsuming calories. With its high protein and low calorie content this makes XWERKS one of the best protein powders for weight loss the market. Unlike most protein powders, XWERKS Grow is packed with micronutrients like iron, calcium, and vitamins A, C, and D, which support vision, bone health, muscle function, and a strong immune system. It also contains 6 grams of BCAAs, which studies show can promote muscle growth and assist with post-exercise recovery. ( 9 ) Maintaining and building muscle helps with weight loss, as muscle mass burns more calories than fat. “When it comes to weight loss, I like to prioritize adding foods that support weight management rather than restriction,” says Bourgeois. “Research continues to highlight high-protein diets for weight loss and I think XWERKS Grow can be a great way to boost overall protein intake without excessive calories. Plus, I love that you get 6 grams of BCAAs to support muscle growth to help with lean body composition.” Overall, she scores its formulation a 4.5 out of 5. Furthermore, our tester rates both its taste a 5 out of 5. “I tried the chocolate flavor and it was kind of like drinking a protein Yoo-hoo, ” they say. “I’m surprised at how smooth it is.” Solubility also gets a 5 out of 5. “ Mixing isn’t really an issue at all — I barely needed a blender ball ,” they say. However, the flavor options are limited with only four choices available. Each serving costs $1.96, leading our tester to rate this category a 3.5 out of 5. If you’re in the market for a budget protein supp, we recommend offerings from Nutricost and Jacked Factory. Read our full XWERKS Grow Review . Third-party tested and clearly dosed, Transparent Labs LEAN has a huge variety of ingredients for endurance, power, alertness, and focus. Weight loss typically involves a mix of healthy eating and regular physical activity. A good pre-workout can boost your workouts and maximize calorie burning. Transparent Labs LEAN is packed with ingredients designed to help you feel energized, focused, and strong, so you can power through your next training session. “Physical activity is a major factor in sustainable weight loss, and Transparent Labs LEAN can put a pep in your step before hitting the gym,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. Its formulation combines some of the best pre-workout ingredients — citrulline malate, beta-alanine, betaine, and caffeine — with acetyl-l-carnitine, chromium picolinate, and zinc, a combo that can potentially improve metabolism and promote weight loss. ( 10 )( 11 )( 12 )( 13 ) Bourgeois was impressed by LEAN’s 6 grams of citrulline malate, a nitric oxide enhancer. Nitric oxide improves blood flow and enhances nutrient and oxygen delivery to muscles. “Improved blood flow can help you make the most of your workouts, supporting weight loss efforts. Plus, citrulline may help improve physical function and muscle strength, and 6 grams is a clinically-based dose.” ( 14 ) Additionally, it contains several micronutrients that aren’t always found in other pre-workouts. “I’m also a fan of its vitamin and mineral profile,” says Bourgeois. “You’re getting a hefty dose of zinc, copper, selenium, and iodine with every scoop. Plus, it’s third-party tested and Informed-Choice certified.” Kate Meier, an Olympic weightlifter and BarBend editorial member, used LEAN before her workouts three to four times a week for three weeks, focusing on Olympic lifting and strength training. “Previously, I was using Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Pre-Workout, but I would say the energy boost and focus I’ve gotten from LEAN has been more noticeable,” she says. They score their workout experience a 4 out of 5. While they didn’t experience any tingles from the beta-alanine, the caffeine dose resonated. “I’d say it left me a bit jittery.” Bourgeois also noted the caffeine content. “Each scoop contains 180 milligrams of caffeine, which is around the same amount as two cups of coffee. Efforts to lose weight should not come with unwanted side effects, so if you’re sensitive to caffeine, you might search for a different pre-workout.” If you’re sensitive to caffeine but in the market for a pre-workout, check out our picks for the best non-stim pre-workouts , which includes offerings from Legion, Nutricost, and Gainful. Overall, Bourgeois rates the formulation 4 out of 5, noting that she loves the citrulline dose. However, the 2 grams of beta-alanine and 1.5 grams of betaine fall below the typical recommended doses of 3.2 grams and 2.5 grams, respectively.( 15 ) Read our full Transparent Labs LEAN Review . Get your greens on with KOS Greens Powder which can potentially help promote alkalinity, digestion support, and provide a much-needed greens blend. A light and refreshing Green Apple Sorbet flavor won’t leave you dreading this drink or plugging your nose. Show Me the Greens, a vegan greens powder made with all-natural ingredients, is great for filling potential nutrient gaps. It contains vitamins, minerals, fiber, antioxidants, superfoods, and prebiotics. Each serving has only 30 calories and 1 gram of sugar. Our tester rated its formulation 4 out of 5. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, appreciates Show Me the Greens for its potential to support gut health. “The GI microbiome may be a major factor affecting energy balance and metabolism, ultimately contributing to weight management efforts, ” she says. “Show Me the Greens Powder aims to support a healthy gut.” That support comes from the fiber-rich prebiotic blend, which nourishes beneficial gut bacteria. ( 16 ) “With ingredients like spirulina, chlorella, and acacia gum, the supplement can help support immune and gut health,” adds Bourgeois . “And since we know that a healthy gut supports overall health and weight management, this product is intriguing.” ( 17 ) Unfortunately, many of this powder’s ingredients are part of proprietary blends. “I’m usually pretty hesitant with products that contain proprietary blends because I like to know exactly what and how much of it I’m consuming,” adds Bourgeois , who rates this formulation a 3.5 out of 5. If proprietary blends give you pause, check out the Legion and Transparent Labs offerings on our list of the best greens powders . Research on the impact of greens powders on weight loss is quite limited. However, improving nutrient intake is generally beneficial for overall wellbeing. For those seeking clean nutrition, Show Me the Greens is certified organic, non-GMO, and manufactured in an NSF-certified facility. We love its low cost at just $0.83 per serving. Show Me the Greens is one of the more budget-friendly greens powders on the market and your purchase comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. “Compared to other options on the market, it’s a cost-effective formula,” says Bourgeois. Show Me the Greens is only available in one flavor, Green Apple Sorbet. Thankfully, our tester mostly likes the taste. “The powder tastes like green apple but has an earthy aftertaste,” they said, scoring the taste a 4 out of 5. “ It’s drinkable and I can finish the whole serving but I can still tell it’s a greens powder. It would be perfect if it were a little sweeter.” Solubility also scores a 4 out of 5. “I experienced a little grit during my sips, but nothing disqualifying.” Read our full KOS Show Me the Greens Review . Momentous L-Carnitine provides about 500mg of carnitine per serving with no added fillers or ingredients. You can buy this bottle for $25.95, which comes to only about $0.43 per serving. Acetyl l-carnitine moves fatty acids into the mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cells, where they are converted into energy. It may help promote fat oxidation and assist with fat burning during exercise and periods of weight loss. ( 10 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, rates Momentous Acetyl L-Carnitine, one of the best carnitine supplements on the market, a 4.5 out of 5, noting its concentrated 500-milligram dose of acetyl-L-carnitine and lack of unnecessary additives and fillers. “Acetyl-L carnitine is a naturally-occurring amino acid that has been linked to energy production and brain function — two important factors in weight loss,” says Bourgeois . ( 22 ) “Carnitine helps preserve muscle glycogen and promotes fat oxidation, supporting your efforts in the gym so you work towards building fat-free mass,” she explains. But that’s not all. According to research, acetyl-l carnitine may improve VO2 max and speed up recovery, allowing you to train harder and more efficiently. ( 21 ) The amplified endurance could help you scorch more calories at the gym. Bourgeois does note, however, that “the liver and kidneys typically synthesize sufficient amounts of carnitine to meet daily needs.” She adds, “There is currently no standardized recommended intake, so it’s difficult to say if the 500-milligram dose of Momentous Acetyl-L Carnitine will make a huge impact on your weight loss journey.” It’s important to add, too, that the long-term cardiovascular effects of carnitine supplementation need additional research. ( 30 ) If you’d rather not add yet another supplement to your regimen, you can also find carnitine in more comprehensive formulations, such as Legion Recharge , a popular post-workout supplement. Ritual Synbiotic+ offers pre-, pro-, and postbiotics in a fiber capsule that keeps the probiotic tablet intact until it reaches the colon, where the probiotics can do the most good. Probiotics are beneficial gut bacteria that help balance the microbiome, improving digestion, immunity, and overall gut health . Prebiotics nourish probiotics, enhancing their effectiveness. Postbiotics are produced when probiotics digest prebiotics. ( 39 ) Ritual Synbiotic+ includes all three. “Probiotics can support a healthy gut when included in a well-balanced lifestyle, but Ritual Synbiotic takes it a step further by ensuring their probiotics reach the colon,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. “A healthy intestinal barrier is responsible for the uptake of essential nutrients, an important consideration when pursuing weight loss.” ( 23 ) This daily pill comes in a delayed-release capsule designed to reach the colon, where its clinically-studied prebiotics (PreforPro), probiotics (BB-12 & LGG), and postbiotics (Tributyrin) are most effective. Each of these may offer better gut health, improved bowel function, and relief from gas, bloating, and diarrhea, resulting in a healthy intestinal barrier. ( 24 )( 25 )( 26 )( 27 ) “A healthy intestinal barrier is essential for absorbing nutrients and keeping your immune system operating at full capacity, both important for sustainable weight loss,” adds Bourgeois. One of our testers, a certified personal trainer and nutrition coach, rates the taste of Synbiotic+ a 4.5 out of 5. “ I really love that there is a slight mint aroma and taste to these pills! ” they say. Swallowability, meanwhile, scores a 5 out of 5. “I love that Ritual is transparent about its supply chain and manufacturing process,” says Sadie Albert, an NCI-certified nutrition coach, after researching Synbiotic+ for BarBend . “Plus, they are a Certified B Corp, meaning they meet the rigorous standards for social and environmental performance and are actively creating a positive impact on a micro and macro level. “ Bourgeois, meanwhile, rates its formulation at a 4 out of 5, noting the product’s proprietary blends. “You can’t be sure exactly how much of each strain of bacteria you’re consuming,” she says. Price is also a consideration. Ritual Synbiotic+ costs a hefty $1.44 per serving. There are plenty of probiotic supplements on the market for less than $1 per serving. Hum Gut Instinct and Sports Research Daily Probiotics, for example, are much more affordable. “I’m a big supporter of prioritizing whole foods, so there are definitely less-expensive ways to consume gut-friendly bacteria, ” says Bourgeois. Lifeforce Vitamin D+K delivers 60 micrograms of Vitamin D (300 percent of your recommended daily intake) and 300 micrograms of vitamin K (250 percent of your recommended daily intake). The two vitamins work synergistically to improve bone and heart health. Many people know vitamins D and K support bone health, but mounting research suggests these essential vitamins may also influence body weight. Lifeforce Vitamin D+K provides 60 micrograms of Vitamin D (300 percent of the recommended daily intake) and 300 micrograms of vitamin K (250 percent of the recommended daily intake). ( 40 )( 41 ) “Vitamin D levels have been linked to body mass index (BMI), indicating that vitamin D supplementation may support weight management efforts,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. She rates Lifeforce Vitamin D+K a 4.75 out of 5, noting that these two vitamins work together to enhance bone health, brain health, and potentially influence body weight. “I like that Lifeforce combines vitamins D and K in this supplement,” she says. “They’re both fat-soluble vitamins that work synergistically to play key roles in bone and heart health. If your weight loss journey includes increased physical activity, it’s important to be mindful of your bone and cardiovascular health.” ( 28 ) Vitamin D serves many important purposes in the body, including aiding in nutrient absorption, maintaining bone density, promoting adequate immune function, and fighting inflammation . Vitamin D has also been shown to be essential for optimal metabolic functions, and some studies suggest it plays a role in weight loss, although more research is needed. Vitamin D deficiency is strongly associated with obesity, as vitamin D is often sequestered in fat tissue, making it less readily available for the body to use. ( 29 )( 42 )( 43 ) While the body produces vitamin D from sunlight exposure, many people don’t get enough sun to meet their needs. Fortified foods like milk, orange juice, and cereal, along with vitamin D supplements, can help ensure adequate levels. ( 44 ) [Related: Benefits of Vitamin D ] It’s worth noting that the vitamin D in this formula is cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). “Because D3 is sourced from animals, this supplement isn’t vegan-friendly,” says Bourgeois. “Those who want to boost their vitamin D intake but follow a vegan lifestyle should look for vitamin D2 instead.” Dr. Jennie Stanford, M.D., FAAFP, DipABOM, points out, “ Newer, less-studied, plant-based vitamin D3 supplements are becoming increasingly available. More research is needed to understand their absorption and effectiveness .” These capsules feature a liposomal delivery system, which has been shown to enhance absorption and bioavailability to more quickly optimize vitamin D levels. ( 31 ) This likely contributes to the higher price tag of $1.00 per serving, which is roughly twice the cost of other vitamin D and K supplements. A high-potency, molecularly distilled fish oil with additional vitamin E and lemon oil, this supplement from Legion meets stringent purity standards and is sourced from sustainable fisheries. Fish oil is celebrated for its impressive benefits, especially for your heart and brain. Packed with omega-3 fatty acids , it helps reduce inflammation, lower triglycerides, and protect against cognitive decline. ( 32 ) But its perks don’t stop there – these powerful fats help optimize your metabolism and support your weight loss journey. “Legion Triton Fish Oil contains evidence-based doses of EPA and DHA and an impressive dose of vitamin E. It is sourced responsibly and is free from artificial dyes and other chemicals, says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN LD. She rated the formulation a 4.75 out of 5. The re-esterified triglyceride form of fish oil in this product delivers higher concentrations of EPA and DHA compared to natural fish oil and also offers superior bioavailability for better absorption and effectiveness. ( 33 )( 45 ) Furthermore, obesity and inflammation are closely connected. The added vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant, helps combat inflammation, which may support improved metabolic health and weight loss efforts. ( 34 ) “ Omega-3 fatty acids truly are powerhouses in terms of improving our health,” says Dr. Jennie Stanford, M.D., FAAFP, DipABOM . “Their powerful anti-inflammatory properties not only reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, but they also promote optimal cellular functioning for metabolism and fat modulation.” Regarding weight loss, omega-3 fatty acids may enhance fat burning, boost metabolism, and improve satiety to help curb cravings. ( 35 ) Other studies suggest they may help reduce abdominal fat when used as part of a weight loss regimen. ( 36 )( 37 ) More research is needed to validate these findings. That’s all great, but you may still get the burps associated with fish oil supplements. Our tester, a certified personal trainer, did. “They’re not as bad as other fish oil burps I’ve endured, but you’re still burpin’,” they say. As for taste, they give Triton a 4.5 out of 5. “There’s the slightest fish oil taste, but that’s to be expected.” Ease of use scores a 4 out of 5, with our tester noting the amount of capsules you need to take her serving. “My only real complaint is that you have to take four capsules. That’s no fun.” If you’re also uncomfortable swallowing so many pills, you may prefer the single softgel of Sports Research Omega-3 Krill Oil, one of the best krill oil supplements we’ve tested. BarBend ’s team of fitness professionals includes certified personal trainers, nutrition coaches, and fitness fanatics. In addition to testing nearly every type of fitness equipment on the market, we’ve also dipped scoops into more than 100 of the best protein powders , more than 70 of the best pre-workout supplements , and dozens upon dozens of additional supplements, from multivitamins to probiotics. Using our supplement testing methodology , we rated each product on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) in a variety of categories, including the efficacy of its formulation, the side effects we experienced, and its overall value. We never recommend weight loss supplements that promise rapid and drastic results, as these claims are often misleading and can be harmful to your health. Sustainable weight loss requires time, consistency, and a balanced approach. “I am not a fan of supplements that purposefully stifle your appetite or block nutrient absorption,” says registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. “It’s important to listen to and honor your hunger cues when pursuing sustainable weight loss, and blocking nutrient absorption puts you at risk for long-term complications.” We encourage anyone aiming to lose weight to avoid over-the-counter appetite suppressants, fat burners, and diet pills, including the off-label use of prescription medications like Ozempic, Wegovy, and Orlistat (these should only be used under the guidance of a physician). Furthermore, if a substance is banned in dietary supplements or medications — like ephedra or clenbuterol — it’s best to steer clear. According to the National Institutes of Health, many common ingredients in weight loss dietary supplements can lead to adverse effects, some of which can be serious. ( 38 ) See a handful of examples below. It’s important to use supplements containing these ingredients responsibly, as these side effects may occur when taken in excess or with certain medical conditions. Consult your healthcare provider before starting a new supplement to monitor for side effects and ensure it’s safe for you. Supplements designed to support weight loss come with a range of price tags. Our list features various supplement types, including protein powders, greens powders, and pre-workouts, with prices typically ranging from $0.50 to $5.00 per serving. [Related: Best Multivitamins for Women ] There are a variety of things to think about when choosing the best supplements for weight loss. Consider how these supplements can support your weight loss plans, but keep in mind that they won’t provide a quick fix. Your personal goals, expectations, and health concerns should be considered before choosing a product. There’s a lot more to weight loss than just diet and exercise, and health concerns can play a major role in how quickly or slowly weight loss is achievable. Some medical conditions make losing weight harder, while others cause unintentional weight loss. Certain supplements may also interact with medications or exacerbate health issues. It’s important to consult with a healthcare provider, such as a doctor or registered dietitian, before starting a new supplement to ensure it’s safe for you. “It’s never too early to seek medical guidance on your weight loss journey,” says registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. “A qualified healthcare professional can be a great support during times of physical and mental transformation. Sustainable weight loss often requires a change in our relationship with food, and a registered dietitian can help you navigate those changes safely.” When aiming to lose weight, having a clear plan is essential. Setting specific goals can keep you motivated and help you choose the right supplements. If you’re focusing on weight lifting to boost metabolism, a protein powder can aid in muscle maintenance and growth. If your goal is to fill nutrient gaps, a greens powder could be a good option. Ideally, combining exercise, healthy eating, quality sleep, and stress management will set you on the path to a healthier lifestyle and support your weight loss efforts. The diet industry can be misleading, with commercials and ads constantly promoting quick-fix weight loss trends, diets, and pills. In reality, sustainable weight loss takes time and effort. A safe and healthy goal is losing 1-2 pounds per week. Rapid weight loss through extreme measures often leads to regaining the weight—and sometimes more— which can be harmful to your health. Choose supplements to supplement your efforts, but don’t expect them to zap fat. It could take weeks or even months to see results. The important thing is to be consistent. “Remember that your worth is not determined by the number on the scale,” says Bourgeois. “Approach your weight loss journey with a mindset focused on overall health, and you’ll be more likely to see sustainable results. And don’t be afraid to rely on the help of certified personal trainers and registered dietitians.” “There’s no one right supplement for weight loss — since people go about losing weight in different ways, a variety of supplements can help folks lose the last few stubborn pounds,” says registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “But ultimately, any supplement that you choose to help with weight loss should be cost-effective, backed by scientific evidence, and easy to incorporate into a daily routine.” Supplements for weight loss generally cost anywhere from $0.50  to nearly $5.00 per serving, depending on the product type, brand, ingredients, dosages, and serving size. Those with more ingredients or third-party testing typically cost more than single-ingredient supplements. Some brands may offer subscription options or bulk purchase discounts. Weight loss supplements are not the key to losing belly fat . However, supplements may compliment a weight loss plan when combined with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and plenty of sleep. Supplements like probiotics, protein powders, and multivitamins can help give you the energy and focus to power through a slight calorie deficit and workout regimen. Knapen, M. H. J., Jardon, K.

    "text": "Even if you’re mixing up one of the best protein powders each morning, adjusting your diet can still be necessary to build muscle mass. To gain weight, you need to be in a calorie surplus — consuming more calories than you burn. For some, though, beefing up your meals can take a toll on your digestive system. World-renowned bodybuilder, powerlifter, and nutrition coach Stan Efferding believes he’s developed a solution to this problem: the Vertical Diet. Efferding’s approach aims to aid in food digestion and correct micronutrient deficiencies. The Vertical Diet has begun to trickle into the mainstream, attracting attention from outside the bodybuilding community. But is the Vertical Diet right for the average gymgoer? Read on to see what our team of registered dietitians and nutrition coaches have to say about this popular regimen. The vertical in Vertical Diet simply refers to how it’s laid out — like an upside-down T. As our expert reviewer Kathleen Benson lays out, the plan itself serves two main purposes. “ The Vertical Diet is a nutritional plan focused on reducing negative digestive health symptoms, while enhancing sports performance,” she says. At the base of the upside-down T, you’ll find foods that Benson says can provide key micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) for organ health, hormone regulation, and more. “It prioritizes nutrient-dense foods , including red meat , low-lactose dairy foods, and white rice .” The top of the graph highlights two important foods Benson mentions: red meat and white rice. For anyone concerned about how to count macros , these two staples are replete with protein, carbohydrates, and fats. The amount you eat depends on your strength and physique goals. Why red meat and white rice? Efferding says those foods are the best way to get as many calories as possible without disrupting the body’s digestion system. And the rest of your foods — found at the bottom — can help aid digestion and other bodily functions. “In short, the Vertical Diet is about eating nutrient-dense foods that are easily digestible to help you lose or gain weight , maximize workouts, and achieve better nutrient absorption overall,” he explains. “The goal is to keep the main focus on micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants.” As Benson notes, all the foods picked by Efferding are low-FODMAP foods. “[ The Vertical Diet ] eliminates foods high in FODMAPs, which can be nutrient -dense but may cause digestive issues.” Sorry, vegans, but red meat and white rice are on the menu. Because it’s so easily digestible and has practically no fiber, fat, or antinutrients, white rice is as clean a carb as they come. ( 1 ) Brown rice is off the menu because it contains a lot of “antinutrients,” which are said to be compounds that reduce the body’s ability to absorb essential nutrients (more on those later). ( 2 ) Red meat is Efferding’s high-protein food of choice because he considers it the most nutrient-dense kind of meat. “[Red meat is] loaded with heme iron, B-vitamins, zinc, magnesium, creatine, and healthy fats.” It’s worth noting that, though, dietitians and nutritionists in recent years have called on people to reduce their red meat intake, as it’s been linked to increased risks of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. ( 3 ) Recent guidelines state you should cap your red meat intake at 18 ounces per week, but you’ll blow past that if you’re eating it every day. Always consult your healthcare professional before trying out the Vertical Diet, taking on any nutrition plan, or attempting to alter your body composition. ( 4 ) For those who choose to continue on this path, many of the calories will come from those two food sources alone. Sources of red meat include: Because they’re not as nutrient-dense as red meat, Efferding says to avoid white fish (like sole) and white meat (like chicken) when crafting your meal plan. Beneath the towering pillars of red meat and white rice, you’ll find a wide, flat base of fruit, potatoes, sweet potatoes, spinach, red peppers, carrots, and juice. You’ll also find some extra animal products, like butter, broth, and fatty fish. We know where Efferding lands in the matchup between brown rice vs. white rice , but our expert reviewer, Kathleen Benson, highlighted a few other items to avoid on the Vertical Diet. “Foods on the no list include brown rice, grains, legumes (beans, peas, lentils, etc.), coffee, added sugar, and high FODMAP foods like onions, garlic, broccoli, and sugar alcohols (which occur naturally in some vegetables).” Below is a quick rundown of foods to leave on the shelf. Whole grains like pasta, cereal, and bread are not part of the Vertical Diet because they contain gluten and phytic acid, which we’ll be discussing more later. Some dietitians balk at this advice, as whole grains have many essential micronutrients. Whole grains have also been linked to a lower risk of colon cancer and cardiovascular disease. ( 4 ) Oats are usually bodybuilding staples, but their concentration of antinutrients makes them a no-go for Vertical Diet followers. Like other grains, though, the consumption of oats can reduce the risk of certain diseases. ( 4 ) While legumes — like beans, soybeans, lentils, and chickpeas — are considered a source of lectins, they can result in some gas buildup. ( 5 ) They’re permitted under the Vertical Diet if they’re soaked and fermented, though. These staples of the Mediterranean diet are high in fiber and have been linked to lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease. ( 6 )( 7 ) These are super high in Omega-6 fatty acids, too many of which have been pretty strongly linked to inflammation, heart disease, and obesity. Nutritional experts have been urging people to cut back on processed oils, so it may be a good idea to cut these out even if you don’t follow the Vertical Diet.  ( 8 ) Citing research showing that coffee can cause dehydration and impairs digestion, Efferding says that saying goodbye to some pantry staples is worth it. ( 9 ) “I don’t eat foods I like. I eat foods that like me,” he says. “Getting your gut health and digestion in top shape might make you feel better than these everyday comfort staples.” The polyphenols found in coffee may help reduce the risk of cancer, but these are also readily available in fruits and vegetables. ( 10 ) Sugar alcohols are natural sweeteners like erythritol and xylitol, which are commonly used in protein bars or diet-friendly ice cream. Like grains and legumes, they may lead to indigestion in some folks. Perhaps the most controversial exclusion, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and asparagus are excluded from the Vertical Diet. Why cut these out? The culprit is raffinose, a sugar found in some veggies, grains, and legumes resistant to digestion and can sometimes cause gas. While this is true, it’s undeniable that these high-FODMAP vegetables are some of the most nutrient-dense and low- inflammation foods out there. They have also been shown to reduce cell damage and cancer risk. ( 11 ) Garlic and onions are the foundation of the tastiest, savory meals, but they’re high FODMAP foods. While your food might lack some flavor, there’s no health risk in cutting out these aromatics. Plenty of low-FODMAP foods, like fennel, celery, bell peppers, or carrots, can all be used in their place. Before committing to the Vertical Diet, it’s important to school yourself in what exactly a FODMAP food is. “The FODMAP diet is an evidence-based, short-term therapeutic approach designed to reduce digestive symptoms and support a personalized care plan,” explains our expert reviewer, Kathleen Benson. “High-FODMAP foods contain specific carbohydrates: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols.” Carbs and fibers from high-FODMAP foods pass through your system undigested, fueling your gut bacteria and producing hydrogen gas in the process. The result? Let’s just say people might be socially distancing themselves from you for a bit. As Benson explains, beginning a FODMAP-less diet like the Vertical Diet can be broken down into three phases: For some, an excess of these types of food can be more serious than just a little gas. In certain individuals, they can draw liquid into the intestines to produce diarrhea or lead to leaky gut syndrome. By eliminating high-FODMAP foods, Efferding explains, the Vertical Diet aims to support optimal digestion and provide an answer for those wondering how to prevent bloating . “Since the diet is about easily digestible macronutrients , high- FODMAP foods are either limited or prepared in a manner that reduces digestive distress,” says Efferding. “Low-gas vegetables like spinach, cucumber , bell peppers , and potatoes are better than cruciferous vegetables for increasing the positive results from the diet.” As with any change in your diet, consult with your healthcare provider or dietitian before launching any new health and wellness plan. Also, consider these potential benefits and drawbacks of the Vertical Diet. Efferding developed the Vertical Diet with two clear goals: to aid digestion and address micronutrient deficiencies. BarBend expert reviewer Kathleen Benson agrees that it can offer some relief for those with digestion issues, but perhaps only in the short term. “The FODMAP diet is a therapeutic diet, meant to reduce digestive symptoms, and help healthcare providers determine the best course of action,” she says. One study has shown that low-FODMAP foods may reduce exercise-related gastrointestinal symptoms. ( 12 ) That might be great news when you’re straining to get in one more deadlift , but as a long-term strategy? “It is not meant as a long-term approach to addressing digestive symptoms,” Benson adds. “It’s a therapeutic tool to identify and manage the root causes of some digestive issues, such as microbiome dysbiosis.” An indirect benefit of following the Vertical Diet could also be revealing a previously unknown issue with your gut health. “Sometimes microbiome dysbiosis, or imbalance, can be the cause of gas and bloating experienced after eating garlic or onion,” says Benson. “A nutrition professional trained in the FODMAP diet, might then aim to balance the microbiome for the client to be able to consume garlic and onion down the line.” While research suggests that eating low-FODMAP foods can be good for people with conditions like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, it’s uncertain if it’s a good approach for the general public. Studies suggest that low-FODMAP lifestyles can result in nutrient deficiencies (because you’re eliminating so many foods) and altered gut bacteria, which can lead to other gastrointestinal issues. ( 13 )( 14 ) “While taking high FODMAP foods out can help reduce or eliminate digestive symptoms, it doesn’t address the root cause as to why those symptoms are being experienced,” Benson says. She also notes that cutting too many high-fiber foods can have its own impact on digestion. “Long-term avoidance of fiber- rich foods can negatively impact the microbiome… in the digestive system. While short-term elimination is often part of the plan of care, it’s not recommended to avoid these foods long-term.” Before starting the Vertical Diet, it’s a good idea to have a grasp of antinutrients. Lectin (a naturally-occurring protein) and phytic acid (a natural plant antioxidant) are two such compounds that bind to and impair the digestion of minerals like magnesium, iron, and zinc. ( 15 )( 16 ) Remember, the point of the Vertical Diet is to eat foods that are chock full of micronutrients. So, wouldn’t it make sense to avoid anything preventing those vitamins and minerals being absorbed by the body? Well, not exactly. Both of these compounds also have health benefits. Lectin has been linked to lower cancer risks, while phytic acid has been associated with lower risks of cardiovascular disease and kidney stones. Some people even take it as a supplement. ( 16 )( 15 ) Many antinutrient studies also have one problem. They isolate the compound, then study its effect on the body in their pure form by observing their interaction with certain cells. But that’s not how our bodies work — lectin is often ingested alongside things like Vitamin C, which can counter the compound’s negative effects. ( 17 ) The Vertical Diet does allow for foods high in these “antinutrients” to be consumed, but only if they’re soaked and fermented, which helps to reduce the potential negative effects of these compounds. The Vertical Diet is generally a low-fat eating regimen and can be tailored to a high- or low-carb plan by adjusting the amount of food you eat. The total amount of calories you’ll eat per day depend on your basal metabolic rate and your workload, but the basic macronutrient profile looks something like this: To figure out your daily caloric needs, you’ll first have to figure out your basal metabolic rate — that’s the number of calories you burn just to live or maintain your weight. This can be figured out in a lab, but that’s expensive and time-consuming. If you’re looking to lose weight, the only way is to remain in a calorie deficit. In our piece on how to gain muscle , we wrote that you’ll want to consume more than you expend — but not by much. “On average, you want to be eating just 200 calories (so, less than a pack of skittles) above your total daily energy expenditure (how many calories you burn in a day),” reads the piece. “Eating any more might lead to the fat gain you are trying to avoid,” it continues. “If you’re still having trouble gaining muscle — and your workout routine and sleep are on point — try adding 100 calories.” Efferding’s system speaks for itself when you look at the people who utilize it. That said, these are people who are under constant supervision by some of the greatest minds in the sports nutrition world. Because it’s focused on helping food digest as efficiently as possible, it’s easy to see why its biggest followers are strongmen and powerlifters who consume up to 12,000 calories per day. With that kind of volume, high-FODMAP, high-fiber, and high-fat foods — all off the table for Vertical Diet adherents — could potentially make it harder to get in the amount of food you require to keep performing at your best. For most people, the Vertical Diet may be best viewed as a short-term solution for addressing digestive issues or identifying more serious ailments like irritable bowel syndrome. Either way, it’s always best to consult with your healthcare provider or dietitian before beginning a new diet program. On the vertical diet, expect to eat a lot of white rice and red meat. Why these two staples? White rice is a clean carb that can easily be digested and is very low in fiber, fat, and antinutrients. Efferding prefers red meat as a source of protein because it is loaded with heme iron, B-vitamins, zinc, magnesium, creatine, and healthy fats. You’ll also be able to consume fruit, potatoes, sweet potatoes, spinach, red peppers, carrots, juice, and some animal products, like butter, broth, and fatty fish. The vertical diet was designed to help bodybuilders bulk up with minimal digestive issues. So while you could lose weight while following the Vertical Diet (by remaining in a calorie deficit), that’s not its intended purpose. Our expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois also reminds us, “Sustainable weight loss often requires a change in our relationship with food, and a registered dietitian can help you navigate those changes safely.” The Vertical Diet was designed for bodybuilders interested in how to build muscle while avoiding digestive problems. Reducing or eliminating high-FODMAP foods may be beneficial for those with digestive issues, but may be best as a short-term solution.

    "text": "We’re told to hydrate while we exercise for good reason: As you sweat, your body becomes dehydrated and you lose water and electrolytes, the minerals that help your muscles work properly and regulate blood pressure. ( 1 ) During a particularly hot and sweaty training session, drinking an electrolyte powder, which always includes sodium and potassium, and sometimes calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and chloride, can help keep your body performing at its best. But similar to the best BCAA supplements , there’s a pretty large list of electrolyte brands and products on the market. Different products are better suited for different athletes, training protocols, environmental conditions, and fitness goals. So, our team of experts, including personal trainers, athletes, and nutrition coaches, tested more than 20 products to find the best electrolyte supplements. Medical disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. When starting a new training regimen and/or diet, it is always a good idea to consult with a trusted medical professional or registered dietitian. We are not a medical resource. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems or injuries. They are not substitutes for consulting a qualified medical professional. Join Jake Herod, NASM-CNC , and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, as they discuss some of the best electrolyte supplements on the market in 2025, with a focus on products from brands like BUBS, XWERKS, and Liquid I.V. These convenient single-serve packs of electrolytes are great for on the go and come in a research-backed ratio to help keep you hydrated. They have high-quality, all-natural ingredients and are certified by NSF. Bubs Naturals Hydrate or Die is our top pick for the best electrolyte powder overall, due large in part to its formula that is free from artificial ingredients, includes all the main electrolytes your body needs, and comes in convenient on-the-go packets. Bubs Naturals hydration powder serves up 670 milligrams of sodium (29% daily value), 5 milligrams of calcium (0% daily value), 243 milligrams of potassium (6% daily value), 62 milligrams of magnesium (15% daily value), and 1,030 milligrams of chloride (45% daily value). Our testers also really liked the addition of two milligrams of iron (10% daily value), which isn’t common in many electrolyte supplements. Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois says, “With 2,000 total milligrams of electrolytes and 10g of carbs per serving, you get maximum hydration without the sugar crash. BUBS is packed with hydration-supporting goodness, making it a powerful tool for hard-hitting endurance athletes.” Bourgeois also loves that BUBS creates yummy flavors without any added sugar or artificial sweeteners, and it’s vegan-friendly and available in convenient, portable sizes. Plus, she points out, BUBS is 100% NSF for Sport Certified for safety and effectiveness. One thing to note is the high sodium content: 670 milligrams is a large chunk of the daily recommended intake, so this supplement should be saved for intense exercise, hot days, or those who are naturally heavy sweaters with a high sweat sodium concentration. Bourgeois gives the formula a score of 4 out of 5 points, saying, “It scores high marks for its electrolyte to carbohydrate ratio, but the deductions stem from the high sodium content, as it may not be appropriate for all athletes.” “I tested a packet of the orange flavor and it’s pretty salty,” according to Kate Meier, BarBend editorial staff member and competitive weightlifter, giving the flavor an overall score of 4 out of 5. “It also had a bit of a chalky after-taste. But other testers really enjoyed the saltiness, so it’s a personal preference!” Our testers sampled this electrolyte supplement in a shaker cup and gave it 5 out of 5 points for solubility. It dissolved perfectly fine and there were no floaties or gritty texture. We also liked the convenient single-serving packets, which are easy to keep in your gym bag or car. One 18-serving package costs $34, which comes out to about $1.88 per serving. This is definitely on the pricier side, considering most other electrolyte supplements cost $1.50 or less, so we had to give Bubs Naturals a 3.5-out-of-5 score for price per serving. Transparent Labs Hydrate contains 500mg of a coconut water powder complex that can potentially help promote satiation — thanks to the fiber content. Plus, it's combined with a dose of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and taurine for a complete electrolyte supplement. If you follow a fasting protocol but want to stay hydrated, you want to find a hydration electrolyte supplement that won’t break your fast. This zero-calorie option from Transparent Labs is great for mineral replenishment while you’re fasting without adding any macros and calories to your day. Transparent Labs Hydrate has a pretty solid formula, including calcium, magnesium, sodium, and potassium, some of which come from the inclusion of coconut water powder. While that gives it a tropical taste, it’s not suitable for individuals who have allergies to coconut. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, points out that Transparent Labs produces and offers clinically-dosed, science-backed formulas and their Hydrate rapid electrolyte replenisher is no different. This supplement sources electrolytes from bioavailable minerals, giving you an affordable and effective boost of hydration, she says, adding that she likes ”that Transparent Labs has harnessed the power of coconut water. As more research emerges, we’re finding coconut water offers comparable benefits to your typical sports drinks (like Gatorade), just from a more natural source,” Bourgeois says. Transparent Labs Hydrate also stands out due to its 1,000-milligram dose of taurine per serving. ( 10 ) “While the primary purpose behind Hydrate is improved hydration, you also get the benefits of taurine: less fatigue and muscle damage,” Bourgeois explains. “And if you have any concerns about safety and efficacy, you can find peace of mind in the product’s third-party testing.” Bourgeois also points out that this product contains proprietary blends, “which aren’t inherently bad, they just give a bit of mystery to a product.” Ultimately, she awarded the formula a score of 4.25 out of 5 points,  with deductions stemming from the included tree nuts and proprietary blend. The flavor was a little stronger than our tester, a certified personal trainer, expected, which some athletes may not like. “The company recommends mixing one serving with eight to 12 ounces of water, but I still thought the Tropical Punch flavor was too strong,” he says, giving the taste 4 out of 5 points. “It didn’t taste bad but I had to dilute this flavor a lot.” TL’s electrolyte formula did get a 5-out-of-5 score for solubility. Our tester had no issues mixing it with water and it dissolved without leaving any gritty floating substances. We even mixed it with cluster dextrin and all the ingredients dissolved perfectly fine. Our team also gave the price per serving 5 out of 5 points, considering this is one of the cheapest supplements on this list. One 40-serving container only costs $28.99, making it $0.72 per serving. Read our full Transparent Labs Hydrate Review . Xwerks contains three grams of BCAAs in a 2:1:1 ratio. Plus, there’s an added dose of calcium, magnesium, and sodium for hydration to make sure you’re hitting all your marks during and after your workout. When you’re doing a long-distance run or a sprint interval session, you’re probably going to sweat quite a bit. Keeping your body hydrated and fueled is crucial for performance, and XWERKS Motion is a good electrolyte supplement for runners of all levels. Unlike other similar supplements, XWERKS Motion contains 25 grams of carbohydrates, which can offer some additional fuel during your training session. You also get sodium, calcium, and magnesium to replenish your electrolyte levels, plus some BCAAs to help reduce fatigue and support muscle strength. ( 13 ) For runners specifically, this formula ticks a lot of boxes. Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois had this to say about the formula: “This is a multi-purpose formula that’s backed by science. It contains BCAAs and a serving of cluster dextrin, which has been shown to increase time to exhaustion and decrease stress hormone response. The cluster dextrin supports your workout in the moment, and the BCAAs support your recovery after you leave the gym.” Bourgeois adds that she loves that its ingredients are backed by clinical trials, and the 2:1:1 ratio of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. “My main hangup with it is the proprietary blend of BCAAs,” she says. “We know that it’s a 2:1:1 ratio, but how much of each BCAA are we getting per scoop? And while it doesn’t contain sugar, it does contain artificial sweeteners. I’m not an anti-artificial sweetener RD, but they can cause GI distress and the taste can be a tough one to get past for some.” ( 11 ) All those factors considered, Bourgeois gave Motion a score of 3.75 out of 5 points for formula, noting deductions for the proprietary blend. XWERKS Motion only comes in Raspberry Lemonade flavor, which our tester, a certified personal trainer, gave a 4 out of 5. “The raspberry flavor is much stronger than the lemonade,” he said. “It’s refreshing but it does have a powdery taste, so I had to mix it with more than the recommended amount of water.” We did give this supplement a score of 5 out of 5 for solubility, though. “It was easy to mix and dissolved completely,” our tester said. “I didn’t even need to use a blender ball in my cup.” This is great considering most runners don’t take a shaker cup on their runs — it will dissolve just fine in a running water bottle or hydration vest. Considering you get an extra dose of carbs and BCAAs in this supplement, our tester enjoyed using it right before a workout. “If I train early in the morning and don’t want to have a full meal, I have a serving of these electrolytes,” he said. “I definitely noticed a difference in my energy while working out. But I also use it as a recovery drink, too.” While this supplement is pretty versatile, we did have to give it a paltry 2 out of 5 for price per serving. At nearly $2 per serving, this is one of the most expensive electrolyte drink mixes on this list. Granted, the added BCAAs does mean you can save on a separate BCAA supplement. But if you’re a runner who doesn’t take BCAAs anyway, this cost may be tough to justify. [RELATED: The 11 Best Supplements for Runners ] Gainful hydration is available in three tasty flavors and multiple customer reviews back their popularity. You can also customize your formulation with added doses of caffeine for energy, or extra electrolytes for supporting your sweat-riddled workouts. Gainful Hydration is a customizable electrolyte blend that buyers can personalize based on their sweat rates and desire, or lack thereof, for caffeine. There are four possible combinations: A Little Sweaty, caffeinated; A Little Sweaty, not caffeinated; Super Sweaty, caffeinated; Super Sweaty, not caffeinated. This is a unique offering and not something I’ve seen with other electrolyte powders. I love that athletes can somewhat customize their formula based on their needs. You could even buy two different options to use in different scenarios. The formulas each contain four key electrolytes, but in different amounts to accommodate different sweat rates and sweat sodium concentrations: So, the Super Sweaty blend bumps up the sodium and magnesium content by 100 milligrams and 50 milligrams, respectively, while the potassium and calcium content remain the same. Frankly, both 300 and 400 milligrams of sodium are moderate amounts for a hydration powder, and could work well for most people exercising at moderate temperatures in moderate weather. Hot weather and high-intensity exercise—and high-sodium, heavy sweaters—may need more. The ingredients list is minimal; the formula is sweetened with both cane sugar and stevia, and includes natural flavor and color agents. I appreciate the fact that there are no proprietary blends in this formula, and I think it earns a solid score of 4 out of 5 points for its electrolyte balance. Our testers tried the Tropical Mango flavor and really enjoyed it, rating it with 4 out of 5 points. “ I really enjoyed the Tropical Mango flavor to the point where I would drink this just as a drink,” one tester said. “Several people on our team tried this, and some found it too sweet, but I didn’t.” This powder scored highly for solubility, too, earning 5 out of 5 possible points. “ Several of us mixed this with the recommended 12 ounces of water in a shaker cup, and even just stirred it with a spoon, and it dissolves really well,” our tester said. The Sports Research Hydrate formula is sugar-free and offers 400 milligrams of Sodium, along with 200 milligrams of Potassium. In each serving, you'll also find over 65 trace minerals, seven essential vitamins, and Coconut Fruit Water Powder. There are four flavors available — Cherry Pomegranate, Lemon Lime, Passion Fruit, Raspberry Lemonade. The importance of staying adequately hydrated as you age doesn’t change. Yet, older adults are much more susceptible to electrolyte imbalance and dehydration than younger people, according to some research. ( 2 ) Hyponatremia (low sodium) and hypernatremia (high sodium) are two of the most common hydration-related conditions in older people. ( 3 ) It’s super important to stay hydrated for overall health and wellness, and while it’s always best to consult your healthcare provider about supplements before using them, our team of fitness and nutrition professionals really likes Sports Research Hydrate as an electrolyte supplement. When Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD took a look at the label, two important factors helped the formula earn a 4 out of 5. “Each serving of Sports Research Hydrate provides 400 milligrams of sodium,” she says. “Plus, it’s sugar-free, making it an ideal hydration choice for those trying to limit their sugar intake or control their blood sugar levels.” [Related : Best Electrolyte Drinks ] But this blend isn’t limited to older individuals. Research suggests that ingesting sodium before working out can positively affect hydration and physical performance ( 4 ), and competitive athletes will also appreciate that Hydrate’s formula has been tested for any banned substances. “I also like that this product is Informed-Sport certified, providing peace of mind when incorporating it into your hydration routine,” Bourgeois adds. Sports Research Hydrate offers four flavors, and BarBend editorial member Matt Cummings had the chance to mix up a packet of the Passion Fruit variety himself. He rated its solubility with 5 out of 5 points and added, “After about ten seconds of shaking, I could barely tell it was ever a powder.” He also said it wasn’t quite like a fresh tropical fruit cocktail, but it was pretty close. There was one aspect that cost its overall taste rating a point, though. “It did taste rather salty, so I scratched a point there.” Hydrate is sugar-free, but as Bourgeois points out, its sweetener could be an issue for anyone with gastrointestinal problems. ( 8 ) “ Hydrate is sweetened with steviol glycosides, which may cause GI issues in some people,” she says. “Be mindful when taking supplements with artificial sweeteners if you have a history of GI distress.” Liquid I.V.'s hydration multiplier is ideal for athletes who like to take their workouts on-the-go, thanks to the convenient single-serving packets. These also contain additional vitamins and nutrients. When you’re constantly on-the-go, catching flights or hitting the road, staying hydrated can become an afterthought. We like Liquid I.V.’s easy single-serving packets for frequent travelers. Just toss a few packets in your suitcase or travel bag and stay hydrated during your whole trip. With 3 times more electrolytes than the average sports drink, registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois says it can help sweaty athletes replenish lost electrolytes much faster than just water alone. “Liquid I.V. is an appropriate option for endurance athletes who lose a lot of sweat, especially those spending a lot of time outside in the hot weather,” she says. “Plus, each serving of Liquid I.V. provides hefty doses of B vitamins, including B3, B5, B6, B12, and vitamin C, helping you reach your daily recommendations for each in a convenient portable package.” Though Liquid I.V. Hydration Multiplier heavily relies on the science of oral rehydration solutions, there is no mention of third-party testing, which Bourgeois points out as a con. “Furthermore, each serving provides more than 500 milligrams of sodium and 10 grams of added sugar, meaning it’s not an appropriate hydration solution for everyone.” Those that don’t sweat excessively during their workout may not need that much sodium, she says, and those monitoring their blood sugar levels may prefer to avoid added sugars. Liquid I.V. gets a 4 out of 5 for its formulation, according to Bourgeois. Our tester gave the flavor 4.5 out of 5 points after trying the Lemon Lime and Acai Berry. “The taste is very yummy,” says our tester, who’s also a certified personal trainer. “It’s not too sweet and only a little bit salty.” However, another tester rated the flavor with 2 out of 5 points. “After trying the Lemon Lime myself, I thought it was way too sweet for my liking,” they said. “It’s not as sweet as a pre-workout supplement, for instance, but I prefer my electrolytes to taste like lightly flavor-infused water. While I don’t love the flavor personally, I do still keep a few packets in my travel bag and car.” For solubility, we gave this product a 3 out of 5. Our testers didn’t think it was too grainy but definitely noticed some particles floating in my water bottle. “I’m sure they would have dissolved with a shaker bottle, but I love to sip a hydration drink on a long bike ride and shakers don’t fit in my bike’s bottle cages,” they said. We did really like the price per serving, though. One 16-serving box costs $24.99, which is only about $1.56 per serving. We gave this cost a 3.75 out of 5, as it’s cheaper than some pricier formulas but you still can find less expensive options. Read our full Liquid I.V. Review LMNT Recharge electrolytes come in a variety of flavors, from chocolate and caramel varieties to fruity and citrus tastes. You can even opt for a variety pack for more flavor options. LMNT Recharge electrolytes come in nine different flavors, including some unique options, like Mango Chili, Chocolate Caramel, and Grapefruit Salt. After trying the Mango Chili, our testers were pretty satisfied, giving it 5 out of 5 points in the taste category. “The Mango Chili flavor isn’t overly sweet. Actually, it’s almost savory instead. When you first sip it, you taste sweetness from the mango but then you get some spiciness from the chili,” our tester said. “It didn’t taste artificial at all and I’d definitely buy this flavor again.” This formula includes sodium and potassium in the amounts of 1,000 milligrams and 100 milligrams, respectively. It also contains 60 milligrams of magnesium. While this formula may be a winner for athletes with high sweat rates and/or high sweat sodium concentrations, and those exercising in very hot climates, the sodium content is likely too high for most people. This led me to score the formula with 3 out of 5 points: It’s an excellent option for hot, high-intensity, and/or long-duration workouts, but most people don’t need to get 43% of the daily value of sodium from a single beverage. Our testers didn’t notice any negative side effects after trying this supplement for several workouts. “This one is actually pretty light on my stomach,” our tester said, giving this category a 5 out of 5. “I think the lack of sugar in the formula helped me stay alert and energized.” LMNT also earned 5 out of 5 points for solubility. After mixing it in a water bottle, we didn’t notice any graininess or clumping. It dissolved pretty quickly and smoothly, which is what you want for an intra-workout supplement. Who wants to spend 10 minutes between sets shaking up a supplement, right?  These small packets of 450 mg of amino acids, 55 mg of sodium, and 20 mg of caffeine are super easy to use on the go. Just tear the top off and squeeze — even if you are running, you won’t have to stop to consume them. Electrolyte gels are ideal for anyone who loves long-distance physical activity. Whether you’re taking them in your pocket on a long run or just throwing them in your gym bag, this pick is one of the easiest electrolyte supplements to transport. Our tester, a former collegiate runner, road racer, and triathlete, is no stranger to GU energy gels and has tried practically every flavor. “For endurance training, I’d give the formula a 4 out of 5. You get a few of the major electrolytes, including sodium, calcium, and potassium,” they said. “Plus, there are about 23 grams of carbs per serving with zero fiber, which means your body can digest these quickly, using them for energy while you train.” According to registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, GU Energy Gel Shots tackle hydration and then some. “Packed with electrolytes, slow and fast-acting carbs, and BCAAs, this gel can help you maximize performance and recovery,” she says. ( 13 ) “I love that you get 450 milligrams of amino acids with every serving of GU, and it’s all vegan-friendly and tested for banned substances.” GU Energy Gel Shots contain various nutrients, all necessary for a solid workout, Bourgeois says, but notes that the portions of each nutrient are geared towards the here and now versus long term—that is, they’re great for intra-workout support, but not rehydration after a workout or all-day hydration. Also worth noting: there are only 5 flavors available without caffeine. If you’re looking for a stimulant-free hydration option, you are limited on taste. Considering all the ingredients and purported benefits, Bourgeois rates this formulation with 4.25 out of 5 points. These convenient packets scored highly for taste. “ GU has a pretty wide range of flavor options and I’d say the taste is an overall 4 out of 5,” our tester said. “I personally enjoy the Salted Caramel and Chocolate Outrage flavors. I’m a huge sweet tooth and in the middle of a 60-mile bike ride, they taste like a treat. I have cycling friends who absolutely hate the dessert-style flavors and prefer the fruity varieties. So, it’s definitely a personal choice.” The price per serving isn’t as cheap as some other electrolyte supplements. One packet costs about $1.60 or $12.80 for a box of eight. However, our tester really likes the convenience of the packets. They fit great in just about any pocket or running belt. GU energy gels aren’t for everyone, but if you’re a long-distance endurance athlete, they’re worth a try, in our opinion. Sipping electrolytes in your water is an excellent way to stay hydrated but if you’re running or biking for many miles, having a form of solid electrolytes with some calories can help keep your energy levels high. Available on Amazon and in just about any store, Propel Electrolytes are a quick, easy, and delicious way to get essential electrolytes. Propel is a staple in hydration powders. You can find them at virtually any grocery store or convenience store, as well as almost everywhere online. Propel electrolyte powder was one of the highest-rated supplements we tested in terms of taste. It earned 5 out of 5 points in this category. “ I absolutely love these packets,” said our tester, BarBend editorial team member and personal trainer Kate Meier. “My favorite is Raspberry Lemonade, which I could drink all day. The other tastes are fantastic. I think the grape tastes like a purple Kool-Aid, the Strawberry Kiwi has a strong strawberry taste.” “The flavors are strong, but not so strong that it’s hard to get down,” she continued. “And I love that it’s not overly sweet or artificial-tasting like some sports drinks are .” Propel also received high remarks for solubility. Kate awarded it 5 out of 5 points, saying, “ This dissolves so easily and without much work: just a few shakes of a blender cup with ice and you’re good to go .” While we love the taste and texture of Propel, its formula didn’t earn a score quite as high. With just 210 milligrams of sodium and 70 milligrams of potassium, this blend is best suited to those with low sweat rates and/or low sweat sodium concentrations, doing low-to-moderate-intensity exercise, or exercising in cooler climates. Between the lower electrolyte concentration and the use of artificial ingredients, I gave this formula a score of 3 out of 5 points. On the upside, Propel is relatively affordable, coming in at about $15 for 10 travel packets, or $1.50 per serving. It’s not the cheapest nor the priciest, and travelers—or those who go straight from work or school to training—will appreciate the convenience of the travel packs. Nuun Sport tablets easily dissolve into liquid and provide substantial electrolytes to replenish you. There are 10 delicious flavors to choose from, each of which our testers love. I’m a big fan of Nuun Sport hydration tablets. These little alka-seltzer-like tablets dissolve into water with zero effort—just pop it in and wait—and leave you with a refreshing, tasty, fizzy drink. I’ve tried almost all flavors of Nuun Sport and I haven’t yet met one I didn’t like. They’re a go-to for post-workout hydration, especially after runs in the sun, because the fizziness is just so refreshing. A word of caution: Don’t dissolve one of these tablets into a closed bottle and transport it. It might explode due to the carbonation, and that wouldn’t be a good time for anyone. I’m speaking from personal experience here… These tablets contain moderate amounts of electrolytes, including 300 milligrams of sodium and 150 milligrams of potassium, making them a suitable choice for most activities in a lot of different climates. You may need more electrolytes if you’re a heavy sweater, working out in a very hot climate, or doing a particularly intense or long session. Overall, I think the formula deserves 4 out of 5 points, with a nod of approval to the inclusion of caffeine in some flavors. I’m not the only one who likes Nuun Sport on the BarBend team. It earned a score of 5 out of 5 points from our testers. One tester said, “ Our team tried several versions of this, including one with caffeine. The Wild Berry flavor is fantastic. It’s not overly sweet or tangy, just the right amount of flavor.” Our testers also appreciated the solubility. They awarded it 4 out of 5 points, docking the one point because, in their experience, “ The tablet doesn’t fully dissolve on its own, you might have to shake your cup a little to get it to mix all the way. We still saw some sediment at the bottom of our glass, but it wasn’t a dealbreaker for us.” As you may see with protein powders or pre-workout supplements, there are seemingly endless electrolyte brands and options on the market. So, in order to really gather all the best, our team of expert product testers, including certified personal trainers and athletes, tried about 24 different electrolyte supplements to narrow down the best of the best. This is how we put our top picks to the test using our supplement testing methodology : Though drinking 64 ounces (or more) of water a day is always the best way to stay hydrated, electrolyte supplementation doesn’t hurt and can be ideal in situations where your electrolytes have been especially depleted. These instances include periods of illness, morning hangovers, after long or intense workouts, or perspiring in extreme heat. A few of the main minerals found in electrolyte supplements are sodium, chloride, calcium, potassium, and magnesium. These minerals can potentially help with nervous impulses, contracting muscles, keeping you hydrated, and regulating your body’s pH levels, all of which should keep your body functioning properly.  ( 1 ) The primary benefits of electrolyte powders include maintenance and support of ( 1 ): Electrolytes are most necessary in cases where the body’s water supply has been especially depleted, which can be in extreme heat, after a night of heavy drinking, when you’re sick, or even after long, intense workouts. The fluid in your body contains electrolytes like sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These minerals dissolve in water and produce ions that send electrical signals throughout the body to help it function properly. ( 5 ) When water is depleted, the mineral balance is also thrown off — that’s why it’s particularly important to take in high doses of electrolytes when you’ve lost water. If you’re feeling lightheaded, having muscle cramps, or fighting with a headache after exercise or intense heat, you’ve likely already lost a good bit of electrolytes. So before going for an extended run or subjecting yourself to an activity or environment where you’ll be sweating intensely, it’s worth taking a precautionary dose of electrolytes to stave off cramps and dizziness (which can be caused by a lack of electrolytes). When purchasing an electrolyte supplement, you can expect to pay somewhere between $12 and $60 per container. Check out the chart below to compare prices, but keep in mind that bulk powders can be less than $1.00 per serving while ready-to-consume electrolyte products generally run between $1.50 and $3.00 per serving. Staying adequately hydrated is important for maintaining your health, especially during very intense, long workouts, endurance running, swimming or biking, or extended exposure to an excessively hot environment. Here are a few things to consider about electrolyte supplements before you decide which one is best for you. The primary mineral of concern in sodium. This electrolyte is lost in the greatest quantities through sweat, and it’s critical to replace it. ( 12 ) You’ll also want to look for a small amount of potassium (50 to 200 milligrams, depending on your needs), an important electrolyte for maintaining both fluid balance and muscle contractions. Magnesium, chloride, and other minerals are needed in smaller amounts. ( 6 ) Though not everyone will want to consume added sugars through an electrolyte supplement, I’d be remiss not to mention that glucose is an extremely important factor in rehydration. Glucose molecules assist in the uptake and absorption of electrolytes, so a supplement with sugar may help you rehydrate faster than one without. ( 6 ) However, not all workouts are intense enough to need glucose replacement, and consuming excess glucose can counteract the benefits of exercise. Consider your specific activity level, health goals, and individual factors to decide if glucose is necessary in your mix. Dietary and hydration needs are incredibly individual. It’s always best to work with a qualified registered dietitian to help you understand what your body needs, especially if you’re an athlete or regular exerciser. Not every electrolyte supplement will work for every person, even if everyone did the same activity at the same intensity in the same climate for the same amount of time! Consider investing in a sweat test to measure your sweat rate (liters per hour) and sweat sodium concentration (milligrams of sodium lost per liter of sweat). This is the only true way to know which electrolyte powder is best for you. And don’t forget: Your needs will change based on exercise intensity, duration, and climate. For those with medical conditions, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes, checking the sodium content and sugar content of an electrolyte powder is critical. ( 14 ) Always talk to your doctor before starting a new supplement, especially if you have existing medical conditions. While electrolytes are a generally convenient supplement to take, there are some forms that are more convenient than others. If you’re a long distance runner or need something you can take with you on long hikes, a gel packet is going to be the easiest to bring with you. If you’re looking for something pre-portioned that you can just grab and go, a bottle of liquid electrolytes won’t slow you down. But if you have the time and the patience to mix your powder in some water, you can buy these powders in bulk, and one purchase will last you much longer than individual packets of gel or bottled liquid electrolytes. Make sure you’re considering what will best suit your lifestyle and workout before you decide which form of electrolytes you want to buy. As far as supplements go, most forms of electrolytes are fairly inexpensive. However, the individual packets and pre-portioned options are going to be more expensive than the powder that you can buy in a bulk tub. Anything portioned out will be more convenient to take, but you’ll definitely pay for that convenience. Whereas the powder takes a little more time to mix with water, so since it requires a little more work, you will be able to find it at a cheaper price. Before you buy your supplement, decide on your budget and find a product that aligns. It depends on your lifestyle. If you are someone who works out hard and often, replenishing your fluid supply with electrolytes isn’t a bad idea. However, if you’re drinking at least 64 ounces of water a day and aren’t doing anything to drastically deplete your body’s water supply, you don’t necessarily need to take electrolytes. The most common side effects will be dizziness, headaches, and muscle cramps. Some more serious symptoms may be irregular heartbeat and mental confusion. However, so long as you are healthy and drinking the proper amount of water, you’re unlikely to feel serious symptoms of electrolyte depletion. It depends on your own personal preference — there is no right answer. If you want something already mixed and portioned, you should snag a gel or a bottle of liquid electrolytes. If you’re looking for something you can buy in bulk, a tub of powder will be a better option for you. Right now, we’re big fans of BUBS Naturals Hydrate or Die because it comes in convenient individual serving packets.This product also offers a solid dose of electrolytes in a clinical ratio, and is third-party certified to only contain what it says on the label.

    "text": "Supplement stacks are common among athletes and fitness enthusiasts who want to maximize the benefits of their nutritional supplements to meet specific exercise goals. What’s a supplement stack ? It’s a combination of different supplements that are taken together that have complementary properties or purposes that enhance physical performance. For example, a basic stack may include some of the best supplements for muscle growth , a pre-workout, and a post-workout, while a more comprehensive stack may throw fish oil, multivitamins, and probiotics into the mix. Our team of certified personal trainers and nutrition experts at BarBend has curated a list of our top pre-assembled supplement stacks. We’ve included a range of options, from stacks for bodybuilders to those for beginners — here are our picks for the best supplement stacks for athletes on the market today. Medical disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice.

They are not substitutes for consulting a qualified medical professional. Join BarBend expert tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC , and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD , as they break down what’s included in our picks for the best supplement stacks for athletes, bodybuilders, and those in a cut. The Momentous Athletic Resilience Stack uses natural ingredients that are clinically dosed to aid in recovery, muscle growth, and repair. The Momentous Athletic Resilience Stack is specifically designed to enhance athletic recovery and cognitive function. The stack features five unique products: Grass-Fed Whey Protein, Recovery, Collagen Peptides, Magnesium Threonate, and Zinc Picolinate. All products are made with natural ingredients, meaning they don’t contain artificial sweeteners, flavors, or colors. The Grass-Fed Whey Protein provides 20 grams of whey isolate per scoop, enough to stimulate muscle protein synthesis for growth and repair. Whey protein is a key product in all of the best muscle-building supplement stacks. It is rich in branched-chain amino acids, particularly leucine, which activates the muscle-building process. (If whey protein upsets your stomach, consider a vegan supplement stack or choose one of the best vegan protein powders .) “Momentous Whey Protein Isolate powder is backed by science and formulated with the help of registered dietitians,” states Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer, who rated the formulation at 4.25 out of 5. We’re big fans of this protein supp, scoring its taste a 4 out of 5. “It was enjoyable in any liquid, but I really felt the taste come to life when mixing this powder with my milk of choice. I think the Vanilla and Chocolate varieties pair best with this creamier liquid base.” Solubility, meanwhile, gets a 5 out of 5. “I thought it mixed easily enough for a quick shake,” says our tester. Momentous Recovery, meanwhile, is intended to help heal muscles and restore glycogen stores after an intense training session. It contains a 2:1 ratio of protein (20 grams) and carbs (10 grams) designed to fuel rapid recovery. Furthermore, Recovery includes glutamine and l-carnitine, amino acids known to reduce muscle soreness and promote rebuilding making this one of the best post workout supplements . Collagen peptides is another important supplement in the Momentous Athletic Resilience Stack. Each serving provides 10 grams of bovine collagen, a type of protein that works to strengthen bones, tendons, ligaments, and joints and may enhance muscle recovery. Studies suggest that a bovine collagen supplement can help reduce the wear and tear on joints and ligaments to support optimal physical performance. ( 1 ) Magnesium threonate can help support sleep, which is crucial for muscle recovery and cognitive function, including memory and mood. Additionally, zinc picolinate is included to potentially boost immune function. Zinc has also been shown to have antioxidant properties, helping to reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage caused by free radicals. Ultimately, we rate the formulation of this stack a 5 out of 5. Each product contains clean, effective ingredients that are backed by science. Another bonus is that Momentous claims that their ingredients are ethically and sustainably sourced. Furthermore, all Momentous products are NSF-certified for quality and safety, earning this category a 5 out of 5. This third-party testing gives customers peace of mind knowing that what’s on the label is what’s actually in the products. Since this stack is designed for athletic resilience, it doesn’t include a pre-workout or creatine supp, which may disappoint some athletes. If muscle-building is your goal, you’ll want to check out Legion’s Muscle Growth Stack or JYM’s Muscle-Building Stack. This stack with Legion brings together the Pulse Pre-Workout to get you ready, protein powder to build muscle, and Recharge Post-Workout to help you recover Legion Muscle Growth Stack may support all your wildest bodybuilding aspirations with Pulse Pre-Workout, Whey+ Protein Powder, and Recharge Post-Workout. Together, these products can help you work out harder and recover faster for big results. Legion’s supplements are tested by Labdoor for potency and purity, resulting in a 5 out of 5 score across the board for third-party testing. Legion also highlights 83 peer-reviewed studies that support their ingredients and doses, so that you can take some of the best supplements for bodybuilding without any unnecessary additives or fillers. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian, was impressed when assessing the product for BarBend . “ It’s rare to come across all-natural ingredients backed by stacks of clinical research. What’s advertised is what you get… There’s total transparency in the formulas.” We love the customization options customers have when ordering this stack. You can choose between whey, casein, and plant-based protein powders, and either a caffeinated pre-workout or a stim-free option. It truly feels like you’re just ordering your favorite supplements, not some pre-selected stack that lacks personalization. With each choice, customers can choose from a variety of flavors for both the protein and pre-workout. “ I thought the Blue Raspberry Pre-Workout had a weird aftertaste, ” our tester, a certified nutrition coach and personal trainer, notes. “ But at least it mixed well. ” For solubility, they gave a 5 out of 5. We’re big fans of Legion’s Whey+ Protein Powder, which pairs 5.6 grams of BCAAs with 22 to 25 grams of protein, depending on the type and flavor of protein you choose. We rated its overall formulation a 5 out of 5. We do, however, wish it had a stronger taste. “ I had the Cinnamon Cereal and there was only a hint of flavor, ” says our tester, a certified nutrition coach and personal trainer. Perfect for strenuous days in the gym, the 3.6 grams of beta-alanine and 2.5 grams of betaine in Pulse Pre-Workout may help boost power, strength, and muscle endurance . ( 18 )( 22 ) It’s also packed with 8 grams of citrulline malate, a nitric oxide booster that supports blood flow for improved physical performance. With competition dates looming, preparation is key. Recharge Post-Workout packs a healthy dose of l-carnitine that works to provide fast muscle recovery and reduce soreness. ( 19 ) Recharge also comes with 10.5 milligrams of corosolic acid, which may help decrease blood sugar levels and improve glucose metabolism. ( 20 )( 21 ) It also packs 5 grams of micronized creatine to boost lean muscle gains while reducing soreness. ( 10 ) This is a pretty comprehensive strength-building stack, but it may lack the kinds of heavy-duty formulations sought out by bodybuilders. If that’s what you’re after, check out Muscle Tech’s OG Bundle or Optimum Nutrition’s Mass Stack. The OG Bundle is a classic combination of whey protein and creatine, two of the most studied supplements available for athletes. Each product comes in a variety of flavors. Muscle Tech’s OG Bundle is a no-nonsense stack for serious weight lifters looking to unleash their fullest muscle growth potential. This stack contains only two products — Nitro-Tech Whey Protein and Cell-Tech Creatine — both crammed with key ingredients to activate and support hypertrophy . ( 10 ) Nitro-Tech Whey Protein delivers an impressive 30 grams of whey protein concentrate, isolate, and peptides — more than most protein powders on the market today. It also includes 3 grams of creatine to boost strength and power, along with 6.6 grams of branched-chain amino acids to stimulate muscle building and support muscle repair after intense training sessions. ( 3 )( 10 ) It does, however, leave something lacking in terms of taste. Our tester, a certified personal trainer, tried the Milk Chocolate flavor and scores it a 3 out of 5. “My first sips were really terrible, but I settled into it after a while. You can taste the chocolate, but it’s heavy on the sugar,” they say. Solubility was no issue — a 5 out of 5 — but they score the texture a 3 out of 5. “I only mixed it with water, so that may be part of it, but it wasn’t creamy at all. Very thin,” they say. While the added creatine is a nice bonus, it’s not necessary and could contribute to bloating and diarrhea, especially since you’re already getting creatine from the Cell-Tech Creatine product. ( 2 ) Cell-Tech Creatine is a recovery supplement that boasts 5 grams of creatine and 38 grams of carbohydrates per serving to restore glycogen and creatine stores. Research consistently demonstrates creatine’s ability to increase muscle mass and enhance exercise capacity, particularly when paired with short, high-intensity workouts ( 10 ). The product also contains 1 gram of taurine, which is believed to help reduce muscle soreness post-workout ( 23 ). While there’s a lot to love about these products, it’s also important to note that they include artificial flavors, colors, and sweeteners, which docked their formulation score to a 4 out of 5. They also lack third-party testing. They’re a little more costly, but if you want a stack with no artificial sweeteners and third-party certification, check out the Legion Muscle Growth Stack. [Related: How To Build Muscle ] Composed of Serious Mass mass gainer (a protein supplement ) and Micronized Creatine Capsules, this simple yet effective supplement stack can be perfect for athletes looking to bulk up through added muscle mass and weight gain. Additionally, the sub-$100 price tag can be great for keeping your budget aligned through multiple months of supplementation. Ordering a bundled supplement stack can be expensive, with many costing well over $100. However, the Optimum Nutrition Mass Stack is a more affordable option for those on a budget, costing only $72.99. The stack is great for bulking and is specifically geared towards athletes wanting to gain weight and muscle. (If you’re more interested in lean muscle, some solid alternatives include Legion’s Muscle Growth Stack or JYM’s Muscle-Building Stack. For those transitioning from cutting to bulking , where more calories and protein are essential, Serious Mass makes it easier to meet those needs, especially for those with a high metabolism. Each serving delivers a whopping 1,250 calories, 50 grams of protein, and 250 to 253 grams of carbohydrates, depending on the flavor. Additionally, it provides 20 essential vitamins and minerals that support everything from immune health to energy metabolism. ( 5 )( 6 ) Optimum Nutrition also adds 5 grams of creatine monohydrate to this mass gainer, which can be beneficial when trying to strike a balance between gaining muscle, not just weight. ( 7 ) We rate Serious Mass at 4 out of 5 for its formulation, as we appreciate how well-rounded it is as a complete source of nutrition. However, it is made with a fair amount of maltodextrin and artificial sweeteners which kept it from receiving a perfect score. “For a supplement meant to support weight gain, including creatine helps put on muscle mass,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer. “I also like that they kept the formula pretty low in fat. Many mass gainer supplements include a significant amount of saturated fat to boost the calories, and that’s not the case here.” It is recommended that you use a countertop blender when mixing up the best mass gainers , and Serious Mass is no exception. “I do recommend pulsing this mixture a bit, though,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer, who scores solubility a 3 out of 5. “Just to ensure that every bit of powder is broken up and combined with the liquid.” As for taste, we score it a 3.5 out of 5. “I enjoyed this mixture and think it can be an appealing pick for athletes,” says our tester. “The Vanilla option I tried was a middle-of-the-road taste that’s good enough for daily consumption but nothing I’d personally write home about.” The Micronized Creatine Capsules have a super simple formulation, with creatine monohydrate being the only active ingredient. This simplicity makes it easy to keep your supplementation regimen transparent and track your dosages accurately, which is why we rated the formulation 4.5 out of 5. The creatine capsules are completely unflavored, so there aren’t any competing flavors between the pills and your beverage of choice. However, some may find that the pills are larger than desired, making getting them down a bit uncomfortable. Read our full Optimum Nutrition Creatine 2500 Caps Review . JYM brings together a High-Performance Pre-Workout, protein powder, BCAAs+ Recovery Matrix, and Fish Oil to round out this stack. With so many options available, you may be wondering what to consider when building a supplement stack . If you’re an athlete, having products that prepare your body for competition is key. The JYM Muscle Building Stack puts competitors center stage by bundling a pre-workout, omega-3s, protein powder, and recovery supplement. Taste, solubility, and profile all scored high for each product across this stack, with a score of 4.2 out of 5 for the entire bundle. “ I think these supplements are all really good quality ,” says our tester, a USA Weightlifting Level-1 coach. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian nutritionist and our expert reviewer, called out the “6 grams of BCAAs in the well-researched 2:1:1 ratio, and beet root extract, which has been linked to improved nitric oxide production.” ( 26 ) She scores the formulation a 4 out of 5, noting that while its doses of creatine, beta-alanine, and betaine are “on the low end of what science shows to be most effective in pre-workout formulas,” the addition of components like BioPerine “may help maximize the effects of the other ingredients.” Each serving also packs a whopping 300 milligrams of caffeine. The ingredients completely sold one of our testers. “ It kept me energized and the pump I felt really boosted my ego, ” they say. Overall, our testing team is crazy about this pre-workout. “ We’ve tried countless pre-workouts over the last decade, and this is the one everyone always goes back to, ” our tester says. We rated this pre-workout a 4.5 out of 5 for taste. Pro JYM Protein Powder delivers 24 grams of protein in the form of whey protein isolate, micellar casein, and milk protein isolate, which your body absorbs at varying speeds. Fast-digesting protein is ideal for athletes looking to build lean tissue immediately following a workout, and slow-digesting protein remains in your bloodstream longer, allowing you to continue rebuilding your muscles hours after you’ve downed your drink. ( 13 )( 14 ) “ It’s probably not the best tasting protein powder you’ll ever try, ” says our tester. “ But it wasn’t too bad. ” With the addition of JYM Omega Fish Oil and BCAAs + Recovery Matrix Post-Workout, you’re giving your muscles tools to recover and rebuild so you can return to training faster. Fish oil can help reduce inflammation, while the 6 grams of 2:1:1 BCAAs in the Recovery Matrix may activate muscle protein synthesis ( 8 )( 9 )( 15 ). What’s more, 3 grams of glutamine and 2 grams of creatine HCI could help reduce soreness. ( 11 )( 12 ) It’s worth noting that serving sizes aren’t uniform across the stack, so you may run out of one supplement before the others. Still, it’s hard to overlook the quality of the ingredients here. “ It’s a good combination of fish oil, creatine, beta-alanine, and glutamine. So if you’re an active person, these pre- and post-workout benefits might be what you want, ” our tester said. It’s worth noting, though, that this stack contains 300 milligrams of caffeine, which is 75% of the FDA’s daily recommendation. If you’re trying to cut back on your caffeine, you may want to Legion’s Muscle Growth Stack, which offers stim-free options. The Cellucor Thermogenic Bundle is ideal for those looking to boost energy and muscular endurance. The thermogenic blends may also aid in burning more calories. The Cellucor Thermogenic Bundle is made for individuals wanting to supercharge their workouts to burn more calories for a leaner physique. The bundle includes two products, C4 Ripped Pre-Workout and Super HD, a fat burner . They’re both formulated with ingredients intended to boost energy levels and fire up your metabolism. C4 Ripped Pre-Workout contains many standard pre-workout ingredients, with 1 gram of citrulline malate and 1.6 grams of beta-alanine, which Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer, notes are “less than what research says is ideal.” Still, she says C4 is “great for athletes with a low to moderate caffeine tolerance, as each scoop contains around 150 milligrams of caffeine.” She also likes that it’s sugar-free. Overall, Bourgeois scores the formulation a 3.75 out of 5. But what sets it Ripped apart is its inclusion of a thermogenic blend designed to boost metabolism and increase calorie burning. This blend features cayenne and green coffee seed extract, both known for their thermogenic properties. ( 16 ) Additionally, it contains L-carnitine, which research suggests can support fat metabolism. ( 17 ) As for Super HD, it includes a thermogenic blend with Yohimbe bark extract, dandelion root extract, and cayenne fruit extract, which may help enhance heat production and ergogenesis. ( 24 ) While these ingredients can potentially boost metabolism and support fat loss for athletes , their effectiveness is likely minimal without regular exercise and a balanced diet. For those uninterested in the thermogenic blend, we’d recommend the Legion Muscle Growth stack, which includes a more straightforward pre-workout. Caffeine and green tea extract are key ingredients in Super HD. The 160 milligrams of caffeine may enhance energy and mental focus, leading to more effective workouts and increased calorie burning during training sessions. Green tea extract improves fat oxidation, helping the body use fat as an energy source more efficiently. ( 25 ) We SCORE the Super HD formulation a 4 out of 5. While the thermogenic ingredients may be effective when combined with other healthy habits, the product contains proprietary blends so we aren’t sure exactly how much of each ingredient we are getting. Given that these products aren’t third-party tested, we rated this category a 1 out of 5. However, the cost is a major bonus at just $52.50. If you’re seeking the best supplement stack for cutting, consider adding a high-quality protein powder to this Cellucor Thermogenic Bundle for a budget-friendly way to maintain lean mass while shedding body fat. The BarBend team includes competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, nutrition coaches, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. We’ve thoroughly evaluated and tested over 400 individual products from leading brands. Using our multi-point supplement testing methodology , we rated each of these products on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) to determine the best supplement stacks on the market. Below, we highlight the key categories that influenced our rankings. A supplement stack is a convenient, cost-effective way to support your fitness and physique goals. Whether you’re looking to build size, save money, or are curious about how to lose fat and gain muscle , there’s a stack out there for you. Supplements cost a lot less when sold together in a stack than they would if you bought them as individual products. These stacks range in price from roughly $50 to $160 for a month’s supply. On average, you can expect to pay around $120 for a supplement stack, but these prices can vary depending on the number and type of supplements included. Supplement stacks are tailored to help you find all the right products for your fitness journey in one fell swoop. But before you commit to a stack, there are a few factors that deserve some consideration. Below are some examples of what to consider when building supplement stacks. When shopping for supplements of any kind, keep in mind that brands are making a targeted effort to pitch their products to you first and foremost. For consumers, this can mean having to sift through dubious claims about efficacy or ingredients. While the products on this list contain science-backed ingredients, make sure to do your own research and read the supplement label thoroughly before making a final decision or purchase. Keep in mind that not every claim a product makes is going to hold true for every individual, and results will vary. The best way to achieve fitness goals is through consistent exercise and healthy food habits, including plenty of high-protein foods . A supplement stack can help you fill gaps in your nutrition intake. Rather than buying all five or six of the products in a stack separately, you can snag them all at once. But if you don’t actually need all the products in the bundle, don’t get suckered into buying a whole stack when you will only end up using one or two. A supplement stack of four products isn’t necessarily four times more effective than a single item. If you’ve figured out how to count macros and are hitting your macros from whole food sources, recover well post-training, but wish you had more energy in the gym, you may just need a solid pre-workout rather than a whole new stack of products. Bottom line: Buy what you need. [Read More: The Best Greens Powders , Tested, Chosen, and Approved by a Dietitian] Not all supplements in a stack are created equal. Some stacks feature high-quality ingredients, research-backed dosages, and third-party testing, while others may include artificial fillers, low dosages, and lack transparency. “ Be sure to look at the ingredients and dosages of each supplement within the stack, not just one or two, and make sure you know what you are getting in each one ,” cautions Dr. Jennie Stanford, M.D., FAAFP, DipABOM. Look for products that include research-backed ingredients at clinically effective dosages. For example, whey protein, a fast-absorbing protein, is shown to activate muscle protein synthesis when taken in doses of 20 to 40 grams. So, if you’re shopping for a muscle-building supplement stack, consider one with a whey protein powder that provides at least 20 grams of protein per serving. Also, if you have any dietary preferences or needs it’s important to take them into consideration before purchasing a supplement stack. For instance, if you’re sensitive to caffeine, you may want to search for a supplement stack with one of the best non-stim pre-workouts . Likewise, if you prefer to avoid lactose, you’ll want to look for supplement stacks that offer plant-based or egg white protein powders. “ If you are sensitive to gluten, be sure to read labels carefully to ensure each product in the stack is free from gluten and the risk of cross-contamination ,” Dr. Stanford advises. “ Transparent labeling is key here, so that you know the ingredients within each supplement .” One of the best stacks we’ve found is the Legion Muscle Growth Stack. It includes a pre-workout, protein powder, and post-workout recovery supplement with creatine. We love that it’s customizable, with a variety of protein powder options, stim or non-stim pre-workout choices, and flavors to choose from. Not really. It can seem odd at a glance that a stack includes a high-calorie protein powder and a fat burner, but these products target different aspects of function and performance without interfering with one another. If your nutrition is on point to support your goals, then you don’t necessarily need to take multiple supplements at once. However, it can be difficult to get all the nutrients you need for muscle building from whole foods alone, so adding in supplements that boost energy, stimulate muscle growth , and support recovery may help you reach your goals faster. For most individuals, it can be safe to take supplements daily. It’s best to consult your doctor before starting a new supplement, especially if you’re taking prescription medication or have a diagnosed health condition.

    "text": "Not getting enough protein? You might feel it in more ways than one. Protein helps make you feel full, helps build lean muscle (bodybuilders rely on protein for muscle hypertrophy), and can help you recover after a particularly intense workout, among many benefits. Studies also show that higher-protein diets can support weight loss when compared to a lower-protein diet. ( 1 ) No matter what kind of brand or type of protein you wind up choosing, the best protein powders are super convenient for adding protein to your diet. If you’d rather get your protein from eggs and not the most common whey protein, then you’ve got options! Our team personally tested some of the best egg white protein powders and narrowed it down to the top five, each earning a specific badge of honor. Let’s get into the eggy-gritty. Medical disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Our team of dietitians, personal trainers, athletes, and other health enthusiasts come together to analyze and test different protein powders for our reviews. Here, we’ve narrowed it down from over 100 protein powders before deciding on the top five best egg white protein powders. Following BarBend’s s upplement testing methodology , our team considers some of the most important factors in choosing a protein powder: Boasting 30 grams of protein per serving, Bulk Supplements Egg White Protein Powder is easy to digest and free from lactose. At only 110 calories per serving, this is a geared toward building lean muscle. The formulation of this protein powder, which earned the designation of best egg white protein overall, is pretty simple: egg white protein, sunflower lecithin, and monk fruit sweetener. Given these ingredients, Bulk Supplements Egg White Protein is suitable for the paleo diet and is keto-friendly. Just be wary of the sodium content, encourages registered dieitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois: “The sodium content in this protein powder is worth noting. You get 440 mg per serving, almost 20 percent of your recommended daily limit.” Bulk Supplements is a popular brand with several nutrition supplements and products, each of which is third-party tested for purity and safety. You’ll pay a bit more for this particular egg white protein powder, though – it’s the most expensive per serving in our lineup at nearly $2 per serving. Our product tester, a certified nutrition coach, has this to say about their experience using Bulk Supplements Egg White Protein: “I’ve gotta say, I don’t love this with just water. It’s not the strongest egg taste, but you definitely know what you’re drinking — plus, it’s salty. It’s much better if you bake with it, make oatmeal with it, or even toss it into a smoothie . Seriously, just don’t have it by itself. On its own, the taste is a 2 out of 5.” Egg white protein powder isn’t as soluble as some of the best whey protein powders, which are more widely utilized than egg white protein powders. Our product tester notes, “After mixing with a shaker bottle, it’s going to basically look like liquid egg whites, especially where it foams on the top. After you get through the foam layer on top, though, it’s pretty thin. A 2 out of 5 for solubility.” Other small details that you might not think about, such as the packaging of a product, can also impact its usability. Our tester picked up on these smaller details, saying, “In terms of accessibility, this one isn’t the best — the bag doesn’t reseal well, which isn’t great for ease of use or keeping it fresh. I’d definitely recommend putting it in another container.” When you need an unflavored protein powder, Nutricost Egg White Protein comes with 15 grams of protein per serving. It's only got one ingredient (egg white protein), bringing with it a natural boost of 224 mg of potassium and 230 mg of sodium. Nutricost Egg White Protein Powder is one of the best egg white protein powders for weight loss for a few reasons. First, it has a super simple ingredient list —  just pure egg white and nothing else! The lack of sweeteners means you can conveniently add extra protein to many of your favorite foods without imparting a sweet flavor. Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois notes that the protein content isn’t super high here, but that can be a good thing: “I love that this option is available for those who either don’t need as much protein between meals or who want to include more protein in their baked goods.” Matt Cummings, our expert product tester and BarBend fitness writer, used Nutricost Egg White Protein Powder with both water and milk and says, “I would definitely recommend mixing this milk over water. I suffered through the water mix, but it did not taste good. Milk at least gives it some texture and flavor. I mixed it in with scrambled eggs one time and it made a little mess, but when properly prepared, I think it would be a quick and easy protein boost.” While this particular egg white protein powder is unflavored, there is still a taste to it. Cummings explains that the protein powder has “No flavor, but I noticed the saltiness,” giving Nutricost Egg White Protein Powder a 2 out of 5 for flavor on its own. When used in scrambled eggs, though, Cummings gives it a 5 out of 5: “I didn’t even notice it.” Egg white protein powders aren’t known for being easily mixed into liquids like grass-fed whey protein (for example), which is why this scores a 2 out of 5 for solubility from Cummings, who summarizes: “I wouldn’t use this like a typical protein powder shake. It’s meant to be used as an egg replacement in cooking, so in that situation, I’m sure it would be fine. But the taste and solubility make it pretty tough to drink. I mixed a scoop in with scrambled eggs once and I would definitely use it that way.” An alternative to whey and casein protein powders, Naked Nutrition Naked Egg's fat-free formulation delivers 25 grams of protein, less than 2 grams of carbs, and 110 calories per serving. It's made from non-GMO chicken eggs that, according to the brand, are processed into a powder in under one day to retain a complete amino acid profile . Naked Nutrition Naked Egg earns the designation of best natural egg white protein powder because of its simple ingredient list and use of non-GMO chicken eggs. In addition to egg white powder, sunflower lecithin is added as an emulsifier, helping to improve its solubility. As an RD, I’d give it a 5 out of 5 for formulation because of its simple ingredients list and high protein content. Fellow RD Chelsea Rae Bourgeois agrees, saying, “ Naked Nutrition also does a great job of providing its consumers with information beyond the nutrition facts. I love that you can see the amino acid profile of this product. Knowledge is power, after all!” Kate Meier, certified personal trainer and BarBend editorial team member, is one of our product testers and has this to say about her experience using Naked Nutrition Naked Egg: “ I tried it two ways: First, I blended this with strawberries, banana, and Lactaid. You can taste a flavor there; it’s hard to pinpoint what it is. Then I tried it with a cup of hot, black coffee, which I threw in the blender, making the coffee a little frothy. I actually liked it better this way! All in, I’d give it a 3 out of 5 for flavor because there isn’t much there, which can be a good thing!” For solubility, Meier says, “I doubt anyone would mix this with just water, but I did to test solubility. It’s about a 3 out of 5; mixes decently enough, but with some very small flecks still there. In the smoothie , it was fine. This surprised me in a good way. If you need an alternative to whey or casein protein , this isn’t a bad option.” Rosie Borchert, BarBend fitness writer and another one of our expert testers, prefers using egg white protein in baking, noting, “This egg white protein powder didn’t form hard peaks when I used an electric hand mixer, however, when used in my egg white cups (because Starbucks is too expensive for my blood), they worked well. There isn’t a strong taste to this powder, which is a win.” True Nutrition Egg White Protein comes in at a whopping 27 grams of protein per serving in the unflavored variety. And there's plenty of variety here with 34 flavors to choose from, whether you prefer fruit flavors, chocolatey, or unexpected delights like Chocolate Churro and Frosted Carrot Cake. If you’re looking for the best-tasting egg white protein powder, look no further than True Nutrition Egg White Powder. With an almost overwhelming list of flavor options, True Nutrition earned the highest score for flavor among our top picks for best egg white protein powders. Matt Cummings, expert tester and BarBend fitness writer, gives it a 4 out of 5 for flavor: “I tried out the French Vanilla flavor. The vanilla wasn’t overwhelming, but I definitely noticed it — in a good way.” While many of the other best egg white protein powders might be better suited for baking or mixing into foods, Cummings encourages trying this one on its own — “I recommend trying this egg white protein powder with milk if you’re going to drink it. It could also be used in baking, just be mindful of the flavor.” While it tastes better than some of our other top picks on its own, this egg white powder is still tricky to blend into a smooth consistency. Cummings has this to say about its solubility: “It mixed pretty well, but there were a few clumps remaining. I just shook it up before each sip.” I like that these are high in protein per serving (it’s similar to the protein content of some of the best whey isolates ), but I don’t love the use of artificial flavors and other added ingredients in some of the flavored options. Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois explains: “I’m a huge fan of chocolate, but the sodium content in their Chocolate Fudge Brownie flavor is a deal breaker for me. You get 490 milligrams per serving, which is more than 20 percent of the recommended limit for the average healthy adult. And it’s not the only flavor high in sodium. Do your research before ‘adding to cart!’” “ Like other egg white protein powders, True Nutrition Egg White Powder is higher in sodium than some of the more common protein powders like whey protein. That’s not because of any added salt, though — it’s just the natural sodium content of egg whites, which becomes more concentrated in powder form. At 16 grams of high-quality protein per serving, NOW Sports Egg White Protein only packs 80 calories into each serving, leaving a lot more room for whatever else you want in your meal plan. It's GMP quality-assured and is tested for over 220 banned substances. If you’re a big fan of eggs, why not add them to your smoothies in a safe way (not drinking them raw)? You can do just that with NOW Sports Egg White Powder, which earned its title as the best egg white protein powder for smoothies. Given that the only ingredient is egg white powder, I give it a 5 out of 5 for formulation since there aren’t any additives or artificial ingredients. While lower in protein compared to other egg white protein powders (16g of protein per serving), that’s not necessarily a bad thing if you’re adding it to smoothies. The best protein shakes or smoothies can often have other high-protein ingredients like Greek yogurt or nut butter, so you don’t necessarily have to rely on the protein from the protein powder alone. Like many of the egg white protein powders on our list, this one doesn’t fare too well in terms of taste when used on its own. Our expert tester, a certified nutrition coach, says: “I hate to say it, but, yuck, taste-wise. It’s got big sulfur vibes, with eggy smells and taste. I was surprised because I’m a fan of NOW supplements. This only gets a 2 out of 5 for taste.” Not surprising for a plain egg white powder, NOW Sports Egg White Powder doesn’t mix great in water. From our product tester: “It only gets a 1 out of 5 for solubility. The whole bottle filled up with foam like I’d whipped an egg white instead of tried to stir in protein powder.” However, it’s important to note that you likely won’t have as much of a frothy reaction when you mix the protein powder into a smoothie versus plain water. Despite lower taste and solubility scores, our tester adds a positive note: “The good thing here? While it’s low in protein for a protein powder at 16 grams, it’s also only got 80 calories” , which is also a pro if you’re adding it to smoothies without wanting to add a significant amount of calories. There are a lot of health benefits of eggs , including their rich protein content and concentration of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA). While they aren’t a fit for vegans, eggs are compliant with many other special diets — even the Mediterranean diet allows egg whites! While this isn’t an exhaustive list, let’s look at some of the benefits of egg white protein powders. The best egg white protein powders vary in price, and those small differences in cents can add up in your budget when you use protein powder consistently. The cheapest egg white protein powder is a little over $1 per serving when purchased in bulk (a 5 pound canister) while the most expensive in our lineup is closer to $2 per serving. Egg white protein powders can be a good choice for some, but they aren’t suitable for everyone. There are some unique considerations when using egg white protein powder. While egg white protein powder is a great alternative to more traditional protein powders for things like milk and soy allergies, you’ll need to steer clear of them if you have an egg allergy. Otherwise, egg white protein powder is gluten-free and lactose-free, and it’s generally well-tolerated with few side effects thanks to its higher digestibility. Egg whites are a natural source of sodium (55 milligrams of sodium per egg white, according to the USDA), so some of the best egg white protein powders are high in sodium (some are as high as 20% of the recommended daily value). Consuming a high-sodium diet can be potentially harmful if you have certain health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, or kidney issues. As always, consult your healthcare provider before trying a new protein supplement if you have dietary restrictions. (One of the good news about egg white protein powder is that it’s free of cholesterol since the cholesterol in eggs is from the yolks, not the whites!) Unlike a plant-based source of protein found in the best vegan protein powders or whey protein, egg white protein is notorious for not mixing super smoothly into liquids. Don’t expect a smooth, creamy protein shake if you mix egg white protein powder into water or milk. Instead, egg white protein powder can be a better fit for mixing into smoothies or using in baking, which is what many of our product testers prefer to do. Bulk Supplements Egg White Protein is one of the best egg white protein powders with a protein-rich, no added sugar formulation. Egg white protein powder is paleo-friendly and suitable for keto diets (as long as it’s free of regular sweeteners), and it’s also a good option if you have a milk allergy or sensitivities to dairy products. Egg white protein powder is a good source of high-quality protein, and unlike whey protein powder, it’s paleo-friendly. Egg white protein powder doesn’t mix as smoothly into water as other protein powders can, but it has the advantages of being milk- and soy-free. Due to its lower solubility, egg white protein powder is more suitable for adding to other foods to boost their protein content, such as when baking, versus drinking as a standalone protein shake. Egg white protein is composed of powdered egg whites, the most protein-rich part of the whole egg. So yes, egg white powder and egg white protein are the same! True Nutrition Egg White Powder earned our designation as the best-tasting egg white protein powder. This particular egg white protein powder earned the highest flavor score from our expert product testers, and there are tons of flavors to choose from, both with stevia and artificial sweetener options.

    "text": "If you’ve ever found yourself scrolling through social media (while resting between sets or otherwise), you’ve probably run across some extreme and divisive opinions about nutrition . After all, hot takes make headlines, and “everything in moderation,” while wise, is a bit boring and ambiguous. When it comes to making dietary choices as a strength athlete , specificity matters. The all-animal carnivore diet is no exception in this regard. This restrictive dietary practice seems to be all the rage lately and is touted by some as both a performance enhancer and a solution to numerous health issues, from hormonal “imbalances” to mood disorders .   A post shared by Paul Saladino, MD (@carnivoremd2.0) [Related: 9 Types of Diets Plus How They Work ] Your favorite powerlifter or weightlifter might be swearing by an all-meat diet. Even celebrities like Joe Rogan and Bear Grylls have tried it, but is the carnivore diet really worth taking a bite out of? Editor’s Note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. When starting a new training regimen and/or diet, it is always a good idea to consult with a trusted medical professional. We are not a medical resource. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. They are not substitutes for consulting a qualified medical professional. The carnivore diet, much like other niche dietary practices , hinges on the idea that certain micro or macronutrients are unnecessary or even debilitating with regard to improving health outcomes or athletic performance . Opting to eschew carbohydrates almost entirely, the carnivore diet is based on the consumption of animal flesh, organs, eggs, and small amounts of low-lactose dairy . Few to no vegetables, no processed food, and nothing that comes in a cardboard box or sealed in a plastic bag.   A post shared by Liver King (@liverking) [Related: Watch the Stoltman Brothers Tag-Team a 20,000-Calorie Breakfast ] In essence, the carnivore diet bears strong resemblance to some types of ketogenic diets , since both attempt to remove carbohydrate and processed foods as much as possible, though some carnivore proponents do incorporate scant amounts of carbs based on their personal tolerance. Influencers and fitness figures ranging from people like Dr. Paul Saladino to Brian Johnson (who goes by the moniker “Liver King”) go to bat for the carnivore diet on a regular basis. But do they have the backing of the scientific community? Proponents of the carnivore diet claim that its tenets are supported by substantial evidence, but the fact is that research on the carnivore diet specifically — and its relevance to strength athletes or recreational lifters — is scant. However, there is an enormous amount of literature on dietary practices that closely mirror what the carnivore diet is all about. Scientific papers on meat-only diets date back almost a century to a landmark case study conducted on Arctic explorers in the 1920s who followed a meat-only meal plan for a full year. For those explorers, prolonged meat exclusivity led to temporary insulin resistance , more uric acid in the blood , and less fecal biodiversity , which are far from being considered a perk package. However, they did also maintain healthy kidney function , experience reductions in body weight , and possess more physical “vigor.” ( 1 ) Modern studies on low-to-no-carbohydrate dietary interventions do display notable weight loss and improvements in some markers of cardiovascular health (though these metrics aren’t significantly different from a more traditional diet). However, much of this research is carried out on subjects who suffer from chronic diseases or are obese, and thus may not be relevant for healthy, active athletes. ( 2 ) Self-reported data from an online survey of meat-only eaters showed improvements in health and well-being, reductions in Body Mass Index (BMI) values, a reduced reliance on diabetic medication, and elevated cholesterol. ( 3 ) However, due to the research being conducted via survey rather than in direct clinical observation, there’s no way to empirically determine whether or not the diet itself created these effects. Respondents may have simply been reporting on things that happened to correlate with what they ate at the time. Notably, some literature does draw a correlation (note: not a causative relationship) between high meat intake and mood disorders, incidences of colorectal cancer, and all-cause mortality. Although many studies do infer that consuming animal meat may not be harmful in large quantities , they don’t conclusively comment on meat-only diets. ( 4 )( 5 )( 6 ) With little in the way of solid and specific evidence to fall back on, it’s hard to say exactly how the carnivore diet really affects your health as a strength athlete or dedicated gymgoer . Though the carnivore diet does provide many if not all essential nutrients your body needs to survive, it may fall short of meeting current dietary recommendations . Meat exclusivity may lead to deficiencies in vitamin C and calcium, which may create unwanted health outcomes such as chronic fatigue or fever. ( 7 ) As such, a comprehensive multivitamin could be of use in some cases. Many dietary habits that stigmatize, prohibit, or exclude certain foods or food groups may lead to a worsening of your relationship with food as a whole. While powerlifters and bodybuilders alike are familiar with what it takes to cut weight for a meet or prep for a big show , a rigid or restrictive approach to your diet long-term may cause undue mental stress. ( 8 ) Low-carbohydrate diets (which the carnivore diet certainly counts as) have been repeatedly shown to improve certain markers of cardiovascular health . However, a highly-specific diet as a means of bolstering your heart may be overkill if you’re metabolically healthy. ( 2 ) For healthy populations, paleo-esque diets — meal plans that omit foods not naturally found on Earth — do tend to create weight loss and improve blood lipid profiles, but this may be due to reducing the consumption of highly-processed foods, rather than the merits of the diet itself. ( 9 ) The carnivore diet may have a negative impact on your gut health . By removing carbohydrates and fermentable fiber, you might experience lower amounts of protective postbiotics, which help manage internal bacteria. Plant foods have also been shown to have a positive influence on your risk of colorectal cancer later in life as well. ( 10 )( 11 ) Conversely, one case study on the carnivore diet did showcase some potentially positive outcomes related to gut microbiome and bloating, but more research is needed to confirm this kind of finding. ( 12 ) Following an all-meat diet may provide some relief if you experience regular bloating or gas, but there are also less-extreme ways of treating those conditions, such as adjusting your meal frequency or drinking more water . Some proponents of the carnivore diet note that it can be used to treat certain autoimmune conditions, but these claims haven’t been substantiated in a clinical setting. As many autoimmune conditions go through regular flare-ups and remission cycles, it’s possible to conflate a coincidental change in your food preferences as being the source of a temporary improvement. ( 13 ) If you enjoy lifting weights , you probably rely on the energy from carbs more than you think to bust through a squat plateau or squeeze out one last rep on the bench press . However, some athletes exhibit impressive feats of strength and muscularity while also claiming to follow a meat-exclusive diet. While certain endurance-based activities (think everything from CrossFit to distance running) usually require carbohydrates to support performance at a high level, it is possible for strength athletes to perform well in their sport of choice on the carnivore diet (or a ketogenic diet). Carbohydrates are great for fueling your expression of strength in the gym, but they aren’t an essential source of fuel for resistance training. ( 14 ) If you’re in the gym to change your physique or bulk up , the carnivore diet may prove to be a detriment to your training sessions. Diets that eschew carbohydrates may negatively impact longer workouts (think 45 minutes or more), or training sessions that contain high amounts of volume (in excess of 10 working sets). ( 14 )( 15 ) That aside, if you can manage to adequately tax your muscles in the gym without the fuel provided by carbohydrates, you can still grow . Dietary protein and calories are the main nutritional factors when it comes to hypertrophy , so as long as you eat enough, the carnivore diet is fair game. Strength athletes who work with the barbell might fare a bit better on the carnivore diet than an intermediate or advanced bodybuilder. That said, it’s still not ideal in all situations. If you train more than once per day , for instance, you might find it difficult to recover enough muscle glycogen between workouts without relying on an external carb source. Should you require high amounts of volume to increase your lifts , the naturally longer workouts might run across the same conditions that would hamper a bodybuilder. It can be hard to push through a two-hour session if you neglect carbohydrates or certain micronutrients . Further, adopting the carnivore diet early into a specific strength program might stymie your progress as you get deeper into a high-volume block that has you banging out a lot of squats or deadlifts in a single workout. The further you are into your strength career, the more volume (and higher intensity ) you need to make progress. That benchmark might preclude you from adopting the carnivore diet long-term. ( 15 ) The carnivore diet has a flashy name and, at a glance, may seem alluring if you’re after a no-frills dietary plan . After all, it’s easier and more convenient to stick to one food or food group exclusively. Your favorite lifter might even be going to bat for the carnivore diet on Instagram, which can certainly add to the appeal. Remember, though, that a diet or workout someone follows now doesn’t necessarily mean they used it to get where they are. It’s easier to maintain muscle and strength than to achieve it in the first place, after all. With a limited amount of specific research on the subject, the jury is out on whether the carnivore diet really sizzles for strength athletes. It may create certain beneficial outcomes by “accident” or help you avoid processed foods , but may run afoul of certain negative outcomes along the way. The best way to separate the meat from the bone (figuratively and literally) is with your teeth — consider the evidence, think hard, and if the carnivore diet sounds appropriate for you, bite down. 1.

    "text": "Strongman diets are often extremely caloric , frequently reaching five figures. 2018 World’s Strongest Man (WSM) and current deadlift record holder Hafthor Björnsson recently invited Dr. Mike Israetel to evaluate his daily meals . Björnsson’s day starts with one and a half liters of water mixed with Hydrate, an electrolyte powder , and creatine . His daily nutrition plan consists of five meals, which are organized when he wakes up and coordinated with his workout schedule. Björnsson consumes approximately 400 grams of protein en route to 8,000 daily calories . “I used to eat 10,000 calories daily . When I was younger, I was more active and needed more calories,” Björnsson recalled. “Now, I am old, lazy, and eat only 8,000.” Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Meal one contains approximately 1,640 calories, earning Israetel’s approval as a quintessential bodybuilding meal. When Björnsson feels sluggish during training, removing olive oil or another easily-controllable, high-calorie condiment from his diet can help alleviate the issue. Björnsson’s second meal packs approximately 1,390 calories. High-calorie liquid additions to meals make strongman dieting easier,” Dr. Israetel said. Meal three provides approximately 1,350 calories. For meals four and five, Björnsson repeats meals two and three. His current meal plan has resulted in noticeable gains in strength and size, fueling him to attempt another deadlift world record at the 2025 World Deadlift Championships on Sept. 6, 2025, in Las Vegas, NV.

    "text": "Supplementing with one of the best protein powders is often integral to those hoping to pack on muscle mass during a bulking phase. Of course, not just any protein powder will do. With such fitness goals, you’ll need a supp that’s low in sugar but high in calories (and, of course, protein), as each of those calories has to count. You may ask how you’re going to find the time between work and your regimented exercise routine to research the deluge of protein powders on the market. Lucky for you, BarBend ’s team of trainers, lifters, and fitness fanatics have tested hundreds of supps to find the best protein powders for weight gain. Read on for our picks. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D. , a registered dietitian nutritionist with 10 years of experience in the clinical setting, contributed to this article by evaluating products. Staci Gublin, R.D., who has been a registered dietitian since 2010, wrote this article and personally researched studies that support or debunk brand claims. The BarBend team is made up of certified personal trainers, weightlifting coaches, and competitive athletes. To determine the best protein powders for weight gain available today, we’ve tested nearly 100 different profiles from the industry’s best brands, utilizing the BarBend Supplement Testing Methodology to rate each profile on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Below are some of the categories and components that played into our rankings. The major factor that separates your run-of-the-mill protein powder from a protein powder for weight gain is the calorie content. “Gaining muscle comes down to protein plus calories plus progressive overload,” said biochemist Trever Kashey, Ph.D. when discussing mass gainer pros and cons with BarBend . Since it’s likely you’ll be working hard in the gym, additional calories are necessary to help you put on mass, rather than lose it. Research suggests that 300 to 500 calories or more daily on top of basic calorie needs is ideal for muscle growth — or hypertrophy. ( 1 )( 2 ) Studies also show that calorie surpluses within this range are most ideal for muscle weight gain without gaining too much fat during the bulking process. ( 3 ) We sought to include supplements with higher-than-usual calorie ranges. Many protein powders contain between 100 and 200 calories per serving, but our picks have a much wider range, with standard protein powders delivering between 100 and 300 calories per serving and mass gainers and meal replacements spanning roughly 450 to 1,300 calories per serving. Further studies show that those over the age of 65 years old consuming between 1.2 to 1.59 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight and adults less than 65 years of age consuming greater than 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight had the most significant lean muscle mass when undergoing resistance exercise. ( 4 ) As such, our picks include more grams of protein than traditional protein powders, which tend to supply between 15 and 25 grams per serving. To support bulking goals, many of our picks have between 40 and 55 grams of protein per serving. And since research shows that around 3 grams of leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, for every 25 grams of whey protein can help sustain muscle synthesis for up to five hours, we prioritized products with a strong BCAA profile. ( 5 )( 6 ) We also looked for powders that also include creatine, which research has shown can help increase energy stores for better muscular contractions, not to mention support recovery between workouts. ( 7 ) If you’re interested in learning more about some of the best mass gainers we’ve tested, check out the below video with BarBend’s Jake Herod, NASM-CNC . Finally, it’s important to note that protein powders and mass gainers are not meant to replace whole foods in your diet, but rather to simplify the process of increasing your calorie intake. “The best way to gain muscle is to eat a well-balanced diet that consists of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, protein, and healthy fats,” Natalie Rizzo, a registered dietitian, told BarBend . “Choose high-quality protein, like poultry, fish, soy, beans, and legumes.” For any dietary supplement, we look at third-party testing. This means that the product has been tested by a third party to ensure that what’s on the label is what you’ll actually get in each scoop. Third-party testing provides the consumer assurance that the product is safe and pure. Third-party testing may come from an independent lab. In other cases, third-party testing may be done by certification companies like the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) or Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). Other certificates you can trust include Informed Choice, which tests for banned substances for athletes, among other compounds. We prioritized protein powders and mass gainers with evidence of third-party testing. If a product hasn’t been tested, but is still on our list, that’s because the brand has a solid reputation that has earned our trust. Whenever possible, BarBend conducted its own independent testing to determine a product’s presence of heavy metals, bisphenols, phthalates, and pesticides. When we had results to share, we included them below. For the effects of any supplement to show, you’ll need to commit to it for a period of time. As such, you want a product that fits into your budget. When making our list, we looked at not only the total price of a protein powder container, but the price per serving of each protein powder. The pricier products on our list tend to have third-party testing and added compounds like BCAAs and creatine. When making our list, though, we looked for brands with subscribe and save options that can help lower the cost of a given product. High on protein, low on fat, and containing no artificial ingredients, this clean mass gainer should sit well in almost anyone's stomach. Your most challenging choice is whether you want Sweet Vanilla or Chocolate Glaze Donut. Transparent Labs Mass Gainer is our pick for the best protein powder for weight gain overall. At 750 calories and 53 grams of protein per serving, this product is an ideal meal replacement or potent post-workout protein shake . We also like the 3 grams of creatine monohydrate per serving, as creatine, one of the most-studied supplements on the market, has been shown to help increase muscle strength, muscle mass, and athletic performance. ( 8 ) Our testers scored the formulation a 4.25 out of 5. This protein powder is non-GMO, gluten-free, and free from preservatives. It also contains just 12 grams of sugar per serving, which is fairly low for the calorie content you’re receiving. The downsides of Transparent Labs Mass Gainer are the saturated fat and sodium content, as well as the price. “Two things give me pause with Transparent Labs Mass Gainer — its sodium and saturated fat contents,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “ Each serving provides 590 milligrams of sodium and 12 grams of saturated fat. There’s a lot to unpack there, but to keep it short, if heart health is a concern, you should be mindful of how frequently you use this powder.” It also costs roughly $5 per serving, which is well above the $1 to $2 average you tend to see with the average protein powder. That said, you’re going to pack on a lot more mass with this product than a standard whey protein powder, so our testers found the price justifiable, scoring it a 4 out of 5. As far as taste, some customer reviews take issue with the aftertaste of the Sweet Vanilla flavor. Our testers sampled the Chocolate Glaze Donut and had no issues with the taste or solubility, with both scoring a 5 out of 5. Finally, we also like the addition of MCT oil, as it helps aid with absorption and works to provide gut support. ( 9 ) Read the full Transparent Labs Mass Gainer Review . Legion's Casein+ has more protein per calorie than any other casein we've seen, plus it has no artificial ingredients. Each serving provides 5.2 grams of branch chain amino acids. Casein protein digests slower than whey protein, meaning you may feel fuller for longer after a dose. ( 10 ) Legion Casein+ is one of the best casein proteins we’ve tested because it pairs an above-average dose of 24 to 26 grams of protein per serving with 11.4 grams of muscle-boosting essential amino acids. It’s also made from naturally-sourced ingredients, including dairy sourced from hormone- and antibiotic-free Irish cows, and was tested by third-party labs. We scored the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. It is fairly low in calories at 110 to 140 calories per serving, so those looking to pack on pounds may benefit from blending it with milk, yogurt, or healthy fats like nut butter to boost its calorie content. The upside of this low calorie content is that it is also very low in sugar at only 2 net carbohydrates and 1 gram of added sugar per serving. This low sugar content would make it an ideal option for a low-carb lifestyle. Based on our own testing, we graded Casein+ at a C overall for purity. This protein sample scored in the top 50 percent among all sampled powders for heavy metals, and the top 10 percent for the presence of bisphenols, phthalates, and pesticides. Our tester utilized this product as a meal replacement and found it satisfying. They mixed the Dutch Chocolate flavor with water, noting that it mixed decently but separated from the water after being left unattended for 20 minutes. Casein is naturally much thicker than whey proteins , so you’ll want to use a blender (or shake really hard ) when mixing this one. “It reminds me of a dark chocolate that is not too rich or too sweet,” said our tester. “The texture with water is a normal thickness, but the aftertaste is very chalky. It lines your mouth with a dry, chalky texture.” Taste scored a 4 out of 5, while solubility got a 3.5 out of 5. If you want to offset that chalkiness, we’d recommend mixing it with milk and yogurt. Some customers have also complained about the aftertaste of the monk fruit sweetener in this powder, so that’s also worth taking into consideration. Read the full Legion Casein + Review . This mass gainer is packed with calories and is among the best-tasting mass gainer products we've tried. You can get it in chocolate or vanilla flavors. Crazy Nutrition Mass Gainer is one of the best-tasting protein powders we’ve tried. It’s only available in Chocolate and Vanilla, but the classics are classics for a reason. Our tester, a certified personal trainer and weightlifting coach, found the Vanilla flavor of this mass gainer to have a “pleasurable and satisfying taste” that, unlike other vanilla-flavored protein powders, captured its sweetness and creaminess when blended with water or milk. They scored it a 4 out of 5 for taste. “It’s only available in Chocolate and Vanilla, but they do those traditional flavors very well,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. Each serving contains roughly 500 calories, 40 grams of protein, and 55 grams of carbs, which our testers found a touch low for the $4.49 per serving price. That said, they thought it would be a good fit for smaller athletes who don’t need more than 700 or 800 calories in a shake. Formulation scored a 3 out of 5. “It’s a little bit higher in fat content, which is where that rich, creamy flavor is coming from,” adds Bourgeois . “The fat source comes from MCT oil , which we know can offer a lot of really good health benefits .” ( 11 ) We do, however, like its incorporation of vitamins B6 and B12 for an energy boost, as well as the zinc and magnesium for immune health support. Its low sugar count — just 8.45 grams per serving — helps, too. That oat flour, however, can settle at the bottom in a blender bottle, so we’d recommend using an actual blender for this one. As such, we scored its solubility a 2 out of 5. If whey protein tends to upset your stomach, Crazy Nutrition works to offset that with DigeZyme, a blend of five enzymes that may help improve absorption and ease any digestive discomfort. ( 12 ) That said, it’s worth noting that one of our testers with a lactose intolerance did experience some “stomach bubbles” afterwards, though another tester with no intolerance felt fine. Naked Nutrition's whey is grass-fed and it’s made without acids, heat, bleach, or growth hormone. Other ingredients include organic tapioca maltodextrin, whey protein concentrate, micellar casein, organic coconut sugar, and organic cacao powder. Naked Nutrition Naked Mass is a super high-calorie protein powder for weight gain. At 1,230 to 1,360 calories per four-scoop serving — depending on flavor and formula — this product is for those looking for fast bulking support from a product that’s free from artificial additives. Whether you go for Naked’s whey protein blend or vegan protein blend, the formula will contain no soy, gluten, GMOs, or artificial sweeteners. The purity of its trim ingredients lists have been certified by Informed Sport, a third-party testing agency. In addition to its high calorie count, each serving of this mass gainer includes 50 grams of protein, around 250 grams of carbs, and impressive doses of iron and calcium, though those will differ based on your desired flavor and formulation. It should go without saying this is not one of the best low-carb protein powders . “ Naked Mass provides around 250 grams of carbs per serving, which is a pretty hefty amount of carbs for one sitting. Definitely meant for a specific customer base,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “I do like that they kept the sodium content low in some flavors of their mass gainer formula, and I’m a fan of the short ingredient lists.” Bourgeois scored its formulation a 4 out of 5, but noted that some of the available flavors are “super high in saturated fat and sodium.” She added, “You definitely need to be mindful of your overall diet when including such a nutrient-dense dietary supplement in your routine.” Our tester, a USA Weightlifting Level-2 coach, wasn’t impressed by the taste or solubility of this mass gainer when mixed with water or milk, scoring each category a 2 out of 5. However, when mixed with a smoothie — in their case, 12 ounces of milk, peanut butter, cocoa powder, and half a banana — those scores jumped up to a 4 out of 5 for taste and a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “Mix it in a smoothie and you’re off to the races,” they said. “I didn’t experience any protein aftertaste.” Dymatize Super Mass keeps calories high, packing plenty of carbs and protein per serving. This is also a budget-friendly option for those who can't spend a ton on their supplements. If you’re looking to bulk up fast, Dymatize Super Mass Gainer might just become your best pal. Each serving of this high-calorie whey protein powder contains 1,280 calories, 52 grams of a whey and casein protein blend, and 245 grams of carbs. Since most people only require 300 to 500 calories per serving to help support muscle hypertrophy, we’d recommend this one primarily for bodybuilders. ( 1 ) (If you’re unsure about whether you need this many calories, add your stats into this calorie calculator .) Our testers scored the formulation a 3.5 out of 5. We like that each serving contains 10.7 grams of BCAAs, including 5.1 grams of leucine, which has been shown to help sustain muscle synthesis. ( 5 )( 6 ) It also contains 25% or more of the daily recommended value of seven vitamins and minerals, along with smaller servings of ten others. And our testers report no side effects or bloating after consuming this product. “I dug the Rich Chocolate flavor. Not too sweet and definitely tickled my sweet tooth,” said our tester, giving it a 4.8 out of a 5 for taste. That said, they found it thin with milk and even worse in water, finding it most palatable as part of a smoothie. They also found it lumpy when mixed in anything aside from a blender. “In a blender, I give a 4 out of 5 for solubility, but in a shaker cup I’d knock it a point — 3 out of 5,” they said. At $4.75 per serving, it’s reasonably priced for a mass gainer, but each tub only contains around eight servings. If you plan on taking this for a prolonged period of time, you’ll need to re-up on a consistent basis, and those costs can add up. As such, we only scored its value a 3 out of 5. This mass gainer contains 1,250 calories per serving, 100 percent of the recommended daily intake of most vitamins and minerals, and 50 percent of your daily v itamin D , which is important for testosterone. We like Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass for athletes because it pairs its calorie- and protein-dense formula with doses of creatine and glutamine. Research has shown creatine can help increase muscle strength, muscle mass, and athletic performance, and studies have found links between glutamine and improved athletic performance. ( 8 )( 13 ) “I like that Optimum Nutrition includes 5 grams of creatine in every serving of their Serious Mass supplement,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “For a supplement meant to support weight gain , including creatine helps put on muscle mass . I also like that they kept the formula pretty low in fat. Many mass gainer supplements include a significant amount of saturated fat to boost the calories, and that’s not the case here.” She scored the formulation a 4 out of 5, specifically shouting out the “impressive vitamin and mineral profile,” which includes vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and E, as well as calcium, iron, and magnesium. That said, she notes that this product is “not for everyone” and “meant for a very specifically targeted demographic.” She adds, “Its macro content is skewed compared to its total calories per serving.” [Related: Best Supplements for Muscle Growth ] Based on our own testing, we graded Serious Mass at a C overall for purity. This protein sample scored in the top 50 percent among all sampled powders for heavy metals, and the top 10 percent for the presence of bisphenols, phthalates, and pesticides. As far as texture goes, our tester said that it didn’t mix well manually with a spoon or in a blender bottle. Therefore, they recommend blending the product. However, the downside to blending is that it creates a high volume of product that can be hard to consume over the course of a day. They scored it a 4 out of 5 for solubility. Our tester scored the Vanilla flavor a 3.5 out of 5 for taste. “It tastes like your standard artificial vanilla. Nothing special. It wasn’t too sweet, but I did get sick of it pretty fast.” They experienced a bit of gassiness at first, but that passed relatively quickly. Read our full Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass Review . With 32 grams of protein per serving, this impressive protein powder can help you achieve your nutritional goals while serving as a satiating option in-between meals. Additionally, the formulation utilizes whey and casein protein to reap fast-releasing and slow-releasing benefits in one fell swoop. If you’re looking to put on weight, but overwhelmed by the calorie counts (and prices) of the typical mass gainer, Muscle Milk Genuine Protein Powder can meet you in the middle. For roughly $2 per serving — more than half the cost of the average mass gainer — this protein powder delivers between 280 and 290 calories and 32 grams of protein to assist with hypertrophy . “ Muscle Milk packs 32 grams of protein into each scoop of their Genuine Protein Powder, which I think is pretty remarkable,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “But the fact that it includes all nine essential amino acids is even more impressive. I also love that it’s NSF-certified for sport and that it contains impressive amounts of vitamins A, C, and D .” Based on our own testing, we graded Muscle Milk Genuine Protein Powder at a C overall for purity. This protein sample scored in the top 50 percent among all sampled powders for heavy metals, and the top 10 percent for the presence of bisphenols, phthalates, and pesticides. Though we like that it’s low in sugar, it does contain 9 grams of fat and 21 grams of carbs. “For those who want to boost their protein intake without skewing their carb and fat intake, this may not be the protein powder for you,” says Bourgeois. It also contains some artificial flavors and additives, which knocked Bourgeois’ formulation score down to a 3.75 out of 5. Our testers tried the Vanilla Crème flavor and found it mild, but sweet. They added that the two scoops per serving is a lot of powder to dissolve and can produce a grainy and chalky texture. It didn’t clump, though, so there’s that. Our testers scored this product a 3.75 out of 5 for both taste and solubility. This tasty meal replacement packs 490 calories and 40 grams of protein per serving. It also prioritizes low-glycemic carbs and healthy fats, and has been third-party tested by Informed Sport to verify the purity of its formulation. Though we always recommend athletes get their macros from whole foods, sometimes that isn’t an option. If you’re in need of one of the best meal replacements to help you stay on track with your weight gain goals, we recommend Bare Performance Nutrition Strong Food, which packs 490 calories and 40 grams of protein into every serving. After testing it personally and researching the list of ingredients, BarBend editorial member Ben Emminger scored the formulation a 4 out of 5. We also like that it prioritizes low-glycemic carbohydrates via the inclusion of gluten-free oat powder and sweet potato powder. Its healthy fats, meanwhile, come from MCT powder, flaxseed, and macadamia nut oil powder. MCT is a smart addition to a meal replacement, in particular, as research has shown it can help people feel fuller. ( 14 ) That said, each serving does contain 11 grams of saturated fat and 410 milligrams of sodium per serving, which may not be ideal for those on a heart-healthy eating plan. Emminger scored this product’s taste a 4.5 out of 5, saying, “The Chocolate offering is a nice treat that’s not too sweet or overbearing. I really enjoyed mixing it with milk in a blender for a creamier consistency and flavor profile.” Solubility scored a 3.5 out of 5. “Each serving calls for three rather large scoops, and finding a blender bottle that can house this much product at once can be a pain,” he said. “I’d recommend investing in a countertop blender if you’d like to consume this powder regularly.” The Bare Performance Nutrition Strong Food is certified by Informed Sport. This means that it is tested to ensure no banned substances are in this product. This makes it a safe product for athletes and fitness enthusiasts alike. Emminger scored this product a 5 out of 5 for third-party testing. Iron Vegan Athlete’s Gainer contains a potent 720 calories and 42 grams of protein per serving to help support muscle weight gain . And with pea and brown rice proteins providing fiber and vital nutrients, this product is suited for a plant-based diet. Iron Vegan Athlete’s Gainer — among the best vegan protein powders we’ve tested — derives a complete protein profile from fermented pea protein isolate and organic sprouted brown rice protein concentrate, making this a vegan-friendly protein powder for weight gain. Each serving contains 42 grams of non-GMO plant-based protein, 720 calories, and 13 grams of fiber, and is certified vegan, kosher, and gluten-free. Athlete’s Gainer’s 120 grams of carbs per serving come from healthy, plant-based sources, including organic whole grains (millet, quinoa, amaranth), organic vegetables (kale, spinach), and fruit concentrates like tart cherry, which has been studied for its muscle recovery benefits. ( 15 ) Overall, this supp has a carb-to-protein ratio of 2.85:1. After using this product and researching its list of ingredients, BarBend editorial member Ben Emminger scored the formulation a 4 out of 5. “There are only two flavors to choose from, and there is a little aftertaste from the stevia leaf extract,” said Emminger. “However, the consistency is pretty nice and I didn’t notice any unpleasant textures in my shake post-mixing. The two scoops of powder are more manageable than other mass gainers , which helps keep this shake more milkshake than concrete.” He scored taste a 3.5 out of 5 and solubility a 4 out of 5. [Related: Best Organic Protein Powders ] Emminger was also impressed by Athlete’s Gainer Informed Sport certification, which means Iron Vegan isn’t lying about what’s on the label and that the product contains no banned substances. It received a 5 out of 5 for third-party testing. If you’re wondering how to bulk up, the first step is to recalibrate your diet so you’re intentionally consuming more calories than you require. You can’t put on lean body mass without a caloric surplus. Of course, you want to do so in a responsible and strategic way — that means lots of protein and a healthy balance of carbs and fats. Here are some ways protein powders for weight gain can help. Protein powders for weight gain can help you meet macro goals without having to spend all of your time in the kitchen. Protein powders come in a concentrated form, so you don’t need to consume a big plate of grilled chicken to receive the same amount of protein. Because of the protein content of such products, you can use this not just for muscle gain, but also to help you meet protein needs daily if you don’t get enough protein from whole foods. Most protein powders for weight gain contain carbs that are low glycemic, meaning they don’t spike blood sugars ( 16 ). These types of healthy carbs — think whole grains, sweet potatoes, and brown rice — also tend to be a good source of fiber, which helps support gut health and overall wellness. ( 17 ) Because of the high-calorie content you’ll find in protein powders for weight gain, such shakes can replace missed meals. This is especially true of mass gainers, which contain higher doses of macronutrients. “What mass gainers are really about is putting on weight and maximizing your calorie intake without having to eat a whole meal,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. We’d just encourage you not to make a habit of it, as the best macros come from whole meals. Bulking is a delicate dance, and athletes can put on as much fat as muscle if they’re not strategic when it comes to their diet, supplementation, and exercise. Here are some factors to consider when choosing the best protein powder for weight gain. Our list includes both traditional protein powders and mass gainers. The protein powders we’ve selected contain above-average calorie, carb, and protein counts, while the mass gainers have, well, a lot more than average. Before choosing one or the other, consider your fitness goals and just how much of a caloric surplus you need to meet your goals. If you’re unsure, plug your stats into this macros calculator . If you’re in a bulking phase or you’re what some call a “hardgainer” (someone who struggles to put on weight), a mass gainer can be useful for helping you consume enough calories, protein, and carbs to help you meet your training and weight-gain goals. If your goals are more casual, you likely don’t need the macro surplus provided by these supplements. It’s not uncommon for those taking a mass gainer to gain unwanted fat in addition to muscle. “ Mass gainers are great to bridge the gap, but try to avoid counting them as meal replacements on the regular,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “I would just say go for a well-balanced diet and let these supplements fill the gap as needed.” You’ll want to look at more than just calories and protein when deciding on a protein powder or mass gainer. Mass gainers, in particular, are not suitable for many types of diets . For example, they can often contain high doses of sodium, potassium, and saturated fat, which can be a negative for those adhering to a renal or heart-healthy diet. ( 18 ) In general, try to avoid products with more than 300 milligrams of sodium per serving. ( 19 ) Furthermore, since these types of supplements can often be used as meal replacements, you’ll want scoops with quality ingredients and loads of nutrients. That can include micronutrients like iron, magnesium, and A, B, and C vitamins, or even creatine and glutamine that can help you build muscle. Dietary supplements — especially ones so high in calories, carbs, and protein — may cause gastrointestinal distress, bloating, and nausea in some users. We made note of side effects in our testing — and called out any in our reviews — but everybody’s body is different, so you’ll want to take into account your own sensitivities before purchasing. Some supplements include digestive enzymes to help mitigate these side effects, while other brands include probiotics or gut-healthy ingredients. And while whey protein tends to be the go-to for protein powders, there are a number of plant-based options available to suit not just vegans, but also those with a lactose intolerance. The best protein powder for weight gain will contain at least 300 to 500 calories and at least 20 grams of protein per serving. ( 1 )( 20 )  It’s best if these proteins contain all nine essential amino acids for optimal muscle growth support. Our favorite is Transparent Labs Mass Gainer, which exceeds this criteria and includes 3 grams of creatine monohydrate to aid with muscle growth. If you’re not already taking one of the best creatine supplements , that’s a nice bonus. Protein powders for weight gain are convenient and effective. If you’re struggling to get the protein you need to gain weight or you’re coming in below your calorie goals for the day, a simple protein shake can give you a boost at home or on-the-go. Whey protein can support weight loss or weight gain, depending on the application of the product. Research shows that whey protein can be integrated into a weight loss program by providing a portable protein option or meal replacement. ( 21 ) However, research also shows that in a higher-calorie form, it can also be used to support muscle gain.

    "text": "Once a niche athletic supplement, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) have exploded in popularity as a means to potentially improve muscle retention, endurance, and focus during workouts. ( 5 ) Now as synonymous with supplementation as the best protein powders and pre-workouts, the best BCAA supplements offer key benefits encased in flavorful profiles at affordable costs. Given the landscape of the category, finding a proper BCAA powder or capsule for your training needs can be difficult at times. To lend a helping hand, we’ve called on our team of experts and diehard fitness enthusiasts to test over 20 BCAA supplements from top brands, examining each profile through the lens of our supplement testing methodology . This methodology includes, at a high level, having our experts look at the formulas to ensure that safe, research-backed ingredients are used. We also prioritize products that are third-party tested. In addition to this, our testing team evaluates their own personal experiences using these products, weighing factors like taste, texture, efficacy, price and convenience to provide real-world insights around the day-to-day experience with these supplements. We also consulted with Dr. Jennie Stanford, M.D. and Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD to make sure we understood the purpose of BCAA supplements and how to best analyze them. Each BCAA supplement chosen for this round-up was rated in major areas relative to the category, including: The BarBend team has helped connect over 1.6 million athletes with high-quality nutritional supplements to give them the boost they desire when it comes to health and wellness. If you’re searching for a new BCAA powder to add to your regular routine, we’re confident that the following details can help you shake up your supplementation (in a good way). Medical Disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. The BarBend team consistently tests new BCAA supplements to offer up-to-date recommendations to our audience. Our team, made up of registered dietitian nutritionists, certified personal trainers, and wellness experts, has tested over 20 BCAA supplements to date. This page was last updated in July 2025 to reflect our latest testing data. Join BarBend expert tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC, and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, as they discuss some of our favorite BCAA supplements for men, women, muscle growth, and more. With an outstanding formulation and numerous flavor options available, Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine earns our top pick for the best BCAA supplement. We love that this product is made without artificial flavors, dyes, and sweeteners. According to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, this formula contains the ideal BCAA ratio. “The 2:1:1 ratio is backed by research and the added glutamine offers some additional benefits,” she says, rating the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “While stevia is fine for most, some can’t tolerate it or don’t like the taste, which is good to keep in mind.” Each single scoop serving offers a whopping 8 grams of BCAAs. Transparent Labs also added coconut water powder, which is rich in electrolytes for hydration, and a high 5,000-milligram dose of l-glutamine to potentially reduce muscle soreness following a workout (making it one of the best glutamine supplements, as well). ( 12 ) This supplement also packs over 1,000% of your daily vitamin C needs to support a strong immune system. ( 16 ) A 30-serving tub costs around $39.99, which equates to roughly $1.33 per serving. This cost is more expensive than many other products you’ll find on this list. One reason the cost is so high, we assume, is because Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine is third-party tested. Third-party testing ensures you can trust that what’s on the label is what you’ll find in the actual formulation. Regarding taste, our testers and other verified reviewers have mixed opinions. Our certified health coach tried the Strawberry Lemonade and rated it a 3 out of 5. “ I found an initial taste that was bitter, and this particular flavor had a funky aftertaste,” she notes. Some tastier options for athletes may be Cellucor Alpha Amino and Nutricost BCAA. Transparent Labs dissolves exceptionally well in water, with our tester reporting no issues. “There weren’t any leftover powder clumps, it completely dissolved,” she says, giving it a perfect 5 out of 5 for solubility. Good for: Those wanting a robust formulation that’s third-party tested and free of artificial additives. Not good for: Those looking for a low-cost budget option. Read our full Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine Review . It’s not necessary to spend tons of money on supplements each month, especially for athletes with a tight budget. If you’re searching for an affordable BCAA supplement that won’t break the bank, our team recommends Nutricost BCAA Powder. This product starts at roughly $0.25 per serving, earning a 5 out of 5 rating for overall value. For additional discounts, you can subscribe to recurring deliveries. “These BCAAs score a 4 out of 5 for their formulation,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says. “They have a clinically dosed ratio of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, but they also contain artificial ingredients like sucralose, which may cause GI upset.” We also note that Nutricost BCAAs are just BCAAs, so don’t expect any added compounds to support weight loss, boosted energy or other goals. After taking this product three times per week, and mixing it with water, our expert product tester Kate Meier, CPT, didn’t notice any immediate effects. However, she didn’t experience any negative effects, either. “I tried the unflavored option and it wasn’t completely flavorless,” Meier said. “However, I’d still rate the flavor a 5 out of 5 because it mixes so well with other drinks. When you mix it with some of the best pre-workout supplements or a sports drink, it completely masks the BCAA powder .” We really liked the product’s solubility, too, rating this category a solid 5 out of 5. Meier mixed this product in both a shaker cup as well as with a common glass and spoon. “Either way that I mixed, the water was a little murky and there were some small grains in the texture, ” she said. “But in just a minute or two, it completely dissolved.” Of course, though, for those less enthused about having a shaker bottle handy for proper supplementation, we recommend looking at Crazy Muscle BCAA Pills. Good for: Individuals looking for a budget-friendly BCAA powder with costs per serving starting below $0.30. Not good for: Those looking to avoid artificial sweeteners. If you’re an active individual — especially one who breaks a serious sweat on a routine basis — then you need to prioritize hydration. Luckily, Snap Supplements BCAAs contain several ingredients that support this, including key ingredients typically found in some of the best electrolyte drinks . In addition to 5 grams of a vegan BCAA blend delivered in a 2:1:1 ratio of l-leucine, l-isoleucine, and l-valine, the formulation includes 215 milligrams of sodium and 205 milligrams of potassium alongside a proprietary hydration and antioxidant blend made with coconut water powder and pomegranate berry extract. We also like that the formulation includes an essential amino acid (EAA) blend, as well as a nitric oxide booster blend. “This NO booster blend is a unique touch, and I do feel it can help with improving my workout endurance over time,” notes our product tester, a certified personal trainer. Overall, the formulation earns 4 out of 5 stars. We do lower the rating, though, given that Snap Supplements BCAAs do feature multiple proprietary blends which doesn’t lend itself to concise dosages for listed ingredients. Available in two flavors (Pomegranate Watermelon and Peach Mango), Snap Supplements BCAAs aren’t exactly budget-friendly. If you order through the company’s website, a 30-serving container costs about $33, putting the price-per-serving at just over $1. However, you can save 15% by signing up for a subscription that will deliver this product to your door every month, every two months, or every three months. Compared to other BCAAs on this list, it’s definitely more expensive, leading to a price score of just 2.5 out of 5. Other, more budget-friendly BCAAs include Nutricost BCAAs and Cellucor Alpha Amino, among others. Lastly, Snap Supplements BCAAs aren’t third-party tested, so we do have some questions regarding the label accuracy, especially when considering the inclusion of proprietary blends. Accordingly, we rate this powder at 1 out of 5 for the category. Good for: Athletes wanting some added hydration benefits with their BCAAs of choice. Not good for: Users looking for a high variety of flavor options. If you’re looking for a BCAA supplement with minimal ingredients and a super simple formulation, Jacked Factory’s BCAA powder is it. It contains BCAAs and nothing more. This unflavored BCAA product is truly undetectable, though you can also choose from a few flavor options, as well, depending on current stocks. Our tester, a certified personal trainer, tried the Blue Raspberry flavor and was sold. “It’s a pleasant mixture of sweet and tart that isn’t too strong,” he says, giving flavor a perfect 5 out of 5 score. “This supplement dissolved super easily,” according to our tester, a certified nutrition coach, who gave the solubility a 5 out of 5. “There was no grittiness and I didn’t see much clumping. Though, it did settle a bit because I didn’t have my best shaker bottle readily available for trials.” After thoroughly evaluating the ingredients, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN gave Jacked Factory a 5 out of 5 for formulation. “There are no unnecessary ingredients, and the ratio of l-leucine to l-isoleucine to l-valine is backed by science,” she said. ( 18 ) Our testers didn’t experience any adverse side-effects, either, which is a major plus. However, we do wish this product were third-party tested. After digging through Jacked Factory’s website, it doesn’t appear the brand’s BCAA powder has undergone any testing from a lab or third party for quality and safety. For that extra seal of approval, we recommend sticking to a BCAA supplement like Momentous Vital Aminos or Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine. Our team loved the price point for this product, too. One 30-serving container is affordable, at a price of $19.99 (which is about $0.66 per serving), earning a 5 out of 5 for price per serving. Additionally, you can subscribe to recurring shipments and get 15% off and free shipping. Good for: Those wanting an unflavored BCAA powder to add to other supplements and blends already featuring a tasteful makeup. Not good for: Those looking for hydration support in their BCAA supplement. To be clear, men and women don’t have different needs when it comes to BCAAs. If paired with a healthy diet, BCAAs may be great dietary supplement additions to any athlete’s existing regimen for their potential to minimize fatigue and help maintain lean muscle mass. ( 17 ) For women, they could provide some potential benefits during menopause and post-menopause, as well. But for adults who want a budget-friendly BCAA supplement with multiple flavor options, we recommend you give Promix Nutrition BCAAs a shot. Our team gave the flavor a 5 out of 5 rating. You can choose from five different options (more than most other products) and there’s even an Unflavored pick for those who prefer to mix their BCAAs with other products like the best greens powders , creatine, protein powders, and more. Having used Promix BCAAs in the past, I do believe the taste is on-point, and the solubility is effective enough that it doesn’t throw off my day. However, the bagged nature of the packaging can lead to some unwanted spills across my countertops, more so than I’ve experienced with tubbed powders and capsules. I rate the convenience at 4 out of 5, accordingly, and suggest sticking with a tub of BCAAs like Nutricost BCAAs or Jacked Factory BCAAs if clean-up is a less-than-favorable step in your blending process. We’re big fans of Promix’s formulation, too, giving it a 4 out of 5 rating. We like the vegan-friendly, natural ingredients list — there are zero artificial sweeteners or colorings here. However, other formulas do include some additional micronutrients. Here, you do get 100% of your daily vitamin C, although this is the lone vitamin listed across the supplement facts. When it comes to cost, we’re pretty happy with the budget-friendly price point. This product costs $32, which is only about $1.07 per serving. However, you can subscribe to recurring purchases every 30 days and save 10%. Good for: Women looking for a simple BCAA supplement with enjoyable flavors and an approachable price tag. Not good for: Those looking for a wide range of nutrients in their BCAA supplement. There are many upsides to taking your BCAAs in pill form. Like the best creatine gummies , they’re easy to take with you to the gym or on the road, which is convenient if you’re going for extended periods between meals. For a no-fuss BCAA capsule, Crazy Muscle’s BCAA Pills are our top choice. This supplement features 1 gram of BCAAs per pill (3 grams per serving) in the ideal 2:1:1 ratio of l-leucine to l-isoleucine to l-valine. ( 18 ) However, these contain less BCAAs than most other BCAA supplements. “Compared to other supplements on the market, Crazy Muscle’s BCAA pills provide fewer grams of BCAAs per serving,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gave the formulation a 3.5 out of 5. “Plus, there are no added ingredients for additional performance perks like caffeine for energy or electrolytes for hydration .” Since pills don’t require any mixing, we rated convenience a 4 out of 5. However, you do need to take three per serving, which can be tedious, according to our testers. “These are pretty large pills — they are about the size of a quarter and are thick,” one of our testers says, giving the swallow-ability a 3 out of 5. “One serving is three pills and I had to take them separately, which I don’t love. They also leave white chalkiness on my hands.” Athletes who have a hard time swallowing pills may want to try something else. If you’d prefer a powdered BCAA supplement, we recommend the likes of Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine and Momentous Vital Aminos, among others. These are a budget-friendly pick, though. One 80-serving bottle costs $19.80, which is only about $0.25 per serving. Most other BCAA supplements are at least $1 per serving, earning this one a 5 out of 5 for cost. We also appreciate that they’re available on Amazon Prime. However, third-party testing gets a 1 out of 5, since there are no certifying lab results to speak of with this BCAA capsule. Good for: People that prefer to supplement their BCAAs in a pill or capsule format. Not good for: Those looking for a powder format. BCAA supplements aren’t necessarily gender-specific, but if you want a supplement with BCAAs that can support you through a workout, Transparent Labs Intra could be a good fit. Our tester, a triathlete and a certified sports nutrition coach, used Intra on multiple occasions. “ While I can’t say this enhanced my performance specifically, I can say that the inclusion of electrolytes and essential amino acids is exactly what I look for in a workout supplement,” they said. Offering the ideal 2:1:1 ratio of BCAAs, this intra-workout supplement is ideal for those wanting amino acids along with other ingredients that are proven to reduce muscle fatigue, improve endurance, support muscle growth, and promote endurance. ( 17 )( 18 ) “TL Intra gets a 4.25 out of 5,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “It is packed with powerful ingredients, but some compounds are patented and don’t share the breakdown of ingredients included.” She also likes that the formula contains all nine essential amino acids. Essential amino acids are those that the body doesn’t make on its own, so we have to consume them through food or supplements. ( 19 ) There are two flavors of Intra: Strawberry Lemonade and Blue Raspberry. Our tester awarded Blue Raspberry a 4 out of 5 for taste, stating that it’s almost too sweet. “ I recommend mixing it with more water than the instructions indicate,” she adds. “ When I did that, the flavor wasn’t quite so strong, and I enjoyed it more.” Furthermore, our tester also noted that the solubility is alright, as long as you shake before drinking. If you don’t shake between sips, the powder tends to settle toward the bottom. We rate the Intra at 3 out of 5 for the category and recommend powders like Nutricost BCAA or Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine for better blending protocols. Intra costs around $1.50 per serving, which earns it a 3-out-of-5 rating from our testers. That said, though, you can utilize Transparent Labs discount codes for better deals or use the brand’s ‘Subscribe & Save’ service for lower purchase totals and free shipping on repeat orders. Good for: Athletes wanting a quality intra-workout supplement to help bolster endurance and sustain hydration levels. Not good for: Those looking for an unflavored option. If you’re focused on muscle growth, it’s crucial to eat enough calories and protein throughout the day. When it comes to supplements like the best creatine supplements and BCAAs, you might want something that supports athletic performance and offers quality ingredients. Momentous Vital Aminos contains a scientifically-backed dosage of all nine essential amino acids, which are key for building, maintaining, and repairing lean muscle mass. ( 19 ) “This product is great for me since I primarily eat a vegetarian diet and I’m trying to keep my body in top shape for volleyball and climbing,” says our tester, certified personal trainer Rosie Borchert. As an additional benefit, Momentous Vital Aminos include l-tyrosine, which has been shown to improve cognitive flexibility and enhance your ability to switch between tasks without losing focus. ( 1 ) BCAAs are known to support muscle recovery, but they can also help increase muscle growth. The BCAA leucine, for example, is key for building muscle as it stimulates muscle protein synthesis. ( 4 )( 17 ) What’s more, there’s an added dose of calcium, potassium, and sodium to help maintain hydration. However, the ingredient doses are lacking. “This formula gets a 2.5 out of 5 in my book,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says. “The lack of research gives me pause, and to top it off, the amount of each ingredient really leaves you wanting more. Adding small portions of a few specific foods can give you more than you get in this formulation — and at a lower cost.” This product only comes in Tropical Punch. However, our tester really likes the taste, giving the flavor a 5 out of 5 rating. “Mixed with a glass of water, the flavor is really light and refreshing,” says Borchert. For flavor hounds, though, it may be best to opt for the likes of Nutricost BCAAs or 1st Phorm BCAAs for a larger variety of available tastes. A 30-serving bag of Momentous Vital Aminos costs around $45.95, which is about $1.53 per serving. Unfortunately, this is one of the most expensive products on our list, earning a 3 out of 5 for cost. Good for: People focused on building muscle that want to supplement with BCAAs. Not good for: Those looking for a wide range of flavor options. Any dietary supplement you plan to drink daily should taste refreshing — why do you think we’ve previously rated the best tasting protein powders ? Where flavor is concerned, we recommend Cellucor Alpha Amino as the best tasting BCAA supplement.. Alpha Amino is available in Watermelon, Icy Blue Razz, and Fruit Punch flavors. Our tester tried the Fruit Punch flavor, rating it a 4 out of 5 for taste. “It reminds me of Kool-Aid. It’s very sweet, maybe too sweet for my liking,” they say. However, Nick English, BarBend writer, disagrees. He says the taste is “refreshing” in his full review of this product. “I recommend using one scoop in 1.5 cups of water for the best taste,” he adds. Cellucor Alpha Amino packs 5 grams of BCAAs in the desired 2:1:1 ratio of leucine to isoleucine to valine. It also contains electrolytes like sodium, potassium, and magnesium to support hydration and muscle function. There are three proprietary blends in Alpha Amino, including the Hydration Blend. Inside that blend you’ll find betaine, which has been shown to help maintain cellular hydration. The blend also features coconut water powder, which contains five electrolytes (magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium, and phosphorus). While the included ingredients may be beneficial, if you prefer an all-natural formulation (like Naked Nutrition Naked BCAAs), this product might not be the best fit. Alpha Amino contains artificial ingredients including sucralose and red food dye. We also don’t love that this product contains proprietary blends and isn’t third-party tested. “I rate the formulation at 4 out of 5, though, since there are so many potential performance benefits if the proprietary blends are portioned correctly,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. “I used a shaker cup to mix it up and the texture felt very smooth,” says our tester, who gave solubility a 4.5 out of 5. “There was a little powder that would settle to the bottom, but with a little shake, it would mix right back in.” Alpha Amino’s cost is less than $1 per serving. The brand does offer a ‘Subscribe & Save’ service, though, with discounted totals depending on your repeat order frequency. Good for: Individuals valuing taste as a premium factor in their BCAA supplement selection. Not good for: Those looking to avoid artificial flavors and sweeteners. Read our full Cellucor Alpha Amino Review . Navigating a vegan diet for athletes can be difficult at times when trying to gather certain supplements. For those interested in BCAAs, we recommend Naked Nutrition Naked BCAAs. Not only is it Certified Vegan, but it’s also gluten-free, non-GMO, and free of any artificial sweeteners, colors, and fillers. Our tester, a certified health coach, said that this unflavored powder isn’t completely unflavored. “ If it’s mixed with water, you’ll notice a slightly bitter taste,” she said, giving it a 4 out of 5 on taste. “ I preferred mixing it into my smoothie.” You can purchase Cherry Lime or Strawberry Lemonade varieties, but the cost is higher given that these flavored options are only available in 34-serving containers. For reference, Unflavored Naked BCAAs are sold in 100-serving containers with costs per serving starting at $0.35. For less variability between order sizes, you can check out Nutricost BCAAs or 1st Phorm BCAAs. We prioritize BCAAs that come in that recommended 2:1:1 ratio, and Naked Nutrition does just that with this supplement. That breakdown is 2.5 grams of l-leucine, 1.25 grams of l-isoleucine, and 1.25 grams of l-valine. ( 18 ) “Naked Nutrition BCAAs get a 4.75 out of 5 for its simple formulation,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “You get a science-backed dose of BCAAs without unnecessary fluff.” While our tester isn’t sure if they felt any effects from this product — “I might have been a little less sore after some cardio days than I normally am,” they say — this budget cost makes it an easier investment to try out the waters for yourself. You can even subscribe and save another 10%. Given the budget-friendly cost, we gave this one an easy 5 out of 5 in the price category. Good for: Plant-based athletes wanting a Certified Vegan BCAA supplement. Not good for: Those looking for a flavored option. Whether you’re a rookie marathoner or a professional triathlete, a BCAAs supplement with added electrolytes can be ideal to support endurance exercise. ( 20 ) 1st Phorm BCAAs is packed with amino acids, electrolytes, and vitamins proven to benefit athletes. Our tester, Kate Meier, is an experienced marathoner who used 1st Phorm BCAAs following several runs. “ I didn’t experience any negative side effects ,” she says. “ I drank these during my post-run stretching sessions, and I felt great afterward.” 1st Phorm offers 7.5 grams of BCAAs in this product, alongside proprietary blends that contain aminos and electrolytes. Electrolytes like sodium and potassium may ease the effects of post-workout soreness, which is common amongst endurance athletes, yet more research is needed to illustrate this potential benefit. ( 21 ) “1st Phorm BCAAs score a 4 out of 5 for formulation with deductions for the proprietary blends,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “Additionally, the BCAA ratio falls just short of that 2:1:1 ratio for leucine , isoleucine , and valine .” If you’re looking for that ideal metric, we recommend looking at Cellucor Alpha Amino or Crazy Muscle BCAA Pills, among others included in this round-up. Meier tried the Blue Raspberry flavor (one of six available options) and gave it a perfect 5 out of 5 rating. “ I would compare this to blue Kool-Aid,” she says. Another reason we like this for athletes is because it is third-party tested. We feel we can trust that what’s on the label is what’s in the container. At around $1.12 per serving, 1st Phorm BCAAs falls in the middle of the road when it comes to pricing — we rate it at a modest 3 out of 5. There is a subscription option, but unlike most other brands, you don’t actually save money if you subscribe. Still, though, if your workout routine is loaded with plenty of muscular endurance exercises , this powder may be worth your consideration. Good for: Endurance athletes wanting to support their training with a flavorfulBCAA powder. Not good for: Those looking to avoid artificial sweeteners. One of the most established benefits of BCAA supplements is their ability to support efficient muscle recovery. ( 4 )( 17 )( 19 ) If you’re looking to make this a priority within your regimen, we recommend Essential BCAA 2:1:1 Powder from MyProtein. This formulation packs in 4 grams of branched-chain amino acids per three-scoop serving in an ideal 2:1:1 ratio for muscle protein synthesis and easier recuperation post-training. As a certified nutrition coach, I appreciate the clear supplement facts on the back of the packaging — you can quickly digest what’s included in the makeup. However, I rate the formulation at 3.75 out of 5 given the presence of sucralose in a majority of the flavored options. “Sucralose can cause GI distress in some athletes, so it may be best to steer clear,” notes Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, registered dietitian nutritionist and BarBend expert reviewer. More natural, synthetic-free options include Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine and Momentous Vital Aminos. As far as taste is concerned, we score MyProtein Essential BCAA at 4 out of 5 given the range of flavor options available, including an Unflavored pick that can be added to pre-workout or even some of the best post-workout supplements without altering the flavor profile excessively. I’ve previously had the Peach Rings option, too, and do admire the accuracy of the flavor titles — it tastes like one of my favorite gummy treats. While some may find this BCAA powder to be excessively sweet given the sucralose content, I do feel that many would enjoy the makeup, overall. MyProtein Essential BCAA is available in multiple container sizes with costs starting at roughly $0.73 per serving. I always try to seek out supplements available in multiple tub (in this case, bag) sizes, as it opens the door for bulk orders at a lower price point. As such, we rate the value at 4 out of 5. A word of caution, though — bagged containers, while efficient and space-saving, can lead to some mess when digging out your servings. Good for: Individuals with dedicated recovery regimens for improved muscle retention and fewer bouts of muscle soreness. Not good for: Those looking for a vegan option. Athletes can take BCAAs before, during, or after training to help bolster muscle protein synthesis. If you fall in the crowd of pre-training consumers, it can be wise to mix your BCAA supps with a prominent pre-workout to reap the energetic, endurance-laden perks of both dietary supplements. In our opinion, BCAA Lean Energy from EVLution Nutrition serves as a high-quality blend designed to help provide plenty of sparks to carry your energy and recovery levels to new heights. In addition to the 5 grams of BCAAs, BCAA Lean Energy features 110 milligrams of a “Natural Energizers” blend which includes natural caffeine from coffee beans and green tea extract. Kate Meier, BarBend editorial team member and certified personal trainer, notes that the caffeine hit is a nice touch that can definitely give you a pleasant boost for training. “I equate this to my morning cup of coffee. It’s not overpowering where I feel scatter-brained, but still provides a much-appreciated jolt.” The “Natural Energizers” blend is, however, a proprietary blend, meaning there’s some questions surrounding actual dosages of included ingredients. For that reason we gave the formulation a 4 out of 5. For those who want full transparency across their BCAA’s supplement facts, consider Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine or Momentous Vital Aminos. Of course, caffeine-tolerant individuals may need a bit more of a kick. For these needs, we recommend pairing a standalone BCAA powder to some of the strongest pre-workouts we’ve tested. Be mindful, though, that the recommended daily allowance for caffeine is up to 400 milligrams — you should avoid consuming more than this metric between all your consumed beverages. ( 24 ) We score this EVLution Nutrition offering at 5 out of 5 for side effects, too, given Meier’s reported experience with the powder. “I didn’t have any unwanted distress, and the energy seemed to burn efficiently throughout my entire training session,” she adds. “This powder earns a 5 out of 5, too in solubility — no issues pre-consumption or post-consumption!” BCAA Lean Energy is available in 30-serving containers across four available flavors. Per our math, costs per serving begin at roughly $0.83, depending on your chosen taste, placing it around the average of other BCAA powders. Overall, we rate the value at 4 out of 5. Naturally, though, the value does drop if you’re less enthusiastic about a caffeine-enriched BCAA supplement. Good for: People that tend to mix their BCAA supplements with pre-workout — this all-in-one powder has already done the blending. Not good for: Those looking to avoid caffeine. The BarBend team is composed of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, nutrition coaches, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. To determine the best BCAA supplements available today, we tested 26 different products from high-quality brands, using our supplement testing methodology as guidance in rating each silhouette in a range of categories. Ratings were scored on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) in categories such as the following: BCAAs are the building blocks of protein, and when you consume complete protein sources like chicken, beef, fish, or whey protein powder, you are consuming BCAAs. If your diet is rich in high-quality protein sources, chances are you’re already getting the benefits of BCAAs . BCAA supplements aren’t a must-have but they may support muscle growth and improve athletic performance. Here are a few benefits you may see with consistent BCAA use: Studies report that regular BCAA consumption has shown to cause no adverse effects. ( 23 ) However, taking BCAAs featuring other ingredients like artificial sweeteners or known allergens can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, and other unwanted symptoms. For BCAAs containing caffeine and other stimulants, Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD states, “Athletes with known sensitivities to the effects of caffeine may experience side effects such as anxiety, insomnia, or headaches, even with lower doses below the FDA’s 400-milligram daily recommendation.” ( 24 ) There’s also concerns over BCAAs and their relationship to insulin resistance. “ The relationship between BCAAs and insulin resistance is complex, as BCAAs cause the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscles to have different metabolic responses ,” says Dr. Jennie Sanford, MD. “ BCAAs do not cause systemic insulin resistance, but when they are metabolized poorly, this can be a sign of underlying insulin resistance that needs to be addressed .” As with every supplement — from the best multivitamins to proteins, pre-workouts, and beyond — it’s always advisable to take your personal sensitivities into question prior to purchase. You can also speak to your personal healthcare provider if you’re looking for more detailed information on which ingredients and dosages align with your personal needs and wants. “ For people who regularly eat animal proteins, your diet probably includes sufficient amounts of BCAAs ,” notes Dr. Jennie Stanford, MD. “ However, amino acids are needed for a number of physiologic functions, and when you don’t have enough circulating amino acids, your body will break down muscle tissue to release them. So, for extended periods without consuming protein or even working out in a fasting state, BCAAs can help maintain lean muscle mass .” Before purchasing a BCAA supplement, you may want to consider a few important factors. As BCAA supplements can vary substantially, you’ll want to consider ingredients, dosages, formulation, price, and the necessity of BCAAs before making a decision. We detail each of these more below. The ingredient lists on BCAA supplements can vary drastically from one supplement to another. You’ll want to consider what you’re looking for in a BCAA supplement and what you hope the outcome of taking one will be. If you’re looking strictly for BCAAs, you may want to opt for a simple formulation with a minimalist ingredient list. If you’re looking for BCAAs to be a part of your supplement regimen, but not the entirety of it, you may want to choose one with a solid dose of BCAAs as well as other ingredients, like glutamine, citrulline, or electrolytes. For those looking to combine BCAAs with electrolytes, Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD has an important note to consider. “It’s important to remember that sodium is the most abundant electrolyte lost in sweat, so if you’re looking for a supplement with added electrolytes to fuel your extensive training in intense conditions, be sure to confirm that sodium replenishment is feasibly achievable with the formulation of choice.” You’ll also want to consider how many grams of BCAAs each product offers.The recommended breakdown for BCAAs is a 2:1:1 ratio of leucine to isoleucine to valine for best potential effect. ( 18 ) Many supplements on the market have 4 grams in total of BCAAs, but you will find some supplements on this list that contain up to 8 grams as well. Some prefer to opt for a higher amount of BCAAs for effectiveness or potential recovery benefits. Are you looking for straight BCAAs or do you want something more robust? More complex formulations will often include BCAAs with several other ingredients that offer exercise enhancing benefits. BCAAs are also commonly found in pre-workout supplements and are naturally occurring in the best protein powders . Some people prefer to take straight BCAAs as an additional supplement in their stack.Others prefer to include them wrapped up in another supplement, which can cut down on the number of supplements they’re taking. You’ll also want to consider whether you want a flavored powder, unflavored powder, or a pill formulation. Some people enjoy the taste of sweet, tangy, or fruity supplements, while others prefer pills for a convenient on-the-go supplement for the gym or while traveling. There is no wrong answer, just the answer that best suits your lifestyle. Many supplements can be really helpful additions to your supplement lineup and may help you achieve your goals more efficiently, but they shouldn’t empty your bank account. Your budget will be a major consideration when you’re picking out your perfect BCAA supplement. That’s why we provided options for every budget. You should prioritize brands that are fully transparent about the ingredients in their supplements. The most reputable brands will typically run third-party testing to show that their products are safe and effective. Essentially, the third-party is an independent, external organization that evaluates a product’s makeup to ensure that what’s on the label is what’s in the product. Some organizations that you might see perform third-party testing include NSF, Informed Choice, Informed Sport, Banned Substance Control Group, and more. In the simplest of terms, amino acids are molecules that form proteins within the body. In total, there are 20 amino acids, and nine of which are labeled as “essential” meaning the body cannot produce them internally, so they must be consumed through the diet. Debating between BCAAs versus EAAs comes down to the molecular structure of the amino acids themselves, since BCAAs are EAAs, in theory. The distinguishing factor, as the name suggests, is the branched-chain structure of the molecules that make up leucine, isoleucine, and valine — the three BCAAs. The remaining EAAs include histidine, methionine, threonine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. We know that supplement labels can involve a lot of jargon and be tough to understand for the average person. Let’s break down what you’re most likely to see on your ingredients label, starting with the three branched-chain amino acids. It stands for branched-chain amino acid. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and the branched chain amino acids are those most closely associated with muscle protein synthesis, the process by which protein is produced to repair and retain muscle. Probably not, so long as you’re eating plenty of protein and calories throughout your day. If that’s the case, taking extra BCAAs around a workout probably won’t serve much extra benefit. Where BCAAs appear to have the most use is when the athlete is exercising on an empty stomach, isn’t eating much quality protein with a meal, or wants to retain their muscle during a fast or during a long period without protein. If you fall into those categories, BCAAs may be useful. While there are a wide variety of BCAA supplements that are great, our favorite is Transparent Labs BCAA Glutamine. It contains 8,000mg of BCAAs and we like the addition of vitamin C. It’s best to take BCAAs before or during your workout, depending on which kind you are using. A few BCAA supplements will say that you can take them before, during, or after a workout, but as far as basic BCAA supplements go, they’re probably most effective if you take them pre-workout. ( 2 ) For anyone who’s going hard at the gym, intra-workout BCAAs may be helpful in warding off fatigue. ( 3 ) BCAAs can help support muscles growth and improve athletic performance. They can also help prevent muscle fatigue while training, which can indirectly help you build muscle. However, if you’re eating plenty of protein and calories, taking BCAA supplements around a workout probably won’t have much benefit. EAA stands for Essential Amino Acids, which are comprised of the nine amino acids essential to humans: phenylalanine, valine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, leucine, isoleucine, lysine, and histidine. BCAAs (Branched-Chain Amino Acids) are made up of leucine, isoleucine and valine, Essential Amino Acids that are grouped together because they have a slightly different chemical structure than the others. Essentially, BCAA supplements focus on these three amino acids, but can contain others. Perry Nix, the owner of The Free RD, is a registered dietitian and freelance nutrition writer.

    "text": "The world of nutrition is awash in different diets , and it’s safe to say that many of them hinge on rules surrounding what you can and can’t eat: nothing post-caveman for the Paleo diet , nothing from an animal for vegans, no fruit or grains on slow carb, and so on. This is why the “If It Fits Your Macros” diet, also known as IIFYM, is seen by many as revolutionary. This method of eating allows you to eat anything from any food group — so long as it fits your macros. You’ll gain or lose weight if you’re consuming the right amount of calories, and you’re more likely to gain muscle and lose fat if you’re eating the right balance of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. That’s IIFYM in a nutshell: keep your calories and macros in check, exercise appropriately, and your weight and body composition will improve. Want to make some buttery buffalo chicken? No sweat; watch your quantities. Does that coworker’s birthday cake tempt you? Have a slice; just deduct it from your daily calorie allotment. For many, tracking calories feels very restrictive. In contrast, for others, IIFYM is an unbelievable breath of fresh air after years of “clean food” diets consisting of chicken, broccoli, rice, and absolutely no pizza ever. If It Fits Your Macros is a diet that has the user track their macronutrients — protein, carbs, and fats — to ensure they’re consuming enough calories (in specific ratios) to lose, gain, or maintain weight . IIFYM promotes dietary freedom, which is a significant reason why it’s gained so much popularity among physique and strength athletes. As long as you hit your macronutrient target, you can, in theory, eat whatever you want. The idea is that 30 grams of carbs — whether from vegetables, cereal, or pizza — is 30 grams. IIFYM works by keeping people in a calorie range that suits their goals and then using this calorie target to distinguish the amount each macronutrient contributes to these calories. The success of IIFYM is predicated on the idea that weight loss is primarily a matter of energy in versus energy out. If you burn more calories than you consume, you’ll lose weight. And if you eat more fuel than your body uses, you’ll gain weight . “At the end of the day, whether you gain or lose weight comes down to calorie balance, and the macronutrients you use to comprise your total daily calories can exert a significant effect on what kind of weight you gain or lose,” says New York-based registered dietitian Leyla Shamayeva, MS, RD . “Speaking broadly, athletes typically want to gain as much muscle as they can when they’re trying to bulk, and they want to lose as little muscle as possible when they’re trying to cut.” Based on this idea, calorie-counting is enough to either lose or gain weight. By counting your macros, however, you’re able to more precisely give your body the nutrients and macros it needs to build muscle or lose fat while maintaining muscle. Say you eat 2,000 calories worth of Doritos and Swedish Fish all day — you’ll lose weight on paper, but your body won’t have the materials necessary to carve out the physique you want. Tracking your food intake is vital to long-term dietary success because even if you are not counting calories, the calories you eat will still affect your weight over time. ( 1 ) Ignoring your bank account doesn’t mean you don’t have money issues, and not paying mind to your food intake doesn’t mean calories don’t count. The seed of the current wave of the IIFYM diet, it’s fair to say, was planted by Mark Haub, a professor of nutrition at Kansas State University. Haub is the man who is best known for his famous “ Twinkie diet .” He ate a Twinkie every three hours for two months, along with corn chips, Oreos, and other processed snacks. He also consumed a protein shake and a multivitamin every day, practices that didn’t make quite as many headlines. The results? After two months of Twinkies every day, Haub lost 27 pounds and improved his cholesterol and triglyceride levels to boot. How can he have improved his body mass and his heart health on such a junk diet? Because as much as we want to believe a trim waistline will just come from eliminating candy or dairy or red meat or anything else, the fact is that for almost everyone, the only thing that matters for weight loss is calorie balance. (This assumes you don’t have hormonal problems or other rare disorders that can interfere with normal metabolism .) After two months of Twinkies every day, Haub lost 27 pounds and improved his cholesterol and triglyceride levels to boot. Haub ate about 1,800 calories a day, and his daily calories needed to maintain his weight was 2,600. He, therefore, lost weight, and that’s good for your health and your heart. That’s all there is to it. The experiment received considerable media attention and renewed enthusiasm for flexible dieting . Later, entrepreneur and fitness enthusiast Anthony Collova became well known for further popularizing the trend, launching a detailed macronutrient calculator at IIFYM.com to help curious dieters start their own experiments. People were successfully manipulating their body composition while making room for their favorite foods. There are three main macronutrients — protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Alcohol (aka ethanol) is technically the fourth macronutrient . Each macro plays a specific role in how your body functions and each macro contains a particular number of calories per gram: The three main macros combined will make up your total caloric allotment. Once you know how many calories you need to eat to reach your goals, you’ll divide up a specific amount of calories to each macro. There’s no one-size-fits-all ratio. Bodybuilders typically follow a 40-40-20 percentage split of protein, carbs, and fat. If you follow a keto diet , your ratio may look like 30-5-65. Athletes who require a lot of workout fuel in carbohydrates may eat a split that looks like 30-50-20. Below, you’ll find a brief primer on protein, carbs, fats, and how all three impact your training goals. Protein supports muscle retention and muscle growth, which is crucial because it allows you to continue burning calories at a rate that encourages weight loss. Eating more protein helps you to look your best and can aid in muscle recovery . It’s also a satiating macronutrient, meaning you get a lot of volume per calorie basis. Protein is essential to consume before and after workouts to encourage muscle repair and growth. Still, research also suggests that protein can be consumed throughout the day rather than having it all at once to maximize the amino acids that protein provides. ( 2 ) When setting up your macro targets, you should aim for a protein intake of 0.7-1 grams per pound of body weight, depending on how active you are. If you’re not very active, you can stick to the lower end of the range, but if you’re highly functional, you should use the higher end of the spectrum. [Read More: The Best Tasting Protein Powders , We Tasted Them All so You Don’t Have To] Carbs are the most efficient nutrient for supplying the body with the energy it needs to maintain organ function. ( 3 ) Carbs are also extremely important while exercising because they are the body’s preferred fuel source and therefore provide the energy you need to perform your best in training and recover after training. ( 4 ) When your weight-related progress comes to a halt, you will typically add or subtract from your carbohydrate intake first. Carbs are adjusted before protein and fats because they are usually overconsumed by most people, especially those who are not tracking their macros or are not nutrient-conscious. Carbs are also not as satisfying as protein and fats and, therefore, you can usually reduce them without getting too hungry. The amount of carbs you should consume per day is usually determined based on the number of calories that are remaining from your daily calorie target after you’ve set your protein and fat targets. [Read More: The Best Mass Gainers , Tested by Experts and RD Approved] Fats are essential for your health because they are required for some micronutrients to be absorbed (vitamins A, D, E, K). They can be anti-inflammatory and help regulate your hormones. ( 5 ) Therefore, at least 20% of total daily calories should be allocated to fats. You can eat more fat if you prefer, but you will have to adjust your carbohydrate intake. If you’re more active, you’ll want to have a higher percentage of carbohydrates than fat. If you’re not as active, you’re probably okay with a higher fat to carb ratio. Fats are the macronutrients with the highest number of calories per gram, but they are also the slowest to digest, so they will keep you full for longer periods. Therefore, eating a higher ratio of fat to carbs could help prevent you from getting too hungry throughout the day, which could help improve your adherence to your macronutrient targets. Don’t worry if you’ve never weighed a gram of food in your life. Here’s a quick rundown of how to track your macros successfully. First, you need to figure how many calories you should be eating per day. It’s not a perfect science, but multiply your body weight by 11 if you’re looking to lose weight or by 15 if you’re looking to gain weight. From there, you can follow these general guidelines to calculate your macros: If math isn’t your strong suit, then you can refer to this macro calculator below to get a good starting macro set: Once you’ve determined your macronutrient targets, you can begin tracking them manually or in an app. MyFitnessPal is a popular tracking app with an extensive food database and is compatible with different fitness trackers . Another option is Chronometer, which isn’t as compatible with other devices but does offer accurate food entries. Next, you’ll need a food scale so you can weigh out all of your cooked and dry ingredients. (As a bonus: a food scale is beneficial to have in a kitchen even if you’re not into fitness and dieting.) Eyeballing portion sizes without practice is difficult. What you think is four ounces of chicken may be seven — that’s a 100-calorie difference, which, over time, can derail your weight loss efforts. A food scale will ensure proper intake, whether you’re batch cooking or whipping up a single meal. You’ll also want to snag a bodyweight scale and a measuring tape. It may sound obsessive, but tracking your body weight lets you know if your macros are optimal. For example, if you’re losing more than a pound a week, your macros are probably too low. Weighing yourself a few times per week also allows you to identify trends in your weight loss journey — like how much your weight fluctuates after a cheat meal and how quickly it takes to level back out. The measuring tape is necessary because the number on your scale isn’t the only barometer of success. It’s not unusual for a person to lose only a few pounds over a few months but for them to lose a few inches off of their waist — which is a sign you’ve lost fat but maintain some muscle mass . Apologies in advance, because if you’re jumping for joy at the idea of eating whatever you want while losing weight, prepare to take a seat. “If you’re going to track macros because you like the freedom of choices, it’s important to realize that you should still choose healthy foods ,” says New York-based registered dietitian Natalie Rizzo, MS, RD. “For example, you get a lot more pieces of fruit than candy within the carb allotment.” Say your macros are 200 grams of protein, 250 grams of carbs, and 60 grams of fat. A slice of cheese pizza contains roughly 30 grams of carbs, 12-15 grams of fat, and 8-10 grams of protein. Those macros aren’t bad for “junk food,” but they’re not entirely balanced either. Eat two slices of za and half of your fat is gone for the day. Common “junk foods” are high in calories from carbs and fats, and so eating them takes up a large amount of your daily caloric allotment while providing little to no protein and, frankly, not much satiation. The best way to ensure long-term macro success is to build your daily meal plan around “single-macro foods” or foods that contain primarily one macronutrient. By choosing single-macro foods, you’re able to mix better and match different foods to create larger and more filling protein-dense meals . For example, a Big Mac contains 540 calories and 30 grams of fat and 45 grams of carbs, and 25 grams of protein. Instead, you can make your own burger using 96% lean beef, low-fat or no-fat cheese, light mayonnaise, veggies, and a hamburger bun and slash the calories by 30% while keeping the protein the same. Single-macro foods typically refer to what most people associate with being healthy foods — chicken, lean beef, potatoes, rice, oatmeal, egg whites, green leafy vegetables, and more. Of course, you don’t need to eat single-macro foods all day every day, but eating more of them will probably make hitting your macro goals easier. Here are some food choices in each macro category that you can consider fitting into your eating plan: The best way to ensure you hit your macros day after day is to plan out your meals in advance. This way, you can pre-log your macros in your app of choice and not have to think about it. It helps to choose meals that you like to eat day after day. Every week or so, you can switch up your food choices so you don’t get bored. As long as the macro profiles stay consistent, your food sources can change. It also helps to try your best to plan out indulgences. If you know you’re going out to eat, leave room in your macros for a restaurant meal and maybe a drink. It helps to look up the restaurant’s menu ahead of time and pursue your options. Another tip for eating out: Always leave more room than you think in your macros. Oftentimes, restaurants cook with oils. So if you’re ordering a chicken dish, account for an extra 10 grams of fat or so. [Read More: Best Meal Replacement Shakes, With Dietician Advice] Although your primary concerns are staying within the calorie range and hitting the macronutrients targets, you should also be concerned about ensuring that the quality of food that you’re eating is sufficient. Higher quality foods contain micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) that the body needs to function optimally and that help to reduce the overall risk for disease and illness. ( 6 ) Foods that are highly processed contain little to no micronutrients. Micronutrients are nutrients that the body doesn’t produce itself, similar to macronutrients, but they’re called “micronutrients” because you need them in lesser quantities than carbs, fats, and protein. “Your macros are important for reaching these goals, but it’s important to not forget about the ‘micros,'” says Shamayeva. “The more extreme factions of the IIFYM movement love to fill their days with hundreds, if not thousands of calories of junk food that happen to fit their macros. A calorie-controlled diet can make room for treats, but if you go too far in one direction then you can easily find yourself missing out on nutrients that are also important for your goals.” [Read More: The Best BCAA Supplements , Expert Tested and Approved] However, just because you need micronutrients in smaller quantities doesn’t mean they aren’t important. If you’re not getting enough micros, you will likely feel sick, bloated, less energetic, and overall just feel worse than if you were to include them more regularly. That’s not to say that a person can’t have these less nutritious foods in their diet, but they should include them less frequently and in smaller quantities while prioritizing higher quality foods most of the time. A couple of ways that you could maintain this balance between more nutrient-dense foods and less nutritious foods is to pair them together. For example, if you want to have a donut, you could pair it with fruit to make it a more nutritious snack. Or if you didn’t want to pair anything with the donut, you could prioritize more nutrient-dense foods in all other meals/snacks for the day so that you’re still getting all the nutrients you need in a day while enjoying the donut. Also, taking extra supplements like a multivitamin and/or greens powder is a great way to help fill in the gaps in your diet. Tracking your macronutrients using an IIFYM approach is a valuable tool to ensure that you’re getting enough of each nutrient to achieve your goals, whether that be weight loss, weight gain, body recomposition , or improved performance. However, it’s important to understand what IIFYM is not, and that is an excuse to eat anything and everything just because you can . This diet is a tool that, when followed correctly, can teach followers moderation, the importance of food choice, and how to construct a meal plan that is doable for the long term. While any food is technically fair game with IIFYM, there are some meals that are near-impossible to fit responsibly into most macro plans. A basket of fish and chips or a restaurant-style chicken parmesan can get close to (if not sometimes above) 1,000 calories and over a day’s worth of fats. The point of IIFYM is to fit smaller indulgences into your day of eating while keeping your total calories on track. However, certain occasions will arise where that’s not feasible — and that’s ok. If you’re at a birthday party and want to eat a double cheeseburger with bacon, do it, but then get back on track for the next meal. The 80/20 approach to nutrition, where the goal is to eat nutrient-dense foods 80% of the time, and less nutrient-dense only 20% of the time, is a good guideline to follow on the IIFYM diet. If you want to get the most out of an IIFYM approach, then you need to be mindful of not only your macronutrient intake but also your micronutrient intake. If you feel like garbage but you’re hitting your macros, is it really going to feel worth it? The IIFYM diet is a reliable and time-tested tool that can help dieters achieve their goals with more freedom of choice. It still requires dedication, planning, and some sacrifice (any diet does), but for those looking to establish a healthier lifestyle — not just a short-term diet — IIFYM is for you .

Join BarBend tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC , and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, as they discuss some of the best protein powders for women, with a focus on how these supplements can support muscle gain, pregnancy, and organic diets. With 8 different flavors and 28 grams of whey protein from hormone-free, grass-fed cows, Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is an excellent way to hit your protein macros. Thanks to a wide range of tasty flavors, a clean, third-party tested makeup, and a solid dose of easy-digesting whey protein isolate, we think Transparent Labs 100% Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate is one of the best whey protein powders out there — for women, men, and nonbinary people alike. This supplement delivers 28 grams of whey protein isolate, a highly refined type of whey protein that’s filtered to remove the lactose and fat content. This can be great for athletes who have experienced digestive issues like bloating with other protein forms, such as concentrate. Our expert, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian nutritionist, also really likes this formula. “I love that Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is free from artificial sweeteners, food dyes, and preservatives, ” Bourgeois says. “ You get 28 grams of high-quality protein without any unnecessary fluff. Plus, it’s tested by a third-party lab, and the certificates of analysis are available right on the website.” Our tester agrees.  “ This is, without question, one of the best protein powders I’ve had in recent memory. You get the satiety you want from a mixed shake, there aren’t any negative side effects post-consumption, and the flavors are impeccable ,” they say. Of course, you’ll be paying for this leaner protein form to the tune of $2 per serving, which is why we rate this protein powder at 3.5 out of 5 in terms of cost. “I haven’t experienced any stomach or digestive issues after drinking it as I sometimes do with other whey protein powders,” adds our tester. “It mixes easily with milk or water, too, with a nice consistency and no clumps. Plus, it’s a filling protein shake that keeps me plenty full in-between my normal meals.” We also recommend Transparent Labs 100% Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate for women because of its calcium dosage of 114 milligrams. Studies indicate that keeping a diet with higher calcium counts may help qualm some troublesome PMS symptoms like cramps and food cravings. ( 1 ) While it’s not a complete answer to the recommended 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day, it can be a helping hand when added to a robust, well-rounded nutritional plan. ( 2 ) Also, BarBend worked with an accredited lab to gather testing data on the accuracy and purity of more than 150 protein powders, including Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate. It ranked among the top 25% for heavy metals and top 10% for bisphenols, phthalates, and pesticides.  Finally, it should be noted that Transparent Labs only offers this 100% Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate in 30-serving tubs. That can be enough for a month’s worth of daily shakes, but there’s no option to buy in bulk for a cheaper cost per serving. If you’re interested in a powder you can buy in bulk, we’d recommend protein options from Nutricost and Bulk Supplements. Read our full Transparent Labs Whey Protein Powder Review . Nutricost's Whey Protein Concentrate comes in five different flavors and packs 25 grams of protein per serving. This product is also available in two- and five-pound containers, making it easier to buy in bulk. Some protein powders can cost upwards of two dollars per serving (or more), which definitely isn’t the most budget-friendly price point. When it comes to cost, our team gave Nutricost’s Whey Protein Concentrate a 5 out of 5. At only $0.98 per serving, this is a more approachable price point, compared to other products, which are usually at least $1.50 per serve. “I’d score this formula a 3.5 out of 5, with high marks for its macro and BCAA ratios,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer. “It has room for improvement with the sweeteners used.” While we like the 25 grams of protein per serving, this product is sweetened with sucralose, which may not work with all athletes. If you’re looking for a protein supplement with no artificial ingredients, check out our list of the best organic protein powders , which includes offerings from Legion, Ritual, and several others. For flavor, though, our team gave this product a perfect 5 out of 5 rating. One of our testers tried the Chocolate Peanut Butter and absolutely loved the taste. “I generally am not the biggest peanut butter fan, actually,” they say. “But this one doesn’t overpower the chocolate, so I really enjoyed it.” This product also mixes extremely well in even just a shaker cup, earning a 5 out of 5 for solubility. Some formulas may require a blender or might leave clumps and sediment after mixing but that certainly wasn’t the case here. We also loved the creamy texture, which was a lot like melted ice cream. “ I like the price point, I like the taste, I love the protein content! ” adds Meier. One of the very few protein powders with no carbs or fat whatsoever, this product contains 25 grams of whey protein isolate and is great for anyone looking for a leaner protein option. When looking to hit your protein needs with a supplemental shake, it helps when the concoction actually tastes good, right? One of the best-tasting protein powders we’ve found in testing continues to be Xwerks Grow. Across the board, we’ve yet to find a flavor offering that lacks richness and consistency, so there’s little regret when opting for one taste over the next. Taste scores a 5 out of 5. “ I thought the chocolate flavor is just like Yoohoo chocolate milk drink! The flavor is perfect and just the right amount of sweetness ,” says our tester, who also scores the powder a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “I barely need a blender ball to make a shake with no clumps,” they add. “It’s a quasi-milkshake every time, regardless of whether I mix the powder with milk or water.” In terms of the formulation, we also appreciate how XWERKS offers between 25.8 and 27.8 grams of whey protein isolate in each serving while keeping calories down to just 110, along with 1 and 2 grams of carbohydrates, and between 0 and 2 grams of fat. It’s a well-rounded build that’s also a good value — similar whey protein isolate powders can easily cost over $2 per scoop. Our expert, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, agrees. “I like that Xwerks Grow is a lean protein powder, providing 25 grams of protein per scoop,” she says. “And you get 6 grams of BCAAs — another bonus.” While it may not have as robust of a flavor menu as other protein supplements out there, we can confidently say that Xwerks Grow is sure to please most taste buds. The brand plays the hits with classic flavors like Chocolate, Vanilla, and Peanut Butter, and they do it well. We only wish this protein powder was sold in larger containers — if you’re looking to buy in bulk, you may be displeased with the lone 30-serving container option. If you’re in the market for a bulk option, check out offerings from Nutricost or Bulk Supplements. Read our full Xwerks Grow Review . Dig into this easily digesting grass-fed whey isolate that provides 25 grams of protein with each lean 110 calorie scoop. It comes in three tasty flavors at a cost-effective price making it a solid choice for nearly anyone. If you’re creating fitness goals that involve adding some muscle mass to your physique, protein can be a worthwhile dietary supplement to add to your regimen. Studies show that in people who are training often, regular supplementation with protein powder can lead to increased muscle mass and in-training performance. ( 3 ) For our money, Jacked Factory’s Authentic ISO is prime for women wanting a boost in their progress. We appreciate how this protein powder uses whey protein isolate in its formulation, which can help alleviate any potential bloating or discomfort you may experience during consumption. Our expert, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, agrees. “I love its macro breakdown. Each scoop is packed with an impressive 25 grams of protein with minimal carbohydrate and fat content,” she notes. We give this a 3.5 out of 5 for side effects, though, because the makeup does contain stevia and sucralose. These sweetening agents have been shown to cause GI distress in some people, so make sure to take your body’s sensitivity into question before opting for this muscle-boosting shake. ( 4 ) That said, our tester, a certified personal trainer, experienced no adverse effects. “No bloating or stomach issues, and I didn’t feel overly full either,” they say. As far as taste is concerned, we appreciate the variety offered in this whey isolate . Our tester says, “I really enjoyed the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor. It had a good consistency when mixed with milk and adding a few ice cubes for a chilled smoothie made for quite the sweet treat.” Of course, though, not every athlete carries the same palate. We found that some customers noted less-than-desirable tastes with a few flavors. “Love the quality of the protein but this is so sweet that it can make me nauseous, ” says one customer in reference to the Vanilla Oatmeal Cookie flavor. “I literally have to find something bitter to eat afterward.” This Jacked Factory powder costs $1.33 per serving, which is about average compared to other protein powders we’ve tested. There are, however, no bulk options available. If that’s what you’re in search of, check out offerings from Bulk Supplements or Nutricost. Read our full Jacked Factory Authentic ISO Review . Gainful Plant-Based Protein Powder offers up to 24 grams of organic brown rice and pea protein, which delivers a complete amino acid profile. Right now, take 50% off your first order with the code: BF50. When you’re looking to lose weight, consuming a protein powder that packs a punch of protein, contains clean ingredients, and remains low in calories is ideal. Finding the best protein powder for weight loss out in the wild can be tough, especially since so many are jam-packed with added sugars, contain a paltry 10 to 15 grams of protein per serving, or ( gulp ) both. Enter Gainful Vegan Protein, which will give you a lean blend of purity, taste and amino acids. At 21 grams of protein per serving, this pea and brown rice protein blend certainly packs a punch. That is, if you can afford it. Gainful Vegan Protein runs up a hefty cost at up to $3.21 per serving, making it more than double the cost of other options we’ve tested. Still, it’ll run you less than most cups of coffee nowadays, and the flavor boosts offer you that option (i.e., Caffe Mocha), which one of our testers was especially eager to try. It was sweet enough, they report, saying, “I only needed the one flavor packet to get the sweetness.” But it certainly wasn’t protein coffee. “But still, it wasn’t the most ‘coffee’ of coffee-themed things I’ve ever had.” They rate the taste 3.5 out of 5. The solubility was a bit better, ranking a 4 out of 5 from our tester; but, they did note that the powder itself was pretty thick and has a tendency to travel. “I wound up wearing some protein on my clothes,” they say Part of the mess was in the journey of finding the scoop. “I had to dig around to locate and excavate the scoop,” our tester notes. It dissolved well when they did get to mix it, though. Our expert, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, had a different reason she loved this product and we have to agree. “I really like that Gainful has registered dietitians available to their subscribing customers, especially since they provide their buyers with personalized formulas,” she says. “Goals change over time, as do nutrition needs, so it’s great that there’s support in place when customers have questions about switching formulas.” Overall, if you’re looking to shed a couple pounds, Gainful has a solid amount of protein, minimal calories, clean ingredients, and an abundance of flavors to choose from. But if you’d rather skip the cost and all the single-use plastic from the flavors “boosters,” there are certainly other options out there. It’s important to remember that vegan protein powders are not the only proteins that may help with weight loss. Whey proteins from brands like Transparent Labs and Legion have also been shown to help with weight loss and improve body composition. ( 5 ) (And if you’re looking to gain in the other direction, check out the best protein powders for weight gain .) An all natural, non-GMO, fat-free whey that's cheaper than many competitors, Legion Whey Isolate Protein Powder is made from 100 percent grass-fed whey protein isolate from sustainable dairy farms in Ireland. It's also higher in calcium compared to other powders on the market. Women over the age of 50 may need even more protein than they think. One study suggests women in this age bracket may benefit from consuming 35 grams of protein per meal. ( 6 ) Since consuming 105 grams of protein per day — assuming you eat three square meals a day at 35 grams of protein each — can seem daunting, many women turn to protein powders for a quick fix. The best clean protein powders sometimes hone in on ingredient quality over protein content, but Legion Whey+ boasts both natural ingredients and a high protein content. Legion Whey+ contains between 21 and 23 grams of protein depending on flavor (about 5 grams of protein more than you’ll find in the best protein bars). We also appreciate how much attention Legion gives to where its protein is sourced from. The brand uses grass-fed whey protein isolate derived from small dairy farms in Ireland. Additionally, Whey+ is certified by Truly Grass Fed and Animal Welfare Approved, which means the grass-fed cows used in protein production are kept in as ideal conditions as possible without any antibiotics or hormones added to their respective diets. BarBend worked with an accredited lab to gather testing data on the overall purity of more than 150 protein powders, including Legion Whey+. It tested among the top 10% cleanest proteins when it came to pesticides, phthalates, bisphenols, and label accuracy. For heavy metals, this Legion sample ranked in the top 50% of cleanest protein powders.  Legion Whey+ can also be a suitable pick for women following a low-carb diet. According to our tester, a certified personal trainer, “I like the macro breakdown of this protein powder. It delivers a good amount of protein while keeping carbohydrates to a minimum — between 2 and 6 grams per serving depending on your flavor of choice.” Speaking of flavors, we give this protein powder a 4 out of 5 for taste. Our tester enjoyed the Cinnamon Cereal offering, comparing it to a particular breakfast staple that’s probably already in your pantry. “Also, the Dutch Chocolate flavor was honestly delicious,” they add. “It wasn’t too sweet and it definitely had a rich flavor . ” Plus, the 16 available flavors can make fighting off flavor fatigue a breeze when routinely taking down the best protein shakes . It is worth noting that there are protein powders that offer more protein per serving than Legion Whey+. Our expert, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, put it best: “Legion Whey+ scores a 4.75 out of 5 for its formula. It’s not the most protein-dense protein powder, but its macro ratios and ingredient sources are impressive.” If you’re really struggling to hit that high protein requirement after the age of 50, you can find higher sources of protein from brands like Transparent Labs and Muscle Milk, but the macros here are on point. Read our full Legion Whey+ Review . This vanilla-flavored protein powder is designed specifically for expecting and newfound mothers with traceable ingredients at worthwhile dosages. Additionally, Essential Protein Pregnancy and Postpartum delivers 250 milligrams of essential choline per serving, a vital component that can help support fetal development during pregnancy and lactation. Pregnancy and strength training are not at odds, and if you want a protein powder to support your health and wellness during and after your pregnancy, we recommend this plant-based option from Ritual. The brand itself has its roots in supporting expecting parents, too. Ritual founder Katerina Schneider built the brand with a mission to create products with traceable ingredients after her search for a trusted prenatal vitamin during her own pregnancy came up short. The transparency at play with Essential Protein Pregnancy and Postpartum is top-notch, earning it a 5 out of 5 in the category. Every ingredient can be traced back to its manufacturer, painting a clear picture along the way for women and birthing parents looking for the best possible ingredients to support their journey. One ingredient our tester really appreciated was the 250 milligrams of essential choline. Studies suggest that choline can be vital for fetal development during pregnancy and lactation stages. ( 7 ) Additionally, we appreciate how this dosage is over half the recommended daily allotment of 450 milligrams, making it easier to hit the choline goal each and every day. ( 8 ) As far as taste is concerned, there isn’t a ton of variety with this protein powder. Ritual only offers Essential Protein Pregnancy and Postpartum in Vanilla, and our tester, a certified nutrition coach, states that the flavor is somewhat underwhelming on its own. “I definitely noticed the pea-based protein source, but the sweetness of the vanilla helped mask everything. I’d recommend using this powder in a smoothie with other ingredients over consuming it as a standalone shake,” they say. Ritual supplements also tend to consistently score a 5 out of 5 in terms of solubility. “I mixed my sample with just water and was pleasantly surprised by the smooth texture,” our tester said of the Daily Essential Shake. “The powder dissolved easily in my shaker bottle, and I didn’t experience any clumps or floating residue.” Lastly, this Ritual protein powder is not for every budget. At $2.93 per serving, it’s one of the more expensive powders we’ve tried over the years. There are more affordable products, though, so check out our list of the best protein powders for pregnancy if you’re looking to save a few bucks. A grass-fed whey isolate includes added ingredients for digestion like seven digestive enzymes and a probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus). It's also gluten-free, sugar-free, and soy-free. Grass-fed cows are raised in some of the most ideal conditions possible, allowing them to graze on fields rather than being fed with hormone- and antibiotic-riddled food. If you’re an athlete that values where your nutrition is coming from, Onnit’s Whey Protein Powder can be a viable option to consider. This option sources its protein from grass-fed Irish dairy cows from farms that meet Animal Welfare Approved standards. This means that the cows always have access to pasture and can graze freely on ranges free of any pollution or contamination. ( 9 ) The result? An excellent source of grass-fed whey protein isolate in each serving — 20 grams to be exact. “I like the macronutrient ratio that Onnit Whey Protein provides — 20 grams of protein, around 2 grams of fat, and 3 to 4 grams of carbs,” says BarBend expert reviewer and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, scoring the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “And I like that Onnit includes an enzyme blend in their ingredients to help promote good digestion.” We scored the solubility a 5 out of 5, but our tester notes a thinness to the texture. “ This powder dissolved almost too well,” they say. “I didn’t have any clumps in my shaker cup but still, it was a little too thin for my liking.” As such, they recommend mixing this powder with your preferred milk of choice over water. “The texture is extremely thin, and I feel like you lose some flavor when using water with this formulation,” they say. “You do get ample richness when mixed with oat milk or whole milk, though.” For a constant rotation of flavors, you’re likely to be left underwhelmed with this pick, as there are only Vanilla and Mexican Chocolate options available, and those scored just a 3.75 out of 5 from our tester. If variety is what you’re after, we’d recommend the vast flavor rosters of protein powders from brands like Transparent Labs and Legion. Read our full Onnit Whey Protein Review . This whey isolate from Momentous offers 20 grams of protein with only 100 calories per serving. In addition to the protein, there's also 90mg of calcium and 115mg of potassium, as well as an enzyme blend to help aid digestion. For athletes who want a solid whey protein powder, our team recommends Momentous Whey. Per serving, you get 20 grams of whey protein isolate with only 3 grams of carbs and 0 grams of fat. “Momentous Whey Protein Isolate scores a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer. She did have to deduce a few points due to the cost per serving, though. At $2.70 per serving, this is among the pricier protein powders on this list, earning a 1 out of 5 for the cost category. “ Momentous Whey Protein Isolate powder is more expensive than many competing brands, but you get what you pay for. It is backed by science and formulated with the help of registered dietitians ,” she says. You can definitely find cheaper products on the market, though — if a budget powder is what you’re after, check out offerings from Nutricost or Jacked Factory. Overall, though, our team really enjoyed the flavor. “The chocolate flavor is rich and a lot like hot chocolate,” one tester says, giving the taste a 4 out of 5. “I would certainly buy this flavor and drink it again.” Plus, our testers also enjoyed the smooth texture. Our testers mixed two scoops (a double dose) with 20 ounces of water and were surprised by the smoothness of the consistency. “I found it to blend really well, even with two scoops,” says our tester, scoring the solubility a 5 out of 5. We like that Momentous is third-party tested, too. This whey protein is Informed Sport certified, so, for competing athletes, this protein is perfectly safe to consume before a meet.  BarBend also worked with an independent accredited lab to examine the purity and label accuracy of Momentous Whey Isolate protein. Momentous Whey earned high marks for its lack of pesticides, phthalates, and heavy metals, overall ranking in the top 50% of proteins we had tested. Read our full Momentous Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate Review . Orgain Organic Protein Plant Based Powder offers 21 grams of protein per serving, along with 5 grams of fiber and net carbs! Sometimes, you’re in the market for protein powders because you’re in the market for gains. Other times, you’re mostly focused on your health. For the athletes who want both, you may be looking for a solid amount of quality protein per serving and organically-sourced ingredients. That’s what you’ll find in Orgain’s Organic Plant-Based Protein, one of the best vegan protein powders we’ve tested. “Orgain Plant-Based Protein is a blend of nutrition powerhouses–brown rice, chia seed, and pea proteins,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, who scores the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “I love that many of this product’s flavors provide a significant portion of your daily iron needs in just one serving. Up to 35 percent of your iron needs can be met in two scoops of this plant-based protein powder! I also love its versatility. It’s gluten-free, vegan, Kosher-friendly, and made without soy ingredients, meaning it can fit into many diets.” Both of our testers noted that the hefty serving size (46 grams!) makes for a thick shake. Now, that can be a good thing and a bad thing. “I don’t typically drink vegan protein powder in just water (ew),” one of our testers said, “ I make an exception for this. It’s so thick because of the two scoop-serving that it works nicely .” That’s the good part. The less good part is, our testers agreed that you probably need a blender to make the most out of any drink with Orgain Organic Plant-Based Protein. And while that might be totally fine for you, it’s less convenient if you’re on the go and just want to toss everything into your shaker bottle. With just a shaker bottle, our testers noted that it was tough to mix. “You get some grit in it from just a basic mix ,” they say, scoring solubility a 3 out of 5. (If you’re looking for a vegan powder with excellent solubility, we recommend Ritual’s offerings.) Once you get the job done, though, our testers note that Orgain is especially smooth for a vegan powder. “I’d use some extra liquid, say 12 ounces. If you do that, this does actually have a creamy texture from that creamer base.” Taste scored a 4 out of 5. The overall verdict? “I love it, ” one of our testers said. “If you’re looking for one of the best organic protein powders, this vegan protein powder is your product.” Read our full Orgain Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder Review . The BarBend team is made up of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. To determine the best whey protein powders available today, we’ve tested over 100 different profiles from the industry’s best brands, using the BarBend supplement testing methodology to rate each high-quality profile on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Below are some of the categories and components that played into our rankings. While whey protein is probably the protein powder you have seen the most, it’s not the only type of protein out there. Here are a few of the different types of protein you can expect to find throughout your search. Casein, like whey, is derived from milk. However, unlike whey, casein digests quite slowly and is often the type of protein people choose to consume before bed — it may help repair muscles as it slowly digests overnight. ( 10 ) Whey isolate is a form of whey that goes through a filtration process to remove a good amount of the lactose — it’s not totally lactose-free, but it is much easier on the stomach for those sensitive to lactose than, say, a whey concentrate powder. If you only have a mild sensitivity, our expert, Janel Reeves, MS, RDN, has some assurance for you: “You will most likely be able to tolerate the amount of lactose in whey isolate,” she says — WIN. Plus, it’s typically lower in carbs and fat than whey concentrates. Whey concentrate is a bit more filling than whey isolate since it doesn’t go through that filtration process. However, this means it’s also a bit higher in carbs and fats. Whey concentrate is the most basic form of whey you’ll find on the market. This protein powder is exposed to heat or enzymes that break down some of the amino bonds. This can help it digest and absorb a bit easier, but this is a much less common form of whey across the market (meaning it can also be a bit more expensive). Plant-based proteins typically come as a blend of different plant powders, like hemp, pea, rice, and soy protein powders. By blending these different types together, manufacturers can often achieve a fuller amino acid profile (comparable to that of whey protein) than if they were to just use one of the plant proteins on its own. There are good reasons that protein powders have become so popular with male and female athletes alike. Protein powder benefits can include improved body composition, increased satiety, and convenience. Protein powders for women can vary in price fairly widely, with whey concentrates usually being the most cost-effective option and whey isolate or hydrolysate being the most expensive. Plant-based proteins usually fall in the middle-to-high price range. If you’re purchasing a tub of protein, you can expect to spend anywhere from around $40 to $65 for a container. That only tells half the story, though, as you need to consider the cost per serving too. There are a variety of protein powders that are marketed directly to women, but they might not always be the ones that are right for you. Here are some key points that may help to keep in mind that may help you in your search for the right protein. If you have trouble digesting protein powder or are lactose intolerant, you’ll have to take care to select a protein that won’t upset your stomach every time you take it. Usually, if you have mild lactose intolerance, whey isolate is pure enough to not cause any issues. If your stomach gurgles when you so much as look at dairy, then a whey hydrolysate or a plant-based protein may be what you need — more on that in our best dairy-free protein powders roundup. The price of a tub of protein only tells you how much it would cost if you took the entire container as one big shake, which we do not recommend doing. Calculating the price per serving can offer much more useful information. Simply divide the total price of the tub by the number of servings it contains, and you’ll see how much each scoop is costing you. This can help you budget better and see which protein powders are truly a good deal. The old saying says that variety is the spice of life, and while we don’t want our protein powder to be spicy, it can be nice to change things up every once in a while. If you’re a creature of habit, then you might be okay with drinking the same protein shake in the same flavor every day. Others might need a bit more pizzazz with a variety of flavor options in unique tantalizing choices. It’s important to consider this and look at which flavors you can select before committing to one protein powder. The reason you’re drinking a protein shake, at its core, is to ingest more protein. Because of that, it’s often helpful to consider the amount of protein each serving of a product provides. Often you’ll find doses of around 20 grams to 25 grams per scoop. On the higher end, some protein powders can have almost 30 grams in a serving. Make sure your protein powder of choice is aligned with your macronutrient needs. Remember, too, that protein powders should be supplemental to your daily intake rather than your sole source of protein — the best nutritional regimen is one that’s built on whole foods first followed by worthwhile supplements. Protein powders for women can range in price depending on the type of protein and other special additions. Generally, you can pick up a tub for around $40 to $65. It can be helpful to consider the price per serving, too, which ranges from about $1.30 to nearly $3. There are so many high-quality protein powders out there for women to choose from that it’s difficult to select just one. We’re big fans of Transparent Labs Whey Protein Powder, though, thanks to its very large dose of 28 grams of protein per serving coupled with no fat and only a solitary carb. It’s also made from whey isolate, which may digest more quickly than other types of protein and can help prevent bloating. There’s nothing about protein powders that make them inherently only to be used by one specific gender, but there are some general guidelines that we used to select ones that would be particularly beneficial for women. We tried to choose proteins that are easy to digest and relatively minimal — bonus points if a powder also contains vitamins and minerals like B vitamins and iron. If you’re trying to lose weight, a calorie deficit is essential, so a lower-calorie protein shake can help you consume more protein without extra calories. We think Gainful Vegan Protein is a great option here as it contains only 110 calories per serving. The combination of whey protein supplements and resistance training has been shown to help improve vitamin B12 levels, which may impact energy levels and optimize resting metabolism. ( 14 ) It depends on your goals. If you’re looking to build muscle, you may want to find a casein protein that digests slowly and can help revive your muscles while you sleep. If you’re looking to lean out, you may opt for a whey isolate protein that is not only low in calories but can also help improve lean muscle mass. The lowest calorie option on our list is a plant-based protein (Gainful Vegan Protein), but keep in mind, some other vegan protein powder options are actually higher in carbohydrates and lower in protein, so read the labels carefully. This isn’t a one size fits all situation — the best type of protein will be the best option to suit your individual goals.

    "text": "The best protein powders have been longstanding solutions for many who struggle to meet their protein goals with whole foods alone. But in today’s busy world, many people value the convenience of grab-and-go protein drinks like OWYN’s Plant-Based Protein Shake. As a registered dietitian, I totally get it — I’m always looking for convenient, nutritionally-balanced ways to get your protein in — but can a pre-made beverage act as a worthwhile substitute for tried-and-true powder? In our opinion, OWYN Protein Shakes can be a high-quality, convenient protein option for those on the go. We also appreciate the plant-based nature of these shakes, which can be excellent for athletes following a vegan diet. In this OWYN Protein Shake review, our expert testers — including registered dietitians, certified nutrition coaches, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts — will rate and examine this plant-based protein drink with guidance from our supplement testing methodology , similar to our experience with over 100 (yes, 100!) other protein supplements, to date. Ready to see how the “Only What You Need” brand stacks up to the competition? Let’s get into our findings. OWYN protein shakes can deliver, as the name suggests, “Only What You Need,” thanks to a clean blend of plant-based protein sources with minimal calories, carbs, and fat per serving. We also appreciate the roster of available flavors, although we’d appreciate further details regarding the third-party testing accreditation.

The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. OWYN is an acronym for “Only What You Need,” the company’s guiding principle behind how they craft their products. OWYN ready-to-drink protein shakes are formulated to hit all the essentials without any unnecessary fluff, taking a page from some of the best clean protein powders we’ve had in trials. Each shake is made with ingredients free from the top nine allergens (peanuts, tree nuts, soy, milk, shellfish, fish, egg, wheat, and sesame), meaning each serving is dairy-free, gluten-free, and soy-free. So, what is included in an OWYN Protein Shake? OWYN shakes are made with 100% non-dairy, plant-based ingredients. We’re talking pea protein, organic pumpkin seed protein, monk fruit extract, and a greens blend for added micronutrients and digestive support. Each bottle contains roughly 180 calories, 20 grams of protein, and 535 milligrams of omega-3 fatty acids with minimal carb (8 grams) and fat counts (7 grams), too. If you’re like me, you’ll also be hyped to know that OWYN protein shakes contain all nine essential amino acids — a major plus for athletes following a vegan diet ! Our bodies can’t make essential amino acids, so we must get them from our diet. Missing out on these amino acids can limit your protein’s ability to support muscle protein synthesis — the process where the body builds, strengthens, and repairs muscle tissue. ( 3 ) It’s imperative, then, to seek out “complete proteins” to help your macronutrient work for your needs. “ Protein is critical for every cell in the body. It is a building block for muscle, hair, skin, nails, and helps build and repair tissue in the body, ” says Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. Like other samples of the best protein shakes , OWYN protein shakes are offered in a range of flavors, which our tester, a certified personal trainer, does appreciate. “Typically, I steer clear of the ‘planty’ sensations of plant-based protein options, but these tasted good enough that I wouldn’t mind keeping a few in stock for particularly rushed days or travel,” they add. Available flavors include such options as Strawberry Banana, Smooth Vanilla, Dark Chocolate, Cold Brew Coffee, and Cookies & Creamless. You can purchase a 12-pack of OWYN’s protein shakes for $36.99, which equates to roughly $3.08 per serving. While this is more expensive than your typical protein powder, you do need to account for the added convenience of its pre-made profile. Additionally, the listed shelf life of these beverages is 18 months prior to opening, meaning you can keep them stored without much hassle as you work through your order. It seems like the world is spinning faster and faster every day. Ready-to-drink protein supplements can be a game-changer when you’re short on protein and short on time. However, OWYN Plant-Based Protein Shakes may not be the right choice for everyone. Below, we’ve outlined a few groups that may benefit from these pre-made protein drinks along with some camps that may fare better with an alternative pick. Our expert tester, a certified personal trainer, is all too familiar with protein’s role in post-workout recovery and overall wellness. That said, they rarely opt for the best vegan protein powders over their more favored lactose-containing formulations. As a testament to their dedication, our tester trialed OWYN protein shakes for multiple weeks, compiling their testing notes and experiences to rate these pre-made protein drinks on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) across a variety of categories. Here are some of the top findings from said trials. OWYN protein shakes have a pretty solid formulation, overall, earning a 4 out of 5 from our tester. Each shake provides around 180 calories and 20 grams of protein per serving. OWYN uses a vegan-friendly protein blend made from pea protein, organic pumpkin seed protein, and organic flaxseed oil. Why is this registered dietitian so jazzed about pea protein? I’m so glad you asked! It’s one of the few plant-based protein supplements that contains all nine essential amino acids. ( 1 ) I love an easily-accessible, complete protein for my vegan friends. Additionally, each shake contains 5 grams of net carbs, or 8 grams of carbohydrates and 3 grams of fiber. However, OWYN shakes are sweetened with organic cane sugar and monk fruit extract, totaling 4 grams of added sugar. This may be a positive if you’re not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but it could be a dealbreaker if you are trying to limit your sugar consumption each day. Each bottle also contains a notable 7 grams of fat. This may help you feel fuller longer, and a good portion of it comes from vegan omega-3 fatty acids. OWYN shakes are made with alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 that has been linked to anti-inflammatory properties. ( 2 ) Last, but not least, OWYN breaks the mold of your standard protein shake by adding a greens blend for extra digestive support. Each shake contains a blend of broccoli, kale, and spinach, adding a boost of micronutrients like iron and potassium. The best-tasting protein powders are typically the ones you stick with the longest, and pre-made protein shakes are no different. It’s one thing when making your protein shakes at home — you control the ingredient list, so you control the taste. However, when it comes to pre-made drinks, their flavor is entirely in the hands of the manufacturer. You’re at the mercy of what they think tastes good. Many fall short, but OWYN totally knocked it out of the park, according to our tester, earning a perfect 5 out of 5 for taste. “ Being pea and pumpkin seed protein , you’d expect a bit of that grassy flavor,” says our tester, “But you really don’t get it at all, particularly in the vanilla one — I’m shocked. ” During trials, our tester was able to sample the Vanilla and Dark Chocolate varieties, stating that the vanilla profile was the far sweeter option. “There’s also a confetti-cake-like taste to it, which can be appealing to some palates,” they add. Dark chocolate was (naturally) more rich, but they suggested adding it to your morning iced coffee for a sweet alternative to your morning hit of caffeine. If chocolate and vanilla aren’t your jam, OWYN offers other delicious flavors, including Strawberry Banana, Cold Brew Coffee, and Cookies & Creamless. They even offer variety packs so you can try more than one flavor per order! Solubility isn’t a huge factor for pre-made protein shakes — there’s no mixing to be had — but texture sure is. Our tester gave OWYN shakes a 4 out of 5 in this category, saying, “ They’re thinner than other pre-made protein shakes I’ve had — Orgain and Muscle Milk come to mind as those ones are really thick and creamy — so these feel less substantial in a way. I’d equate the texture of these to if you mixed the average protein powder with milk (vs water) .” Of course, you can alter the texture of your beverage by adding OWYN protein shakes to other drinks like coffee or smoothies. Be sure to play around with different recipes and find a blend that suits your palate best. OWYN protein shakes aren’t the most expensive protein drink on the market, but they aren’t the cheapest, either. A 12-pack will set you back $36.99, or around $3.08 per bottle. Our tester scored them right in the middle for price with a 3 out of 5, saying, “They’re more expensive than a traditional protein powder , but you are paying for the pre-made convenience. Plus, I appreciate that OWYN is available in 12-bottle packages and offers subscription-based delivery services for added discounts. ” You can also find these cartons amongst the best protein powders on Amazon , opening the door for potential shipping discounts via Prime. OWYN does some third-party testing, but it’s nothing that truly blows our socks off. It’s not as comprehensive as we’d prefer from a high-quality supplement, especially for products not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OWYN tests for the top nine allergens, but there’s no indication that they also verify the supplement’s purity and label accuracy. Moreover, OWYN doesn’t disclose which organization performs the testing, nor does it provide the Certificates of Analysis on the brand’s retail page. As a result, our tester gave OWYN a 3 out of 5 for its third-party testing. Here at BarBend, we’ve tested more than 100 protein supplements, including over 20 pre-made protein shakes from a range of popular brands. We’ve tried the good, the bad, and the “OMG, what was that?” Through trial and error, we’ve developed insight into what makes a protein shake worth your penny (spoiler alert — it’s not marketing terms like “superfoods” and “clean ingredients”). When shopping for a ready-to-drink protein shake, be sure to look at the big picture. Let the nutrition facts speak for themselves, but don’t discount the convenience factor, either. Below are some top factors worth considering when choosing your ideal protein shake. If you’ve ever felt overwhelmed by the number of options when shopping for the best protein bars , protein powders, and drinks, you’re not alone. It can definitely be overwhelming, but we got your back. We stacked OWYN protein shakes against a couple of worthwhile competitors — Premier Protein Shakes and Jocko Molk Protein Shakes — to see how they compare to one another. What is the primary difference between OWYN and the alternatives listed above? OWYN is 100% plant-based, while Premier and Jocko Molk are made with milk protein. As a result, you’ll notice their macro profiles are slightly different. Premier and Jocko Molk contain more protein (10 more grams per bottle) than OWYN, along with fewer fats and carbs. Depending on your health goals, whether they be weight loss, gaining muscle , or general wellness, these metrics could play a major part in your decision. Fewer carbs and less fat mean your shake may be less satiating, leaving you feeling hungry sooner. You’ll also notice that OWYN’s cost falls right in the middle, with Jocko Molk costing more at roughly $3.75 while Premier Protein Shakes can be picked up for less than $2 per serving (depending on flavor). You can purchase OWYN plant-based protein shakes from a number of online retailers, including, but not limited to: If you need something with a bit more protein, the OWYN Pro Elite shakes might be worth a look. They’re a low-carb, high-protein version of OWYN’s standard protein shakes. Each carton contains 7 grams of fat, 3 grams of carbs, and 32 grams of protein. Past and current customers have really hyped up the OWYN brand. With almost 15,000 online reviews, OWYN boasts an impressive 4.2-out-of-5 rating on Amazon. People appreciate the plant-based formula, high-quality ingredients, and enjoyable flavors. Many reviews highlight the lack of artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols like sucralose or stevia, as well. “Packed with goodness, perfect for breakfast, lunch, a snack, or just because I love them so much!” raves one positive customer response. Thankfully, OWYN seems well-received because the brand’s refund policy is limited. The protein shakes are non-returnable and do not come with a guarantee of satisfaction. As a registered dietitian, I’m a big fan of prioritizing some of the most nutrient-dense foods when building out your nutrition plan. But let’s be real — sometimes, life is crazy, and the only way to meet your daily protein needs is to grab a protein shake as you run out the door. We think OWYN protein shakes hit the mark in most categories. Our expert tester knows the value of a good protein supplement and had an overall good experience with the flavors they tried. OWYN shakes can be an ideal option if you follow a plant-based diet, too, or simply just want to include more plant-based protein in your diet. They can be an efficient way to boost your protein intake, albeit at a higher cost than your traditional protein powder. Still considering? Use the aforementioned tips and tricks to help you land on the perfect protein source for your daily needs and goals. OWYN protein shakes can be a healthy addition to a well-balanced diet, but they should not be your sole source of protein each day. According to Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD, “Your well-balanced diet should consist of a range of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Supplements, then, should serve as supplemental goods to help you reach your daily nutritional goals.” While it’s generally safe to drink a protein supplement daily, it’s important to account for your overall diet and nutrient needs. Protein needs can vary between individuals based on medical history, activity levels, and health goals. A registered dietitian can help you effectively incorporate a protein shake into your diet. OWYN protein shakes cost around $3.08 per bottle. However, OWYN also offers subscription-based services featuring discounted order totals in exchange for repeat deliveries. No, OWYN protein shakes do not contain enough carbohydrates or fat to be considered a full meal-replacement shake.

    "text": "Diet culture feels more ubiquitous than ever before. Gone are the days where most folks would grab a hard roll, slather on some butter, and get on with their lives. Now, there’s a seemingly endless number of ways one can eat to lose weight, gain muscle, boost focus, and feel healthier while tackling the best weight loss programs . And a lot of people are following different diets. A 2017 study found that approximately 42% of the general population reported trying to lose weight during the previous year, only fueling the already intense weight loss industry. ( 1 ) The global market for weight loss dietary supplements was estimated at $43.9 billion in 2022 and is projected to increase to a staggering $135.7 billion by 2030. ( 2 ) Searching for diet advice online can be exhausting, especially because not all meal plans marketed as “healthy diets” have the science and evidence to back up their claims. By better understanding the most common diet plan types, you can decide which one works best for your healthy lifestyle and overall goals (whether that’s to slim down, bulk up, or be healthier). Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. None of these supplements are meant to treat or cure any disease. If you feel you may be deficient in a particular nutrient or nutrients, please seek out a medical professional. Caloric restriction is often the assumption when someone says, “I’m on a diet, ” however, we’ll be discussing a variety of diets. So, what exactly is a diet? Is it the food you eat daily? Yes. If someone eats burgers every meal, that’s their diet. But it can also be an action taken, both short-term and long-term, to adjust your current diet to achieve a goal such as building more muscle, losing weight, or improving health. Some actionable diets can be used for short bouts of time to reach a specific goal, however, your long term dietary plan — your diet — should be something you can healthily maintain. Before we dive into the different types of diets, it’s important to note that none of these options are the be-all, end-all for your health needs. You can lose weight on just about any diet, so long as you’re in a caloric deficit (that is, you burn more calories than you consume). ( 5 ) The same is true if you’re looking to put on some muscle mass. No diet is necessarily better than the other in accomplishing this. Prioritize calorie intake first, and make sure you’re hitting your protein goals. Then, choose a diet style based on your preference and the food groups you want to incorporate. Studies have also shown that the quality of food is just as, if not more, important than the number of macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fats) you take in. ( 6 ) In other words, if you’re following a low-carb diet, you need to make sure you’re eating quality fats and protein, too. On the flip, opt for whole grains over refined starches if eating a diet lower in fat. Lastly, some diets may lack vital micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) necessary for everyday life — vegetarians, for example, are more likely to develop an iron deficiency than their meat-eating counterparts. Iron deficiencies can lead to anemia, the symptoms of which include fatigue, chest pain, and even pale skin. Of course, you should always consult a doctor, but eating a wider variety of food or taking a supplement may help with any deficiencies. That said, here’s a list of the more popular diets and what they’re all about. If this isn’t your first foray into researching different types of diets, you may already be familiar with intermittent fasting , also known as IF. For the uninitiated, IF doesn’t focus on what to eat but instead emphasizes when you can eat it. Using this eating strategy, you consume all of your calories in a set time period and then fast for the rest of the day. There are different approaches to intermittent fasting, with the most popular being an 8:16 split—meaning you consume your day’s total calories in an eight-hour eating window and fast for the remaining 16 hours of the day. However, there are endless ways to structure your time. Some people opt for a 10:14 eating: fasting split, as it’s more lenient and realistic for their schedule. Intermittent fasting may also look like a 5:2 fast, where you eat normally five days a week and restrict your calories on the other two days. The concept is that you’ll be eating fewer calories since you’re squeezing them into a narrower timeframe, as opposed to consuming them throughout the day. During the fasting period, you’re allowed zero-calorie beverages such as black coffee, herbal teas, and sparkling and flat water. It’s important to note that while IF may offer some health benefits, it’s not appropriate for everyone. Check with your doctor or registered dietitian before starting an IF diet. As the name suggests, the Mediterranean diet is inspired by the healthy eating habits of people who live near the Mediterranean Sea. Those countries, including Greece, Italy, Spain, Lebanon, Turkey, and more, have some of the longest life expectancies in the world. Could their diets be to thank? Evidence-based research has linked the Mediterranean diet with longer life expectancies. According to a recently published study, the average global life expectancy is 69.5 years, but Italy, known for its diet rich in olive oil and fresh produce, boasts an average life expectancy of 81.6 years. ( 15 ) The diet is rich in heart-healthy foods such as vegetables, fish, fruit, grains, olive oil, and nuts. Consumption of red meat and sweets with added sugar or honey is kept to a minimum, and dairy intake is moderate and consists of high-quality sources such as yogurt and cheeses. In recent years, the ketogenic diet has arguably been one of the most discussed and debated diets. Consider how long the Atkins diet has been a topic of conversation. Even if you’re not a follower, you’ve no doubt seen specially designed keto snacks on store shelves for its devotees. The ketogenic diet, or keto, as it’s called for short, was originally developed to help treat childhood epilepsy. Fast-forward 100 years, and it’s a popular fad diet for weight loss. It’s characterized by its high fat (70 to 80 percent of your daily calories), moderate protein (10 to 20 percent), and minimal carb content (only about 5 to 10 percent, though some versions prohibit carbs altogether). ( 20 ) This means you’ll be eating a lot of avocados, eggs, and bunless cheeseburgers. The keto diet was designed to keep the body in a near-constant state of ketosis, a metabolic state where the body creates ketones from fat to use as energy instead of sugar from carbs (the body’s primary and preferred energy source). ( 20 ) [Related: Ketogenic Diet Strength Training ] Most people fall off their diets because they’re too regimented — you have to eat the same thing day after day. Eating chicken, rice, and broccoli on repeat is miserable for most folks. Enter the IIFYM diet , or “If It Fits Your Macros” — a more flexible dieting approach that lets you eat whatever you want as long as you hit your pre-determined protein, carb, and fat targets. First, you must determine how much of each macronutrient you need to eat per day to accomplish your goals, whether to lose weight or gain weight. The amount of each macronutrient a person needs will change based on that specific person and their goals. Nutrition needs are individualized, but the acceptable macronutrient range says you should get 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories from carbs, 20 to 35 percent from fat, and 10 to 35 percent from protein. ( 4 ) You can use our macros calculator as a starting point. (As ever, consulting with a registered dietitian will yield the most personalized results.) From there, make sure that everything you eat fits into those macros by tracking what you eat on an app like MyFitnessPal. You can eat a slice of pizza or your favorite Little Debbie cake so long as you don’t go over your carb or fat limit. Veganism is one of the fastest-growing movements in the United States. The number of Americans who follow a veg diet increased by 600 percent from 2014 to 2018, and the plant-based diet market increased by 29 percent between 2017 and 2019, highlighting an increased interest in meat alternatives like Beyond Burgers. ( 23 ) [Related: Strongest Vegans on Earth ] While mainstream media considers it a diet, wherein followers avoid animal-based products, some consider it a lifestyle (many vegans avoid wearing any leather or animal hide). A few years ago, vegans would only eat beans, legumes, grains, egg-free pasta, fruits, and vegetables. However, advances in technology have allowed the alternative meat industry to provide vegans (and those following a vegetarian diet) access to a wider variety of products. What if your mother’s advice to eat your vegetables was a lie? That’s the essence of the carnivore diet, the antithesis of veganism. Carnivore devotees only eat animal-based products — meat, cheese, milk, animal-based fats, and eggs (though some variations only allow meat, no eggs, and dairy). There are no grains, no vegetables, and no fruits. No, that’s not a joke. Also known as the zero carb diet, the carnivore diet is basically a variation of the keto diet since fats and proteins are prioritized over carbs. This dietary approach flies in the face of scientific research that suggests that limiting your meat intake can extend your life and improve cardiovascular health. Still, its followers have claimed it can fight inflammation and prevent nutrient deficiencies. There is some research suggesting that it can lead to weight loss, especially since protein increases the body’s thermic effect of feeding — the energy it takes to digest food. ( 28 ) The paleo diet , sometimes called “The Caveman Diet,” could be considered a cousin of the carnivore diet. It emphasizes foods that early humans, our hunter-gatherer ancestors, are thought to have eaten. ( 32 ) This diet prioritizes whole foods such as fish, vegetables, fruit, nuts, and seeds, in addition to meat. It also avoids grains, dairy, processed foods, beans, legumes, and sugars. You may start each morning with a plate of eggs and some oatmeal, but how would you feel about finishing that with a cookie or a slice of cake? Well, you can on the dessert with breakfast diet. This diet is exactly what it sounds like — a sugary treat first thing in the morning. It sounds too good to be true, but there’s evidence it works for different goals. A 2012 study in the journal Steroids found that people who ate high-carb and high-protein foods for their meal that included a dessert lost more weight and kept it off for the duration of the eight-month-long study than those who had a low-carb, high-protein breakfast. ( 36 ) Thanks to endorsements from Adele and British royal Pippa Middleton, the sirtfood diet has grown in popularity in recent years. Created by nutritionists Aidan Goggins and Glen Matten, the diet focuses on foods high in sirtuins (SIRTs), a group of proteins found in the body that regulate metabolism, and calorie restriction for weight loss. Some foods high in SIRTs include red wine, dark chocolate, walnuts, kale, buckwheat, Medjool dates, walnuts, arugula, coffee, capers, and extra-virgin olive oil. However, following the sirtfood diet isn’t as simple as just eating those foods. ( 38 ) Goggins and Matten prescribe a two-phase approach in their book. In the first three days of phase one, you only drink three green juices and eat one full meal rich in sirtfoods, amounting to 1,000 calories for three days. [Related: Benefits of Green Powders ] On days four to seven, your caloric intake goes up to 1,500. Then, in phase two, you eat three sirtfood-rich meals and drink one green juice per day for two weeks. After that, you can either repeat that process or stick to a diet rich in sirts while continuing to drink at least one juice per day. Unfortunately, research surrounding the sirtfood diet and its long-term effects is limited. The word diet isn’t just for those looking for a weight-loss plan. It refers to anything we eat daily, whether we’re trying to lose, gain, or maintain weight. Remember that the best diet for you should be sustainable and help you reach your health and wellness goals without adverse effects.

    "text": "As many an 8th grader could tell you, protein is the building block of muscle. From red meat and legumes to chia seeds and the best protein powders , there are plenty of ways to make sure you’re getting enough in your diet. But how much should you be aiming to consume each day? Whether you’re trying to cut weight, build muscle, or maintain your status quo, our protein intake calculator offers guidance on just how much protein to work into your daily routine. After consulting multiple experts and the latest research, we incorporated science-backed formulas that account for you-specific variables to give you the best possible recommendation for your daily intake. Beyond simple data points like height and weight, we factor in your basal metabolic rate, physical activity level, and your fitness goals to simplify the math and get you on the right path. Check out our protein intake calculator to find your number, then read on for expert-approved strategies for hitting your goals. Medical Disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Exercise: 15-30 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Intense exercise: 45-120 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Very intense exercise: 2+ hours of elevated heart rate activity. According to our expert reviewer Gabrielle Fundaro, Ph.D., CHC, the amount of protein you should take in per day depends on several key factors. “In the broadest of strokes, you should aim to consume about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight , per day,” she says. ( 4 ) “If you exercise regularly (particularly if you lift weights), you may even need a bit more than that.” Because daily recommended values aim to advise such a wide range of people*, our calculator also accounts for a few possible fitness goals — fat loss, maintenance, or muscle gain. According to a 2016 review, “A growing body of research indicates that protein intakes well above the current Recommended Dietary Allowance help to promote healthy aging, appetite regulation, weight management, and goals aligned with athletic performance.” ( 5 ) Since around 10% of your total calories per day should come from protein, our calculator also factors in your basal metabolic rate (BMR) — the number of calories your body burns while at rest. ( 1 ) How does our calculator determine your BMR? It depends on whether you know your current body fat percentage. If you answer “no,” then our calculator uses the widely-accepted Mifflin-St. Jeor equation. ( 6 ) [Related: Best Calorie Calculator ] If you do know your body fat percentage (most likely by completing a DEXA scan), the calculator uses the Katch-McArdle formula. This equation is considered more accurate, but only if you know your exact current body fat percentage. ( 7 ) Most people won’t know that measurement, so unless you’ve had a DEXA scan recently, it’s probably best to choose “no” and go with the number provided by the Mifflin St. Jeor formula. After feeding our protein calculator with all these data points, you’ll get a calorie intake recommendation, along with three amounts for daily protein intake — minimum, generally recommended, and high. So, what should you do with this information? “If you like to hit the gym on a regular basis or are a competitive athlete, your protein needs shoot up dramatically,” Fundaro says. “This is because of protein’s vital supportive function for muscle growth and repair, among other factors.” *Because the overwhelming majority of current nutrition research focuses on cisgender women and cisgender men, those are the only two options available on our calculators. But that doesn’t mean it can’t be used by athletes across the gender spectrum. According to certified nutrition coach, certified personal trainer, and BarBend editorial team member Alex Polish, trans and nonbinary athletes — depending on their hormone replacement therapy (HRT) status — may choose to use their actual gender, their gender assigned at birth, or average the numbers together: “If you’re not on HRT or have been on HRT for less than a year,” they explain, “you might want to use numbers for your gender assigned at birth. If you’ve been on HRT for longer than a year, you can easily go with your actual gender. For nonbinary athletes, you might also lean on your HRT status. Listening to your body is key, as is finding a trans-affirming nutritionist if you can.” “High-quality protein is lean and has all essential amino acids ,” says our expert reviewer Austin Bou, RD, CDCES, ACE-CPT. “Aim for chicken breast without skin, ground meats that are 95% lean, fish, seafood, eggs, and low-fat dairy products . Plant-based alternatives include tofu, tempeh, edamame, quinoa , hemp seeds, and nutritional yeast.” The nutritional information for each of these high-protein foods comes straight from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) website. As BarBend editorial member and certified personal trainer Anthony O’Reilly spells out in his article about how to build muscle , growth starts with…breaking them down? “You damage the muscle fibers with resistance training; whether that’s with your own body weight or heavy iron,” he says. ( 8 ) “Then, your body fuses the fibers back together during the recovery period, which helps make them bigger. This is called hypertrophy, or the enlargement of muscle tissue.” That recovery period is when protein gets to work. “Micro-tears from training are repaired by amino acids, the building blocks of protein,” explains BarBend expert reviewer Kathleen Benson, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified personal trainer. “Without sufficient protein, our muscles lack the necessary building blocks for repair.” After your workout, those amino acids are used to repair damaged muscle fibers on a cellular level. ( 9 ) “If we are not eating enough [protein], our body may begin to break down its own tissues for energy,” Benson adds. “This can be prevented by consuming adequate calories and protein.” The amino acids most closely linked to muscle protein synthesis (MPS) — a process that switches on genes responsible for muscle gain — are the branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. ( 10 )( 11 ) While there are many easily accessible complete protein sources, the best BCAA supplements can also help capitalize on these important amino acids. But as far as whole-food sources go, the availability of essential amino acids can make some options preferable to others. “Our bodies can make some kinds of amino acids — however, there are others that are essential [that] we need to consume,” she says. “Foods that contain all the essential amino acids (i.e. the amino acids we cannot make in our body), like animal proteins, are referred to as high-quality.” While broad factors like exercise regimen, sleep, and total protein intake may be more important than worrying about leucine, studies suggest that about 3 grams per serving is ideal for maintaining MPS. ( 10 )( 11 ) As a key macronutrient, consuming enough protein each day is important for managing weight, as well as building muscle. “Protein is essential for the body, contributing to muscle growth , meal satisfaction, and fullness,” says our expert reviewer Kathleen Benson, RDN, LDN, CSSD, CPT. “It helps stabilize blood sugar levels when combined with carbohydrates and plays other important roles in our body, including enzyme production.” Here are just a few benefits of hitting your daily protein intake. Even if you aren’t trying to bulk up, BarBend expert reviewer Eric Bugera, a certified strength and conditioning specialist, says that consuming enough protein is important for weight loss. “Eating a high-protein diet while in a calorie deficit can help your body preserve fat-free mass.” ( 12 )( 13 ) If cutting a few pounds is your goal, don’t forget to factor in your total calorie intake. “When you want to lose body fat , start by calculating your daily calorie needs, and be sure that you’re resistance training to preserve your lean muscle,” Bugera adds. An ocean of research suggests that — along with proper training — consuming enough protein can lead to muscle protein synthesis and muscle growth. ( 8 )( 14 )( 15 ) “Protein is crucial to your gains,” our expert reviewer and certified personal trainer Anthony O’Reilly explains. “This macronutrient is the building block of all muscles, and without it, your journey to a bigger body will come to a halt.” Your sleep habits and overall diet also play a big role. “Protein helps build muscles and make them stronger, as do the amino acids in protein-rich foods.” ( 16 ) Complete protein sources — like eggs, fish, or poultry — contain all nine essential amino acids, which support building skeletal muscle. ( 10 )( 11 )( 16 ) Because of its impact on hunger-related hormone levels, protein can help you feel fuller for a longer period of time. Studies suggest that a high-protein diet can increase anorexigenic hormone levels while simultaneously decreasing orexigenic hormone levels. ( 17 ) Huh? Essentially, these hormone levels signal that you feel full, which can be helpful when you’re confronted with that extra piece of cheesecake. “Protein can be tracked by weighing and tracking in a food journal app that calculates total protein,” BarBend expert reviewer and registered dietitian nutritionist Kathleen Benson says. “Nutrition-label-capable food scales are also helpful. If weighing out protein isn’t an option, another popular and effective technique for maintaining adequate intake without precise measurements is by using visual guides.” Check out a few of our team’s favorite ways to track your protein intake. For help figuring out how to count macros like protein, our expert reviewer Lacy Puttuck suggests checking out your app store. “Pick an app or another tool (some people like a spreadsheet), to start logging and tracking foods,” she says of apps like My Fitness Pal. “It is important to find one that makes sense to you, fits in your budget (there are many free options), and is convenient for you to use.” The robust libraries of whole and processed food information in protein tracking apps allow you to quickly add foods to your daily intake, then see daily nutrition breakdowns. Lots of these options also let you save recipes or common meals, plus set goals along the way. In addition to collecting all that delicious data, Puttuck loves that they can help educate users. “The important thing is to make sure and learn from your food choices and intake.” “In general, we as humans are not very good at estimating portion sizes,” Puttuck says. “Tools like a food scale, measuring cups and measuring spoons…can be eye-opening and informative.” Many scales are small enough to fit into your pocket, but measuring every single food you eat isn’t the entire point. After several weeks or months of weighing and recording exactly how much protein you’re eating each day, you’ll have a better sense of the protein content different foods provide. By simply arming yourself with information, a seemingly mind-numbing task can quickly become an efficient method to make counting macros easier . Another popular method is to eat “a palm” or two of your favorite protein source. After learning the protein content of a palm’s worth of foods you eat on the reg, you can use that visual to estimate how that amount fits your daily protein needs. “For example, [you could eat] roughly 1.5 palm-sized amounts of animal protein at three meals a day, plus a protein shake or a protein-rich snack,” says Benson. Our calculator factors in your height, weight, age, sex assigned at birth (you can also always input your actual gender, particularly depending on your HRT status), and physical activity level to give you an idea of how much protein you need to consume every day. We also account for your basal metabolic rate (BMR) — the number of calories your body burns while at rest. ( 1 ) Whether you’re figuring out how to gain muscle or manage your weight, your goals will determine how much protein you’ll need each day. There are many variables that determine how many grams of protein you may need in a day, but here are the general guidelines provided by the National Academy of Medicine. Babies should have about 10 grams, while school-age children need around 19 to 34 grams. Teenagers should average roughly 46 to 54 grams and adults need about 46 to 56 grams. ( 19 ) BarBend expert reviewer Eric Bugera, CSCS, CISSN, says that while it’s important to consider your protein intake whether you want to lose or gain weight, don’t forget to watch your calories. Following a high-protein diet can help preserve lean body mass, but staying in a calorie deficit is the only way to see that number on the scale tick down. Remember to consult your healthcare professional before beginning a weight management program.

    "text": "Nitric oxide is a common part of the best supplement stacks , partly thanks to its research-backed effects on blood flow. “Nitric oxide can help relax and widen your blood vessels, which can improve circulation. When you have better blood flow, more oxygen and nutrients can reach your organs and muscles. That’s why it has potential to impact performance, endurance, heart health, and even brain function,” says Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. But let’s make sure one thing is clear — even the best nitric oxide supplements aren’t actually made with nitric oxide. Instead, they’re a mixture of ingredients — primarily L-arginine and L-citrulline — that aim to boost nitric oxide production in the body. Nitric oxide is a gaseous molecule that plays a crucial role in many biological functions — the side effects of nitric oxide include neurotransmission, inflammation, and vasodilation (AKA blood flow, AKA muscle pump). ( 1 ) While there’s still a need for more research regarding its effects on athletic performance, these purported benefits have customers searching for the best nitric oxide supplements on the market. If that’s you, you’ve come to the right place. We’ve tested dozens of products and scored them according to our supplement testing methodology to find the best nitric oxide supplements available today. Medical Disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor or healthcare provider before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Don’t worry — we won’t leave a stone unturned in this review of our top nitric oxide supplements. But after you finish reading this article, head over to YouTube and check out what former BarBend editor Nick English, has to say in his video review of our top nitric oxide supplements of 2025. Transparent Labs Nitric Oxide is a nitric oxide booster that gets straight to the point, earning our pick for the best overall nitric oxide supplement. Its heavy-hitter ingredient is a hearty dose of NO3-T, a patented combination of arginine nitrate and betaine nitrate. Each serving provides 1,250 milligrams (mg) of arginine nitrate and 1,000mg of betaine nitrate. And while there’s very little research available for NO3-T, research shows that combining the two nitrates increases the body’s nitrate stores, supporting a stable, long-lasting production of nitric oxide for your workout. ( 2 ) Another ingredient, 250mg of L-glutathione, may help manage oxidative stress and encourage healthy blood flow. ( 3 ) And those 200mg of vitamin C? They increase the antioxidant content of the nutrition supplement and support nitrate absorption, so it can do its thing in nitric oxide production. ( 4 ) This nitric oxide supplement is in capsule form, requiring four capsules per serving. If you’re not a fan of taking pills, this might be a deal breaker. Transparent Labs Nitric Oxide is highlighted as a pre-workout supplement, but you can take it anytime to help promote blood flow. If you’re taking Nitric Oxide to get a muscle pump before your workout, Transparent Labs recommends taking it 30-45 minutes before exercise on an empty stomach. Each 30-serving container costs $44.99 when ordered as a one-time purchase, costing around $1.50 per serving. However, you can arrange a delivery subscription for a $5 savings and free shipping, bringing the cost to $1.27 per serving. This is pretty average for nitric oxide-supporting products, earning it a 4 out of 5 score for price. Of course, in true Transparent Labs fashion, their Nitric Oxide supplement is third-party tested and Informed Choice certified. As a registered dietitian, I’m a fan of companies that send their supplements for third-party testing. The FDA doesn’t regulate dietary supplements, so I love to see brands go the extra mile to monitor their product’s purity and safety. One of our favorite nitric oxide supplements on Amazon right now is Jacked Factory’s Nitro Surge. Nitro Surge might be the most straightforward formula of their many different pre-workouts, making it an excellent option for those who want a good muscle pump without questionable ingredients. And with Prime shipping, it can be at your doorstep in as little as two days. Nitro Surge supports nitric oxide production thanks to its citrulline content. Each scoop provides 3g of L-citrulline, which might be enough for those new to pre-workout supplements to cash in on nitric oxide benefits . However, Jacked Factory recommends that those with experience with this type of supplement should take two scoops for maximum results. We must agree, as research shows that 6-8g of citrulline is most effective for increasing blood flow. ( 10 ) You’ll need two scoops to hit clinically-researched doses, but one member of the BarBend team, a certified personal trainer thinks this makes it ideal for newbies. “Being able to choose one or two scoops is good for someone starting out with pre-workouts,” they say. “It won’t give you those wild tingles or insane feeling that some other pre-workouts might.” Unfortunately, those who do need 2 scoops to get the job done will have to pay a pretty penny — $1.73 for that higher dose serving. According to BarBend editorial member Matt Cummings, it might be worth the cost. “ I usually work out in the morning, but I tried Nitro Surge in the early afternoon and definitely felt jacked up and ready to go,” he says. “After about 10 seconds of shaking, it mixes up smoothly,” he says, rating its solubility 5 out of 5. “If you leave it sitting, of course it will settle a bit, but I just give it a quick shake before each sip.” Nitro Surge comes in 16 flavors, including Arctic White, Black Cherry, and even Sour Peach Rings. See ya later, flavor fatigue! “I tried the Strawberry Margarita, which is available on Amazon, and I loved it,” our other tester says, giving the taste a 5 out of 5. “I could see myself drinking this at a pool, it’s so delicious.” Another factor to consider is the artificial sweetener used in the formula. Nitro Surge uses sucralose, which may cause gastrointestinal distress in some people and leave an artificial aftertaste for most. Considering that you have to consume two scoops to get clinically based doses and that the product uses sucralose as a sweetener, we gave Nitro Surge a 3.5 out of 5 for its formulation. And while we love how accessible Nitro Surge is in both taste and retail availability, we’d be remiss not to mention that it doesn’t undergo any third-party testing for purity and safety. It scored a 1 out of 5 for third-party testing. Competitive athletes, especially those who may be subjected to drug testing, should keep that in mind. Read our full Jacked Factory Nitro Surge Review . Sometimes, mixing yet another powder supplement is the last thing you want to do, so you turn to capsules. However, not all capsule nitric oxide supplements are created equal. Nutricost’s Nitric Oxide Booster Capsules took home the title for best nitric oxide pills. While you have to take three capsules to get the maximum dose, that’s still far less than other nitric oxide pills on the market. Nutricost aims to improve blood flow and enhance exercise performance with its Nitric Oxide Booster Capsules. Improved blood flow translates to reduced fatigue, improved endurance, and improved recovery times. Each serving of Nitric Oxide Booster contains a blend of key ingredients, including L-arginine and L-citrulline, which work together to increase vasodilation and muscle pump. Unfortunately, each ingredient is included in very small amounts. Each serving provides just 1,500mg of arginine and 750mg of L-citrulline in various forms, earning its formulation a 2.5 out of 5 score in my book. My thinking is, if you’re going to invest in a supplement and trust it in your system, you want it to be backed by science. [Related: Best Citrulline Supplements ] Each bottle of capsules contains 60 servings, or a two-month supply, of nitric oxide boosters for $19.95 or $0.33 per serving. While the minimal doses of each ingredient might be to thank for its extremely low price, we can’t help but praise the affordability that Nutricost offers in this product. Although more than one dose of a three-capsule serving doesn’t sound ideal, if you need to bump your intake with multiple doses, it’s still more affordable than many other nitric oxide supplements. Plus, even at such an affordable cost, Nutricost is able to send its Nitric Oxide Booster Capsules for third-party testing, giving you peace of mind when taking the supplement. Transparent Labs Bulk Black might be the answer if you want to streamline your pre-workout routine, as it acts as an all-in-one pre-workout and nitric oxide booster. With a hefty dose of citrulline malate combined with other ingredients designed to support vascular health and blood flow, Transparent Labs Bulk Black is no joke. Plus, each serving contains 275mg of caffeine, giving you a little pep in your step before you hit the gym. Compared to other pre-workout supplements, 275mg is a hefty dose of caffeine — roughly the same amount as three cups of coffee. Bulk Black may not be ideal if you’re sensitive to caffeine or prone to caffeine jitters. Bulk Black also provides research-backed doses of nitric oxide boosting compounds — 8g of citrulline malate and 4g of beta-alanine. These compounds earned Bulk Black a 4.5 out of 5 for its formulation, as research shows us that adequate doses of citrulline malate and beta-alanine are 6-8g and 4-6g, respectively. ( 10 ) Still, this is a pre-workout supplement , so it may not bring a good pump to everyone. Our tester felt like they could lift harder but didn’t notice any significant muscle pumps, giving it a 3 out of 5 for overall experience. “ I didn’t experience a pump, but I did notice tingles running up and down my arms for a good 30 to 45 minutes, ” they said. Each tub of Bulk Black comes with 30 servings for $54.99, or $1.83 per serving. While that’s on the higher end of what we like to see nitric oxide supplements sell for, you are getting a lot for your money. Plus, you can set up a delivery subscription for a $6 savings and free shipping. Bulk Black is offered in seven delicious flavors, including Cherry Kiwi, Blue Raspberry, Peach Mango, Sour Gummy, Black Cherry, Watermelon Peach, and Blueberry Pomegranate. Our tester tried Blue Raspberry and found the taste to be a little underwhelming, rating that flavor a 3 out of 5. “ It tastes a little watered down. I’d describe it more as a hint of blue raspberry. Maybe with less water, the flavor would be more potent ,” they say. “If you prefer pre-workouts that aren’t crazy sweet, this is the one for you,” they add. “It just has kind of a weird aftertaste.” Furthermore, there isn’t an unflavored option out of all those unique flavors. These creative flavors may not be conducive to mixing with other supplements or ingredients. Read our full Transparent Labs BulkBlack Review . But what about those who want to improve their blood flow before a workout without consuming copious amounts of caffeine? That’s where the best non-stim pre-workouts come into play, and we think Legion Pulse Caffeine-Free Pre-Workout is a good fit for the job. It contains a clinically-based dose of citrulline malate and no caffeine. Each 2-scoop serving contains a research-backed dose of 8 g of citrulline malate, higher than many competing nitric oxide supplements. Along with its positive effects on blood flow and muscle endurance, Legion Pulse can also improve strength, reduce fatigue, and increase power. Each scoop of Pulse contains beta-alanine, betaine anhydrous, and alpha-GPC. “Usually I go with pre-workouts with caffeine,” one of our testers says, rating its overall effects 4.5 out of 5. “I’ve always been skeptical of non-stim options, but not anymore. The beta-alanine in Pulse gives me the same pump as others with stimulants.” Of course, all these benefits don’t come cheap. Legion Pulse rivals Transparent Labs Bulk Black and Onnit Total Nitric Oxide for the most expensive nitric oxide supplement. Each container has 20 servings, costing $39.99 or $2 per serving. However, you can sign up for a delivery subscription for a small savings. Legion Pulse Caffeine-Free is available in eight unique flavors, including Arctic Blast, Blue Raspberry, Fruit Punch, Tropical Punch, Grape, Green Apple, Sour Candy, and Strawberry Kiwi. Unfortunately, there isn’t an unflavored option, so you have to be mindful about stacking supplement flavors. Another member of our team likes the seasonal pink lemonade flavor, giving it a 5 out of 5 for taste and stating, “ I wouldn’t call it sour at all, but it is sweet. I usually water it down a bit so the flavor isn’t overwhelming. ” Legion recommends mixing two scoops of this pre-workout in 8-12 ounces of water approximately 30 minutes before hitting the gym to get maximum results. Then, you can wait for the clinically dosed ingredients to do their thing. As far as solubility goes, our tester reports no issues. “ There weren’t any major clumps or noticeable grittiness after mixing, which was a huge plus for me. I hate a sludgy mixture at the bottom of the cup. ” Even without the caffeine, our tester noticed that their pump came with tingles, but nothing alarming. And for those of you reading this and wishing it did contain caffeine, you’re in luck! Legion offers its Pulse Pre-Workout in a caffeinated version that contains a whopping 350mg of caffeine. Just keep in mind that consuming 350mg of caffeine in your pre-workout is like drinking four cups of coffee before you hit the gym. Read our full Legion Pulse Review . Onnit Total Nitric Oxide caught our attention in our search for the best nitric oxide supplement for improving blood circulation. It’s packed with L-arginine nitrate and L-citrulline, two compounds linked to cardiovascular function. ( 6 ) Each serving provides 1.4 g of arginine nitrate and 3 g of L-citrulline, but its circulation support doesn’t stop there. It also contains Careflow Mango Fruit Powder, which has been linked to improved endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS) activity, a necessary pathway for blood circulation. ( 7 ) My only hesitation with the supplement’s ingredient list is its proprietary blend. Total Nitric Oxide contains a proprietary blend of beetroot, grape seed, apple, and acerola cherry extracts. While the extracts themselves aren’t alarming, I prefer to know exactly how much of each ingredient is in each serving. We give the formulation a 3.5 out of 5 score, plus one of our testers, a certified personal trainer, isn’t blown away by its effects. “I do feel a tiny bit more focused,” they say. “But without any stimulant, it’s struggles to help me get going for an early morning workout.” BarBend ‘s testers weren’t too thrilled with the flavor, either. “I use the Harvest Fruit flavor and the beet is very strong,” they say, rating the taste a 3 out of 5. “It tastes very natural, which I don’t mind but I think may not be the case for the average shopper.” Onnit recommends taking one scoop of their Total Nitric Oxide with 8 ounces of water up to twice daily, which may be less than convenient for some. Unfortunately, Onnit’s Nitric Oxide may be a budget buster compared to other nitric oxide boosters. When ordering as a one-time purchase, each tub costs $39.99. However, you can set up a delivery subscription for a 15 percent savings. At up to $2 per serving, it’s one of the most expensive options on this list, earning a 2 out of 5 score for its price per serving. Still, you get what you pay for as it’s third-party tested and Informed-Sport certified. Total Nitric Oxide boasts many purported benefits, including improved recovery, muscle-building support, reduced fatigue, and improved blood pressure. Our tester rates the overall effects a 3 out of 5, though. “I’d say I get a decent pump, but not much stronger or better than another standard pre-workout supplement,” they say. But if you’re in the business of stacking supplements, this nitric oxide boosting supplement can also be combined with Onnit’s Total Strength & Performance to further improve blood flow and skin-splitting pumps. Plus, while Onnit Total Nitric Oxide may be more expensive than its competition, it comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee. If it wasn’t a fit for you, simply reach out to Onnit’s customer service for a full refund.  In our search for the best nitric oxide supplements, we knew we needed to find something to fit the specific needs of our bodybuilder friends. Enter SNAP Supplements Nitric Oxide. This product has a natural, organic formula with zero artificial sweeteners or dyes, which is a bonus for bodybuilders looking to prepare for a competition. Each container comes with 30 servings. Additionally, each scoop provides organic beet root powder, organic pomegranate juice powder, and red spinach extract. This formula also packs a good amount of vital vitamins and minerals. One serving packs 100% of your daily vitamin B3 value, 416% of your daily vitamin B12 value, and 3% of your daily recommended potassium value. We like the simplicity of this formula, however, it isn’t the most budget-friendly. One 30-serving container costs $49.95, which is about $1.66 per serving. We had to give this product cost a 3 out of 5 rating, as there are definitely more budget-friendly products on this list. Though, you can subscribe to recurring deliveries and save 15%. Beetroot, with all its health benefits, has stepped into the spotlight and stolen the health and wellness show. Researchers have linked beetroot supplementation with improved markers for athletic performance, but its claim to fame continues to be its effects on overall health. Beetroot is often called a functional food for its role in improving blood lipids, blood glucose levels, and, our favorite, blood pressure. ( 5 ) And since KOS Organic Beet Root Powder contains organic beetroot powder and only organic beetroot powder, it earns our pick for the best nitric oxide supplement for blood pressure. In my work as a dietitian, I like to prioritize whole foods first and then turn to supplements to bridge the gap between your nutritional needs and your dietary intake. Typically, the best nitric oxide foods are a great option because it’s rare to find a supplement that takes the same approach — but KOS hit the nail on the head in that regard. KOS kept this product simple, with only one ingredient — USDA organic beetroot powder. However, it’s unclear how much beetroot powder is actually in each serving, so we gave KOS Organic Beet Root Powder a 4 out of 5 for its formulation. And if you want your nitric oxide supplement to multitask, you may need to try another option on the list with more active ingredients. Just one scoop of this organic, non-GMO, nitrate-rich beetroot supplement can improve blood pressure through its effects on vasodilation. With improved vasodilation comes decreased diastolic blood pressure. ( 5 ) Thanks to the beetroot, each scoop of this powder contains about 15 calories, 4 grams (g) of carbohydrates, and no protein or fat. Plus, it can be added to your favorite dish or beverage, making it convenient to incorporate a nitric oxide booster into your routine. You can snag a 90-serving container of this straightforward beet supplement for around $29.99 or approximately $0.33 per serving. As the most budget-friendly option on our list, it scored a 5 out of 5 for its price per serving. Unfortunately, that low price tag doesn’t allow for third-party testing — something to keep in mind if you’re a competitive athlete who undergoes drug testing.  There are many nitric oxide supplements out there, and while they boast impressive claims, very few have the science to back them up. Plus, the FDA doesn’t regulate sports nutrition supplements, adding another layer of mystery to your supplement choices. No need to worry because we’ve got you covered. Our testing team put dozens of nitric oxide supplements to the test, scoring them against BarBend ’s supplement testing methodology . The team, comprised of certified personal trainers, elite-level athletes, coaches, and registered dietitians, leaned into their professional judgments and personal experiences to provide you with as much information as possible to make an informed shopping decision. The testing team considered various factors, with a strong emphasis on the following: Taking one of these supplements can have several benefits when included in a well-rounded lifestyle. The most notable benefit of BCAAs is its influence on vasodilation. Nitric oxide can widen blood vessels, allowing for better blood flow and achieving the ever-desired “pump” at the gym. However, the benefits don’t stop there. Nitric oxide has also been connected to improved cardiovascular health through its role in circulation, heartbeat regulation, and nutrient delivery to the muscles. ( 11 ) Of course, however, it’s my duty as a registered dietitian to emphasize that you don’t need a nitric oxide supplement to see these benefits. A well-balanced diet, regular exercise, hydration, and optimal sleep can offer the same effects over time. As far as supplements go, nitric oxide supplements are generally inexpensive. When calculating cost, it’s better to look at the price per serving rather than the overall cost of the container. To do this, you’ll need to consider both the number of servings you’re getting and the overall cost of the product. Nitric oxide supplements come in various forms and contain an equal variety of ingredients. Before choosing your perfect pick, ensure you know exactly what you want from your supplement. Nitric Oxide supplements come in both pill and powder form. Neither is totally inconvenient, but pills are definitely the most convenient of the two, as you can easily throw a bottle in your bag, head out the door, and take a couple any time that works for you. However, pills tend to digest slower than powder since your body has to break through the capsule. Therefore, if you’re looking for the nitric oxide supplement to kick in right away, a powder that you mix with liquid to consume directly is a better choice. Neither is more effective than the other overall — it’s all about your personal preferences and priorities. Powder formulas lend enjoyability as a factor. If you enjoy tasty beverages or want to stay hydrated while working out , a powder formula can be a great way to do that. It’s also possible to find an unflavored powder to stack with your other supplements, which can help ensure you’re taking the supplements you want with the most ease. When determining which nitric oxide supplement to choose, it’s wise to understand how much of each amino acid or other ingredient combinations are used. “L-citrulline and beetroot extract are the two big ingredients to look for. Citrulline gets converted to arginine in the body, which then boosts nitric oxide. It’s often more effective than taking arginine directly, since it’s better absorbed. Beetroot works through a different pathway, using dietary nitrates to raise nitric oxide levels,” says Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. Each choice on our list has a different dosage for each amino acid. Some have very slim ingredient lists, while others are rather extensive. Still, both offer their own benefits. Before you choose which nitric oxide to buy, make sure you know what ingredients and combinations of ingredients you want in your supplement so you are not overpaying for a more robust ingredient list than you need. Nitric oxide supplements are not for everyone. Consult a medical professional before adding a nitric oxide supplement to your routine. If you decide to use a nitric oxide-boosting supplement, start slowly, as different compounds can affect some people differently. Instead of going straight for a full dose, it may be wise to start with a half dose and see how you feel. A medical doctor can help you make the right decision for your body. Although many great products on the market may enhance nitric oxide production, we believe that Transparent Labs Nitric Oxide is the best nitric oxide supplement. It contains three ingredients that can support nitric oxide production, as well as AstraGin and vitamin C, which may make these ingredients more accessible to absorb. While no foods contain nitric oxide, some contain nitrates that may help boost nitric oxide levels. Beets are among the most well-researched foods that may lead to higher nitric oxide levels. As with just about any supplement, different people can expect different side effects. Most common with Nitric Oxide, you may experience GI issues, headaches, or allergic reactions. However, this isn’t common for the majority. That being said, if you are taking other medications or have any preexisting conditions, it’s best to consult your doctor before you start taking this supplement.

    "text": "Let’s set the record straight: There’s no gender bias when it comes to choosing the best protein powder for your needs. That said, studies indicate that men typically require a higher intake of protein (especially if they train regularly). ( 1 ) Because men generally have more body mass and a higher weight, they require more energy overall, including more of each macronutrient. However, the evidence does not support gender differences in overall macronutrient ratios. The best protein powders for men can help male-identifying athletes hit their daily protein goals while also assisting in building muscle, maintaining satiety, and developing lean muscle mass. To choose the best ones, we’ve drawn upon decades of peer-reviewed scientific literature, input from registered dietitians, and our personal testing experiences with more than 100 of the top options on the market. Using our supplement testing methodology, we’ve rated and examined top-performing powders in categories such as: The BarBend team has helped connect over 1.6 million athletes with high-quality dietary supplements to help fuel their performance and fitness progress. If you’re in need of a new protein powder to supplement your daily health, we’re confident that the following details can help place you on the right path. Our best protein powder for men of 2025 is Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate . We love this product for its clean ingredients, high protein count, and wide (and delicious) flavor variety. Read on to learn all of our best protein powders for men. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Join BarBend expert reviewer Jake Herod, NASM-CNC, and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, as they detail our picks for the best protein powders for men, which include options for digestion, weight loss, and muscle gain. For male athletes wanting the best of the best, we hold Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate in high regard. We appreciate the 28 grams of protein per serving — a higher dosage than your typical 20 to 25 grams — as well as this powder’s abundance of flavors. As one BarBend tester, a certified personal trainer, explains, there’s a reason it’s our top pick. “This is, without question, one of the best protein powders I’ve had in recent memory,” they say. “You get the satiety you want from a mixed shake, there aren’t any negative side effects post-consumption, and the flavors are impeccable. I’d recommend this powder to anyone looking to switch up their supplement regimen. It’s a clear staple in my routine now .” In addition to being one of the best whey protein powders we’ve tried, this particular protein powder is great for men because of its key micronutrients, including calcium, iron, and potassium. Dosages can vary by flavor, but the inclusion of potassium is especially beneficial, as some research suggests potassium may help maintain lean muscle mass and help to prevent cardiovascular disease. ( 3 )( 4 ) Thanks to these key ingredients, as well as the hearty dose of whey protein isolate in each serving, we rate this Transparent Labs a 5 out of 5 for formulation complexity. “I love that Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is free from artificial sweeteners , food dyes, and preservatives . You get 28 grams of high-quality protein without any unnecessary fluff,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. “I got my hands on a limited-edition flavor — Peppermint Hot Chocolate,” our tester says, scoring its taste 5 out of 5. “While there wasn’t as much peppermint as I’d hoped, I was pleased with its mouthfeel and taste. All I needed were some mini marshmallows to complete the scene.” Be mindful, though, that the makeup does include stevia, which can lead to side effects like bloat or GI distress. ( 2 )( 5 ) We personally haven’t experienced any issues, but more sensitive athletes could potentially run a risk, so it’s important to take your personal sensitivities into account before purchase. If you’re worried about stevia or other sweeteners, try an unflavored protein powder from Nutricost or Legion. Like other Transparent Labs products, Whey Protein Isolate is third-party tested, meaning it’s free of any banned substances. There are also no artificial sweeteners, preservatives, or colorings across the makeup, and the powder is non-GMO and gluten-free. Mixing Transparent Labs Whey Isolate is also a breeze, earning the powder another 5 out of 5 rating for solubility. “There weren’t any issues during blending,” says our tester. “I could easily make a shake with water and milk, alike.” The one main drawback to this high-quality protein supplement is its cost, which we rate at 3.5 out of 5 for multiple reasons. First, the $2 per serving is higher than most other options, which typically come in between $1 and $1.75. For a more budget-friendly alternative, give Nutricost Whey Protein Concentrate a try. Good for: Anyone looking for a third-party-tested product with a variety of flavors and higher protein content than other brands. Read our full Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate Review . If you’re looking for a tasty treat that feels more like a snack than a nutritional supplement, XWERKS Grow is the powder for you. We’ve previously called this product one of the best-tasting protein powders available — and for good reason. Across the four available flavors, we’ve yet to find a blend that doesn’t deliver a palate-pleasing experience. According to our tester, a certified personal trainer, “The Chocolate variety tastes nearly identical to a Yoo-Hoo. I really appreciate the mix of sweet and richness.” Also, they paired their 5-out-of-5 taste rating with a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “Mixing was rarely an issue. I practically didn’t need a blender ball to break up any clumps.” Another BarBend tester, Wes Stroud, says that the thick texture only adds to the Vanilla option. “The texture is great in water, but I usually use milk with the Vanilla flavor,” he says. “There is a tiny aftertaste, but I still give this flavor a 4 out of 5. It’s more foamy than average, but no clumps or anything.” While taste is a major factor when it comes to XWERKS Grow, the formulation is also worthwhile thanks to protein dosages ranging from 25.8 to 27.8 grams per serving, depending on your chosen flavor. XWERKS  sources its whey protein isolate from New Zealand grass-fed cows. These animals are highly regulated to ensure they’re raised with no exposure to hormones, pesticides, or antibiotics. ( 6 ) You can also expect 110 calories per serving with this protein powder, which can be viewed in multiple ways. That may not be a suitable amount for athletes wanting a full-blown meal replacement shake , but it can be enough to keep you satiated in between meals. Also, you get 110 calories regardless of your chosen flavor, which can make planning around your daily nutritional goals more feasible. XWERKS Grow’s makeup also includes over 6 grams of BCAAs, which studies show can help support muscle recovery and assist in limiting post-workout soreness. ( 7 ) Unfortunately, though, information on dosages isn’t present on the physical packaging, which can lead to confusion. XWERKS does list the complete amino acid profile online, but it’s an added step if you’re looking to research the formulation. Granted, other protein powders may offer more unique tastes across a larger flavor roster. What this protein powder lacks in flavor variety, though, it makes up for in quality … if you’re willing to pay. According to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD, “At around $2 per serving, XWERKS Grow is one of the more expensive options on the market. Still, you get 25 grams of protein for $2, so it’s not too outrageous.” For more flavor options, you can try Legion Whey+. Good for: Those looking for a low-calorie option with 25-plus grams of protein. Read our full XWERKS Grow Review . We recommend Jacked Factory’s Authentic ISO protein powder for male athletes because of its impressive 25 grams of whey protein isolate. This form of protein is filtered for a more refined end product, which helps eliminate unwanted lactose, fat, fillers, or carbs. This leaner formulation, which we rated at a 4.5 out of 5, can be excellent for athletes looking to fine-tune their daily macros without sacrificing other areas throughout their meal plan. Plus, the 25 grams is a high protein dosage when compared to other powders out there — typically 24 grams or lower. “The Vanilla flavor is really good. I appreciate that it’s not overly sweet because some protein powders overdo it,” says BarBend tester Sam Hall, who scores both its taste and solubility at 4 out of 5. “I prefer mixing it with milk over water, but neither allow for any clumps or grittiness.” We also like how Jacked Factory keeps costs relatively low when it comes to Authentic ISO. We rated the cost per serving at 5 out of 5, as the starting $0.93 per dosage is below the average $1 to $1.75 we’ve seen in other high-quality protein powders. There is only one container size, though, which may deter some men who prefer to buy their protein powder in bulk quantities. For bulk containers of 60 or more servings, check out options like Nutricost Whey Protein Concentrate or Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein. When it comes to flavors, this milk protein supplement has eight to choose from. Reviews are (understandably) mixed, although we’ve found the tastes to be enjoyable enough for repeat sips and shakes throughout the week. “If you’re prone to getting bored with your protein powder flavors, you’ll likely be excited about Jacked Factory’s dessert-inspired options,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. Be mindful, though, that Authentic ISO is sweetened with sucralose and stevia. These sweetening agents could potentially cause GI distress and other side effects in more sensitive individuals. ( 2 )( 5 ) If it fits your budget, go with Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate for an option without sucralose. Hall adds that he tends to just finish his shakes right away. “If you let it sit too long, it will start to separate,” he says. “But there’s nothing dramatic like the nasty sludge I’ve seen from some protein powders.” Good for: Anyone looking for a range of flavors from their protein powder. There are many different types of protein out there, including casein. Casein protein digests more slowly than whey, making it an ideal choice for maintaining satiety throughout the day or keeping your muscles fueled throughout the evening. ( 9 ) Transparent Labs Casein is our top pick for this category, partly due to a clean makeup that’s free of any artificial preservatives, sweeteners, or colorings. “I’m a fan of the macro breakdown that Transparent Labs offers with their Casein Protein powder,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD, who rated the formulation at 4.75 out of 5. “You get a whopping 25 grams of protein without an overwhelming amount of carbs or fat. It helps you meet your protein needs without overdoing it in other areas.” BarBend editorial member and certified personal trainer Rosie Borchert highlights how well it blends and scores its solubility 4.5 out of 5. “Unlike some other popular protein powders, which can sometimes leave a ton of product that settles to the bottom of your drink, this powder stayed smooth from the first sip until the last,” she says. Yes, you’re limited to just classic Vanilla or Chocolate flavors, but one BarBend tester, a certified personal trainer, gave this powder a 5 out of 5 for taste. “I really like adding this protein to less liquid than usual. It creates a pudding-like consistency that reminds you of a Snack Pack you’d enjoy back in grade school.” Borchert also experimented with adding Transparent Labs Casein to other dishes. “I did mix up a high-protein tofu pudding with it, which was fab-u-lous! I could eat this stuff every night.” Like other Transparent Labs products, you do need to pay a premium to take advantage of this well-designed supplement. At $2 per serving, it’s higher than the average $1 to $1.75 price tag you’ll find with other protein powders. Additionally, this supplement is only available in 30-serving containers, leaving no opportunity to buy in bulk for a cheaper price. For a less expensive casein, try out Naked Nutrition Casein Protein. Still, though, for staving off those late-night cravings and keeping your muscles full throughout the night, it’s hard to find a better solution than this tasty treat. “For only having 120 calories, I’m surprised how full I feel once I finish,” our tester adds. Good for: Those who work out late at night and need a high-quality protein option before bed. Read our full Transparent Labs Casein Protein Review . Want to give protein a permanent spot in your supplement routine but don’t want to shell out your life savings? Check out Nutricost Whey Protein Concentrate. The average whey protein supplement tends to cost somewhere between $1 and $2 per serving, but this Nutricost profile costs less than $0.90 per dose. It’s also available in 2- and 5-pound containers — as any Costco or Amazon devotee knows, buying in bulk can save you some serious cash in the long run (great news if you’re bulking on a budget ). The macros of this supplement are solid, too. In each serving, you get 25 grams of protein, 3 to 3.5 grams of fat, 1 to 3 grams of carbs, and 130 to 150 calories, depending on the flavor. This helps earn it a 4 out of 5 for formulation. “It still provides more carbs and fat than your average isolate powder, but it does a good job of prioritizing protein over the other macros,” notes Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. We mostly love the taste, though. Kate Meier, BarBend editorial member and NASM-Certified Personal Trainer, scores the category a 4 out of 5, dinging it slightly for having just four flavors. (For more flavor options, try protein from Legion or Transparent Labs.) “I’m traditionally not a fan of peanut butter, but this protein powder actually had me enjoying every sip,” she says of the Chocolate Peanut Butter variety. “It’s not overly sweet, and I had no issues getting a shake down each and every day. Also, my partner has stomach issues with some protein powders, but didn’t with this one.” (It’s important to note that this powder does contain sucralose as an artificial sweetener, which may cause digestive issues in some people.) Meier also scored this powder’s solubility and texture both 5 out of 5, noting that while it tasted great when mixed with water or milk. “Oh my gosh. In milk, the texture is absolutely amazing. Creamy like a melted milkshake,” she raves. “ Also, not a single clump at the bottom of my shaker cup,” she added. Good for: Those looking for a cost-effective protein powder that still delivers a high-quality muscle-building product. Gainful Plant-Based Protein Powder offers 23 grams of organic brown rice and pea protein, which delivers a complete amino acid profile. Plus, available flavor packs help craft a unique menu across your weekly supplement schedule. For men following a vegan diet, there are a variety of the best vegan protein powders to choose from. We recommend Gainful Everyday Plant Protein given its versatility in terms of taste. Rather than one container of a singular flavor, Gainful’s Everyday Plant Protein comes in an unflavored base powder that can be enhanced through different flavor packs (of which there are a ton). “I chose Chocolate Peanut Butter and Cafe Mocha , both of which are delightful,” says vegan BarBend editorial member and certified personal trainer, Alex Polish. Both flavors earn a 4.5 out of 5 from them. “The mocha flavor doesn’t quite give me the coffee-esque vibe that I want, but it’s still very pleasant. It’s even strong enough to completely mask some pretty grassy greens powder when I tossed all of the above into a blender with a banana and some oat milk.” “I really like that Gainful offers a personalized protein powder formula and that it’s unsweetened and free from artificial ingredients,” says our expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. She rated its formulation 4.5 out of 5, in part because Gainful uses both brown rice protein and pea protein to deliver up to 23 grams of total protein. This plant-based protein blend also helps Gainful Everyday Plant Protein create a complete amino acid profile — a common flaw in other vegan protein powders. ( 22 ) It is also low in calories (120 per serving), which may be important for some people, especially if they are not relying on it as a meal replacement shake. That said, the low calories could be an issue for people looking to gain more muscle or utilize the shake as a real meal replacement option. “Oat milk plus this powder works gorgeously. It tastes like a milkshake and feels like one, too,” Polish says, rating its solubility and texture at 4 out of 5. “Yeah, it’s got a couple of clumps, but so do great milk shakes, so I can’t count that against it. In water, it thickens up pretty decently, too. But, if you’re going to use only water, I’d recommend using less than you would of milk.” Gainful Vegan Protein is more expensive than other proteins we’ve tested, coming in at roughly $2.57 per serving. “I don’t love the price point, especially because there are so few servings per bag,” Polish says. “But if getting supps that feel customized is your thing, I understand the added allure.” If you’re looking for a less expensive vegan option, try Orgain Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder. Good for: Anyone with dietary restrictions or those following a vegan diet who are looking for a complete amino acid profile. Read our full Gainful Protein Powder Review . Yes, when it comes to the benefits of protein , there’s no shortage. However, when most men start supplementing with these powders, it’s likely to take advantage of protein’s effects on muscle protein synthesis. ( 10 ) For these particular fitness goals, we recommend Onnit’s Grass-Fed Whey Protein because of its reliance on whey protein isolate — a leaner protein type that delivers 20 grams of the macronutrient without excessive fat, lactose, or carbs. You still get between 2 and 2.5 grams of fat and between 3 and 4 grams of carbohydrates with each dosage, but the emphasis on protein is why this powder serves as our pick for gaining muscle. “I like the macronutrient ratio that Onnit Whey Protein provides — 20 grams of protein , around 2 grams of fat, and 3-4 grams of carbs . And I like that Onnit includes an enzyme blend in their ingredients to help promote good digestion,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. We rate the formulation a 4.5 out of 5, too, because of the complete amino acid profile used in the makeup. This component can be excellent for helping you maintain that resistance training schedule — muscle gain is half-diet, half-effort, after all — as BCAAs and EAAs can assist with muscle recovery and relief from soreness post-workout. ( 7 ) One tester, a certified personal trainer, highlights how well it mixes in a standard shaker bottle. “The solubility is great, and the powder practically disappears when mixed in water. I find no clumps whatsoever every time I mix it up.” BarBend tester Taylor Truitt, however, senses some grit, leading to our 4-out-of-5 solubility rating. “I don’t get visible clumps, but there is still some grittiness to it. I’d just recommend shaking for longer than 10 seconds in order to ensure a smooth consistency.” When it comes to taste, you are limited to just Vanilla or Mexican Chocolate, which may be to the dismay of flavor-adventurous athletes. Additionally, our tester notes that the palate profile is somewhat thin, leading to a 3.75-out-of-5 rating for the category. “I enjoy the flavor, but this shake is so thin that you almost lose a chunk of the taste because it mixes so well,” they add. “I’d be willing to sacrifice some solubility if it meant regaining some richness in the powder.” For more flavor options, try out protein powders by Legion or Optimum Nutrition. Onnit Grass-Fed Whey Protein is on the higher end when looking at the cost per serving. $2 per scoop is more than the average $1 to $1.75 cost of other high-quality protein powders. For those wanting to beef up with a powder that’s no bull, though, we believe it’s worth the investment. Good for: People looking for an easily digestible whey protein that packs in a complete amino acid profile. Read our full Onnit Grass-Fed Whey Protein Review . Legion’s Plant+ has 25 grams of protein per serving, just four grams of carbs, and is packed with vitamins and minerals that plant-based eaters may want more of. Whey is often the first protein that comes to mind when one thinks of protein supplements. As one of the best whey isolates on the market, Legion’s Whey+ is a worthwhile pick for a slew of needs. Depending on the flavor, you can expect a hearty 21 to 23 grams of whey protein isolate per serving, along with a formulation that’s free of added sugars, lactose, GMOs, or, as the brand states, “artificial junk.” “The first thing I look for in a protein powder is artificial sweeteners ,” says BarBend editorial member Matt Cummings. “Some people don’t like anything with stevia, but whatever they do to make this Chocolate is working. I’m about to finish a five-pound bag of this stuff and I couldn’t be happier with it.” “Legion products focus on research-backed nutrition, and their Whey+ protein powder is no exception. Whey+ is clinically dosed to support muscle building and workout recovery,” states Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. The 5.6 grams of BCAAs per dosage can also be excellent for helping men improve their post-workout recovery time while also assisting with any lingering muscle soreness. ( 7 ) Both Cummings and another BarBend tester, a certified personal trainer, score Whey+ at 4.5 out of 5 for taste and highlight the flavor options on tap. “The flavor matches the taste listed on the packaging, but it’s not overly pungent. I tested the Cinnamon Cereal variety, and I’d equate it to drinking the milk of a certain breakfast treat.” “I’ve mixed this in water and milk, but I typically shake it up with cold brew coffee (which is mostly water, anyways) in the mornings,” Cummings adds, rating its solubility at 5 out of 5. “It blends up way better than most other protein powders I’ve used.” We also caution athletes to be mindful of their container size when placing an order. On the surface, Whey+ is fairly affordable with costs per serving starting at $1.46. That price tag can quickly jump beyond the $1 to $1.75 average, though, if you opt for a smaller tub. Still, the price is reasonable enough to earn Whey+ a 4 out of 5 for cost. For more bulk options, try out Nutricost Whey Concentrate. Neither of our team members noted any unwanted side effects or GI distress during our trials, but it’s worth noting that there aren’t any digestive enzymes present in the formula. This means that men with more sensitive stomachs risk some moans and groans when adding this protein to their regimen, although likely less so than with whey protein concentrates. Take your personal sensitivities into consideration before going full bore into this high-quality whey protein isolate. Good for: Anyone looking to try a wide variety of flavors without sacrificing a high-quality nutrition profile. Read our full Legion Whey+ Protein Review . Following a clean, organic diet but struggling to find a supp that can deliver on your protein goals? Ritual’s Essential Daily Shake packs in 20 grams of organic, non-GMO pea protein into each serving, which can greatly assist your nutritional regimen as you search for solutions between meals. Plus, Ritual adds in 400 milligrams of l-methionine for a complete amino acid profile — a rarity amongst plant-based protein options. ( 22 ) “ While plant-based proteins are becoming increasingly available, it is necessary to ensure the blend provides a complete amino acid profile, in order to get the most benefit out of your supplement ,” says Dr. Jennie Stanford, M.D., FAAFP, DipABOM. We also admire how Ritual details every ingredient and step of its manufacturing process. We rate this protein powder a 5 out of 5 for third-party testing due to its Clean Label Project certification, as well as the fact that, like Ritual Essential Multivitamin (among other offerings), every element of the formulation can be traced directly back to its source. “I’m a huge fan of companies that are transparent with their formulas, and Ritual’s got that down to a science,” notes Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. “Essential Protein Daily Shake is third-party tested and made with traceable ingredients, so you know exactly what you’re putting in your body and where it came from.” Additionally, Kate Meier, BarBend editorial member and NASM-Certified Personal Trainer, gives Daily Shake a 4 out of 5 for taste. “It’s not super ‘planty’ like other vegan proteins I’ve tried in the past,” she says. “I do notice a slightly chalky aftertaste when mixing the powder in water, but I wouldn’t say it deterred me from drinking a shake regularly.” BarBend tester Sam Hall also praises how quickly it mixes up. “It’s easy to just mix up in a shaker cup and barely even takes 10 seconds,” he says, scoring its solubility at 4 out of 5. “I also just love not having to contend with any sticking to the sides or little clumps floating around.” We did not, however, have similarly positive experiences when looking at the cost and value of this protein powder, which we rated at 2 out of 5 on our scale. $2.67 per serving is far beyond the average $1 to $1.75 range we’ve seen in other protein supplements. Plus, there’s a single container size — 15 servings — meaning you’ll need to purchase multiple packages if you plan on supplementing with Daily Shake each day throughout a given month. For a more budget-friendly option, try out Nutricost, which also has a 5-pound bulk container. Finally, Ritual operates on a subscription-based strategy. When you make your initial purchase, you’re automatically signed up for repeat orders. While this could be viewed as a perk given the smaller container size, we understand that a new subscription isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. Good for: Those looking for a plant-based protein powder that has gone through open and transparent third-party testing. Disclaimer: Please note that none of these products describe themselves as weight loss supplements and should not be taken as such. Please consult with a medical professional before beginning any weight loss protocol. To lose weight, you need to achieve and maintain a calorie deficit , i.e., burning more energy than you consume. ( 12 ) However, not all calories are created equal, and protein can be an excellent tool in achieving this thanks to its ability to keep you full in-between whole meals while also promoting thermogenesis — the process by which your body burns calories. ( 13 ) For men focused on weight loss, we recommend Momentous Grass Fed Whey Protein thanks to its low-calorie makeup of 90 to 100 calories per serving, as well as its inclusion of other micronutrients. Depending on your flavor of choice — Unflavored, Chocolate, or Vanilla — you can expect to consume between 110 and 260 milligrams of potassium in one Momentous shake. According to studies, potassium can be a helpful micronutrient for men thanks to its ability to promote lean muscle mass. ( 3 ) Potassium can also be a good defense against heart-related illnesses, which are reportedly more common amongst the male population. ( 4 ) ( 14 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD, also praised the formulation of Momentous Grass-Fed Whey Protein, rating it at 4.25 out of 5. “I might be a little biased, but I love that Momentous collaborates with dietitians when formulating their products and I love love love that they link up-to-date research that backs their product’s ingredients,” she states. Formulation aside, Kate Meier, NASM-CPT, USAW-L1, CF-L1, also rates this protein powder highly at 4 out of 5 for taste. “I had Chocolate during our trials and found it rich in flavor, almost like hot cocoa,” she says. “I’d purchase this again solely because of taste.” Meanwhile, BarBend editorial member Matt Cummings appreciates the subtlety of the Vanilla option. “I could barely taste the vanilla in both bases, but that’s a good thing. I can’t stand the overly-sweet protein powders,” he says. “Whether I use milk or water, it’s pretty frothy and feels a bit heavy, but its thickness contributed to the texture.” Meier and Cummings both rate Momentous Grass-Fed Whey Protein at 5 out of 5 for solubility, noting zero instances of clumping or residue buildup. “I even doubled the dosage for a thicker, heavier shake and still achieved a smooth consistency,” Meier says. We didn’t experience any present side effects or stomach issues when testing this as one of the best protein powders for weight loss , but other athletes have noted cases of bloat and GI distress. Before ordering a container for yourself, it’s always wise to take your personal sensitivities into account. Finally, while Momentous Grass Fed Whey Protein is one of our favorite protein supplements for men, we understand that the $2.70 cost per serving isn’t for every budget. It’s nearly a whole dollar more than the average range we see in high-quality proteins, which may price some athletes out of the mix. For those looking for a premium supplement to give their weight loss journey an added zest of flavor and performance, though, we think it’s worth the higher price tag. If you can’t swallow the price, though, try a more affordable option from Jacked Factory or Nutricost. Good for: People looking for a low-calorie protein option that still packs a ton of flavor. Read our full Momentous Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate Review . The BarBend team is made up of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. For this guide, we gathered our testing notes from 104 different protein powders, narrowing down our findings to the best formulations specifically for male athletes. Using our BarBend ‘s supplement testing methodology, we gave each chosen protein powder a rating between 1 (lowest) and 5 (highest) for categories such as ingredients, taste, solubility, side effects, and more. Below are some additional details on how we came to our ratings and conclusions for each tested protein powder. Since men tend to have bigger bodies and more muscle mass than women, they require more protein in their diets than women do. This goes doubly for men who work out, which is probably why male customers account for 70% of all protein supplements sold. ( 15 ) Besides being a nutritional requirement, supplementing with protein powders has plenty of additional benefits, including satiety, muscle growth, and convenience. Sometimes, it seems like you need a degree in advanced chemistry to know the difference between the types of protein out there. Is there a best type of protein powder for men? Not really … it ultimately depends on your fitness goals, plus any dietary needs or restrictions you might have. Here’s a quick primer on the types of protein available to help you tell your isolates from your hydrolysates. Whey is derived from milk during the cheesemaking process. Because whey protein is liquid in its natural form, it’s absorbed in the body faster than other protein powders, making it great for a post-workout shake. There are three types of whey protein — whey concentrate, isolate, and hydrolysate : Like whey, casein is a protein found in milk, but unlike whey, it forms a gel when it contacts stomach acid, which slows down its absorption into your bloodstream. This can be beneficial for men who are cutting and want to stay satiated longer. It can also be ideal for men who are trying to put on muscle mass. Taking a scoop of casein before bed can deliver a slow, steady drip of protein while you sleep, which is when the majority of muscle building occurs. ( 12 )( 19 )( 20 ) If you want to go with a casein protein, check out our recommendations for the best casein protein powders . Pea Protein is a great option for men who avoid animal products or those following a more restricted diet plan, such as veganism. Often, you’ll find it blended with other sources of plant protein like quinoa, pumpkin seed protein, and brown rice protein. ( 22 ) Speaking of other plant proteins, you can find additional plant protein powders on the market sourced from soy, hemp, or chia seed. Like the name suggests, egg protein is derived from eggs. It can be a good alternative to whey and casein if you can’t drink dairy. Be warned, though — egg protein powder often has a less-than-desirable taste and smell to it, making it more suited for cooking-based recipes rather than a standalone beverage. As we’ve said before, there are a lot of types of protein powder available, but dialing in the best one for men depends greatly on the individual. When you’re shopping for protein powder, consider factors like protein content, dietary restrictions, and taste preference. A good portion of protein powders come from milk, so if you’re sensitive or intolerant to lactose, you may want to tread carefully. If you have a sensitivity to milk, you may be able to get away with taking whey isolate, which has almost all of the lactose removed. If the thought of a bowl of ice cream sends you running to the nearest bathroom, however, you’re better off looking for a whey hydrolysate or plant-based protein powder. If you’re looking for more protein, you’re going to want to find a powder that serves at least 20 grams. Since most fall within the 20- to 25-gram range, it shouldn’t be difficult to find one that works for you. But make sure you read the nutritional information on whatever protein you’re considering, as some protein powders can contain as little as 10 to 15 grams per serving. It’s important to understand the different types of protein powders before making your purchase. For example, if you want a slow-digesting protein to take you through a long work day or help keep you full at night, you might want to go with a casein protein powder. This type of protein can support the muscle-building process while you sleep or during periods of fasting. If taste isn’t a factor, more power to you. But there’s nothing wrong with a protein powder that offers you a little treat in the middle of your day. In addition to the classic chocolate and vanilla offerings, keep an eye out for fun flavors like Cinnamon French Toast or Blueberry Muffin. After all, you’re more likely to drink a protein shake that you like than one that you have to choke down. The reasons we all go to the gym vary; some want to lose weight, others want to gain muscle or strength, and even then, some of us just enjoy the routine. Protein powder can certainly help you achieve your fitness goals, but the formulation of one protein powder may help better than others. For example, if your goal is to lose some fat while maintaining muscle mass, a lower-calorie whey isolate might be a good choice. However, for building muscle, you may want a higher protein and calorie content. The FDA doesn’t closely regulate what ingredients are in a supplement, so you’ll want to look for brands that present plenty of transparency with their ingredients. The most reputable brands will clearly state when products have undergone third-party testing to ensure that they are safe, effective, and free from banned substances. Look for third-party tested certifications from Informed Choice, Informed Sport, or others on a product’s packaging. There are plenty of protein powders on the market today — but they’re not all equal. Some may have filler ingredients, added sugars, or just some components you may want to avoid. Here are some ingredients to be aware of, and always check the nutrition and ingredients label to ensure you’re not ingesting anything you’re actually wanting to avoid. We’ve covered this already in this article, but it doesn’t hurt to reiterate: Be mindful of the type of protein you’re consuming in your protein powder. Some people may need to pay attention to the protein source, due to dietary restrictions or allergies. People who follow a vegan lifestyle, or who have a dairy allergy, will need to steer clear of whey and casein, as well. At the same time, many plant proteins lack all nine essential amino acids, making them incomplete proteins. Look for plant protein blends so that you ensure getting all your essential aminos in your protein drink. To help with flavor and taste, many protein powders have added sweeteners within their respective makeups. People who are watching their sugar intake may want to avoid protein powders with added sugars, and opt, instead, for a natural sweetener like stevia or monk fruit. Another that some may want to avoid are artificial sweeteners like sucralose, which can cause gastrointestinal distress in some people. ( 2 ) Several reviews and studies have found that protein powders can contain elevated amounts of heavy metals. ( 23 ) Heavy metal toxicity has been shown to have an adverse effect on human metabolic processes, which can increase the risk of various diseases. ( 24 ) Because of this, many consider it vital to take protein powder that has been third-party tested for purity. This will help minimize the risk of ingesting dangerous amounts of heavy metals. Third-party testing is an added bonus for athletes, as it can help ensure that the protein powder is free from any banned substances or other contaminants. While not in every protein powder, caffeine can be found in certain flavors — particularly coffee, cappuccino, or mocha flavors. If you have a sensitivity to caffeine, or if you’d rather not get an energy jolt from your protein shake, you may want to opt for a more traditional Vanilla or Chocolate flavor. The perfect protein powder varies from person to person, but for our money, the best is Transparent Labs Whey Protein Powder thanks to its easy digestion and hefty 28-gram dose of protein per serving. We also appreciate that the formulation contains 130 milligrams of potassium, which may help men maintain lean muscle mass. ( 3 ) One or two protein shakes a day can be good for both men and women. It can help increase muscle strength and size when paired with exercise — plus, it can help you retain muscle mass in a caloric deficit. Additionally, protein powder can help increase feelings of satiety, which can help keep you from overeating throughout the day. No, men do not need different protein powder than women. ( 1 ) The biggest difference, however, is the amount of protein men need when compared to women. This is because men generally tend to weigh more than women. That said, the ratio of protein that men and women need relative to their body weight is the same. Leucine is one of the three essential branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs ), with the others being isoleucine and valine. BCAAs are commonly referred to as the building blocks of protein and have been shown to help increase muscle mass. ( 7 ) Leucine content is important when purchasing a protein powder, so be sure to look for a brand that contains a complete amino acid profile.

    "text": "A hearty protein powder can help you hit your protein goals, but making a protein shake or toting around a shaker bottle isn’t always feasible. Protein bars are worthwhile alternatives for those needing a quick fix of muscle-boosting macros. Additionally, the best protein bars can be your secret weapon for consuming sufficient amino acids for muscle growth and keeping hunger at bay between meals. Take a look online, at your local supplements store, or even at the gas station, however, and you’ll soon realize that there’s practically no end to the assortment of protein bars available to athletes. To narrow down your search efforts, we took a deep dive into the category by personally testing 46 different bars, conducting mounds of research, and pouring over customer reviews. After weeks of testing (and plenty of wrappers discarded) we’ve landed on the best protein bars available today. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Check out our best protein bars round-up video for an up-close and personal look at some of the picks on our list. BarBend ‘s Nick English walks you through the makeups of our favorite macro-rich snacks, offering some expert insight along the way on what you may like or dislike about them depending on your training goals and nutritional needs. Among our favorite protein bars, the Transparent Labs Protein+ Bar packs plenty of protein per serving and uses only grass-fed whey, alongside other clean ingredients. There are a few must-have factors we considered for the best protein bar: protein content, clean ingredients, and a delicious flavor. Transparent Labs Protein+ Bar ticks all those boxes and more. One bar packs 15 grams of grass-fed whey protein with no artificial sugars or flavors, earning the formula a 4.5 out of 5 rating. “I like the list of wholesome ingredients featured in Transparent Labs Grass-Fed Protein+ Bars,” says our expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “The deductions stem from the saturated fat and added sugar content.” Whereas many protein bars use sucralose or other artificial sugars as sweeteners, Transparent Labs includes honey and dates as sweetening agents. We also like that the macros are pretty balanced, including 16 grams of fat, 23 grams of carbs, and 15 grams of protein. “These bars genuinely taste like peanut butter and chocolate. The chocolate pieces melt in your mouth,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer, who rates the flavor a 4 out of 5. “Unlike some other protein bars, they don’t taste chalky. I’m not a huge protein bar person, but I could totally foresee myself keeping these around for rushed days.” The texture is also a highlight, earning a matching 4 out of 5. “They’re a little bit dry, but the dates definitely helped make the bars soft and chewy,” our tester says. One downside, for some athletes, may be the fat content in these bars. Higher fat content isn’t necessarily a bad thing but it may not fit everyone’s dietary regimen. “These are pretty dense and they’re not low fat at all,” our tester says. “But the formula is clean, which is a big selling point for me.” Unfortunately, Transparent Labs’ protein bars aren’t the most budget-friendly pick on our list. One box of 12 bars costs $39.99, which is about $3.33 per bar. We gave this product a 3 out of 5 for cost, as most of our other picks cost less than $3 per bar. David Protein Bars are not only delicious but come in an array of must-try flavors, including Blueberry Pie and Fudge Brownie. These also pack more protein per serving (28 grams) than your average bar. Your protein snack should be enjoyable, so that you actually look forward to meeting your protein intake. David Protein Bars are almost scarily good, earning a 5 out of 5 in the flavor department. They also offer a good variety of flavor options, including Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, Fudge Brownie, Cake Batter, and Blueberry Pie. Our team was also pretty impressed with the amount of protein per serving, giving the formula a 4 out of 5 rating. These bars are 75% protein, packing 28 grams per serving, which is more than you’ll find with most others. However, we do wish they were third-party tested to better confirm that the label is totally accurate. Unlike other protein bars, however, this one certainly wasn’t the most budget-friendly we could fined. One box of 12 bars costs $39, which is about $3.25 per bar. We had to rate the cost a 3 out of 5 because athletes shopping on a budget can definitely find options under $3 per bar. We also like that the David Protein website closely spells out each ingredient and why they use it in their product. This transparency is definitely a plus, considering a lot of protein bars on the market can contain artificial ingredients, colors, and fillers. Legion High-Protein Bar has 20g of protein, 24g of carbs, and 12 grams of fat per bar. It slots in at 240 calories, and there’s only 4g of sugar per bar, which is pretty low considering some bars have up to 20g. Plus, the protein comes from a combination of whey protein isolate and whey protein concentrate, which makes for a balanced, stable blend. For athletes looking to gain muscle, we highly recommend Legion’s High-Protein Bar. Each bar comes with 20 grams of a protein blend containing whey isolate, whey hydrolysate, and whey concentrate, as well as 240 to 250 calories. That’s enough for a perfect post-workout supplement . The ingredients are clean, including 6 to 12 grams of fat, 24 to 38 grams of carbohydrates, and a makeup that’s free of any sugar alcohols, gluten, or artificial sweeteners. “Legion High Protein Bars score 4 out of 5 for their formulation, with deductions for the erythritol, added sugar, and fat content,” BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois says. “The Chocolate Peanut Butter was very chocolate-focused,” BarBend editorial member Ben Emminger says, scoring the flavor a 3.5 out of 5. “I didn’t get as much peanut butter taste as I would have liked — I only really noticed it in the aftertaste.” Nevertheless, if you’re a chocolate fan, he compares this one to a Hershey’s Kiss. Considering the amount of protein per bar, the texture isn’t the best. “This protein bar is pretty dense and hard to bite,” Emminger says, rating its texture 3 out of 5. “This could be tough for people with sensitive teeth to bite into.” For those who prefer a chewier option, we recommend one of our other picks. That being said, this bar does pack a lot of protein, which is great for athletes who want to swap out their protein shake. This product is pretty pricey at $3.33 per bar but considering the protein density, we gave the overall value a 4 out of 5. “ Each bar is 250 calories, making it a worthwhile solution for quick breakfasts or satiety in-between my normal meals,” says Emminger, noting its tough texture. “Outside of the workout needed to bite into the bar, I feel as though this Legion bar did well. “ These crunchy bars are reminiscent of a rice crispy treat that's packed with protein and absent all that unwanted sugar. They're a nice change from normal chewy protein bars. Texture is a big part of what makes food enjoyable. If you’re tired of the same old grainy protein bar texture, you might want to pick up one of these snacks that are more like a rice treat. After giving it a try, our testers give Promix Crunchy Puff Bars a 4.5 out of 5 for texture. Promix features whole food ingredients and third-party testing results available to view for each product. Plus, these are a great choice for people looking to prioritize protein and keep carbs and fats minimal. “You get a nice helping of protein per serving, but it is fairly low in carbs and fat,” according to our expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, who rates the formula a 4 out of 5. “I like it when supplements stay true to their name and serve as a supplemental boost to a well-balanced diet.” BarBend editorial member Ben Emminger appreciates the flavor profile of these unique high protein snacks , which he notes are light and not too rich. “I enjoy the chocolate flavor,” he says, rating the taste a 5 out of 5. “It’s just like a chocolate Rice Krispies treat.” These aren’t high enough in calories to qualify as the best meal replacement , so if that’s what you’re looking for, you may want a different bar. Nevertheless, our team found these pretty filling. “Having one of these bars was pretty satisfying,” another BarBend tester says, giving the effects a 4 out of 5. The price is also approachable at $2.67 per serving, albeit slightly higher than some protein bars we included in this round-up, earning a 4 out of 5 for cost. For the uniqueness and interesting makeup, though, we’re willing to pay the extra coin and get a nice dose of nostalgia along with our daily macros. For those following a plant-based diet, 1st Phorm has you covered. These bars are completely vegan-friendly and they pack 15 grams of protein per serving, ideal for a post-workout snack. Protein bars can be filled with processed, artificial ingredients but that’s not the case with 1st Phorm’s Vegan Power Pro Bar. This protein uses all natural, whole ingredients, even sweetening the formula with stevia (not an artificial sugar). “I appreciate that many of the ingredients in these protein bars come from whole food sources. It’s these wholesome ingredients that provide a hefty dose of several vitamins and minerals in each serving,” says our excerpt reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, rating its formulation 3.5 out of 5. “These protein bars feature some impressive whole-food ingredients. However, their fat content may not be appropriate for everyone.” Taste-wise we admittedly aren’t huge fans of the flavor. “It’s not something I would initially reach for, but if it’s what I have on me and I’m hungry, it’ll get the job done,” says BarBend editorial member and certified personal trainer Rosie Borchert. She rates the taste 3.5 out of 5. “At least there are a good amount of chocolate chunks mixed in that were delicious, moist, and helped break up the chalkier taste.” “Some of the bar was a bit dry, but I expected that since it is a vegan bar,” she adds, giving its dense texture just a 2.5 out of 5. Aside from the texture, though, Borchert doesn’t notice any negative side effects. Price-wise, Legion’s bars are pretty approachable, earning a 4 out of 5 for cost. One 15-bar box costs $42.99, which is about $2.86 per bar. And you can even subscribe to monthly deliveries and save money. Bulletproof's Protein Crisp Bars are extremely calorie-friendly, making them an easy addition into any weight-loss or fat-loss diet. We also love the clean, whole food ingredients. Having a low-calorie protein bar in your snack cabinet is a great way to stick to your weight-loss plan while enjoying a delicious, filling treat. For those looking to lose weight, we recommend Bulletproof’s Protein Crisp Bar. We like that this bar has zero artificial sweeteners and it’s completely gluten-free, dairy-free, and keto-friendly. It also contains stevia and monk fruit extract as sweetening agents, which most people probably prefer to artificial sugars. However, these do contain peanuts and almonds, which may not work with everyone. We also wish they were a little more protein-dense. “These protein bars provide more calories from fat than protein,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says, rating the formula a 3 out of 5. “As these are considered a protein supplement, I would have expected more emphasis on protein.” After trying out the Chocolate Mint Chip, BarBend editorial member Ben Emminger rates these bars 4.5 out of 5 overall. “The initial bites are minty, almost like a peppermint patty, but the chocolate soon begins to work its way into the picture,” he says. “Overall, not a bad experience.” “ The ‘crisp’ nomenclature refers to the rice crisps contained in the bar. The chocolate was soft but not overly chewy, so the rice bits did break up the mouthfeel well enough,” Emminger notes, scoring its texture 4.5 out of 5. “The bar itself had a glossy aesthetic which often means a sticky exterior, so I’d recommend eating these protein bars by using the wrapper as a holding device. “ “ Honestly, these bars were a nice experience but not world-changing, in my opinion,” Emminger adds. “The included crisps provided a good mouthfeel and the flavor was appealing, but I have other bars that I’d prefer, still. Plus, the 11 grams of protein may be too low for some dietary needs. “ Bulletproof’s protein bars earn a 4 out of 5 for cost, as they’re about $2.99 per bar. This isn’t the most expensive product on this list but you can still find cheaper options. We do like that you can subscribe to recurring deliveries for 20 percent off, though. Orgain Protein Snack Bars are a great on-the-go snack that provides a hit of protein. They’re also helpful as a quick post-workout snack. Each bar has 10g of vegan protein sourced from rice and peas as well as low sugar with no artificial flavors or preservatives. While most protein bars on the market contain whey, that’s certainly not the case for Orgain’s Protein Snack Bar. These are completely vegan-friendly with zero animal-based ingredients. You also get 10 grams of plant protein per serving from brown rice and peas. This product is certified plant based, so those following a vegan diet can eat these in confidence. We do wish the formula contained a little more protein, though, as one serving only provides 10 grams. “The protein content is pretty modest compared to the rest of the market, and the added sugar and sugar alcohol content may not be ideal for everyone,” said Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who rated the formula a 3.5 out of 5. “These taste really good, especially for a plant-based protein bar,” our tester says, rating the flavor a 5 out of 5. “I ate the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and it didn’t taste too earthy like some other plant-based protein bars.” We also like the texture more than some of the other bars we’ve tried, giving this category a 5 out of 5. “The texture actually reminded me of cookie dough,” our tester adds. “It’s soft and chewy, definitely matching the flavor description.” Our tester does note a little mouth dryness but it’s far from a deal-breaker. “I’m surprised by how much I enjoyed this bar,” they say. “But you do get a little bit of an aftertaste due to the artificial ingredients, like erythritol.” Those who don’t love artificial ingredients may prefer another pick. These are also super price-friendly at only $1.99 per bar. We gave the cost a 5 out of 5, as they’re among the most budget-friendly protein bars on this list. If you’re craving a candy-style bar without all the added sugar, these keto protein bars have 14 grams of protein with only four net grams of carbs and seven to 10 grams of fat. Looking to limit your carbs and chow on some protein bars that are high in fat instead? If you’re following a keto diet , this protein bar can be a great option for you. It can be tough to find a good keto protein bar, but Nick’s Keto Snack Bar takes care of business. Each bar only has 4 net grams of carbs, 10 grams of fat, and two grams of sugar — but the 12 to 15 grams of protein can keep you fueled up. Our team gave the formulation a 4 out of 5 here, as the higher fat content may not work for everyone. There are no added sugars in these bars, but their full chunks of nuts and layers of texture make these protein bars feel like candy bars. Naturally, though, we advise those sensitive to nut allergens to forgo this protein bar option. As tasty as these bars are, though, we don’t recommend them for athletes looking to replace a meal with a worthwhile protein bar. The calorie count sits between 160 and 190 depending on the flavor, which is sufficient for a snack, but not enough to substitute for a dish containing whole foods. We liked the cost for these, too, giving this category a 5 out of 5. One bar only costs $1.99, which is far cheaper than some other options on this list. Pure Protein Bars are a budget-friendly protein bar that pack 21 grams of protein per serving, making them a perfect protein shake alternative. They're also available on Amazon Prime! For those shopping on a budget, paying more than $3 per protein bar is a pretty steep cost. But you can find high-quality protein bars for just over $1 per serving and that’s why we recommend Pure Protein Bars. At only $1.18 per bar (and available on Amazon Prime), these are a bargain. Our team gave this product a 5 out of 5 for cost. “Despite picking up way more chocolate than peanut butter, I really enjoy the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor,” says BarBend editorial member Matt Cummings, who rates its taste 4.5 out of 5. “Honestly, it’s pretty close to a Reese’s and not the typical “manufactured” protein bar taste I’ve experienced before.” Pure Protein Bars are chewy and rich without much dryness at all — texture earns a 4 out of 5 from Cummings. “The inside had the nougat-like thickness of a Three Musketeer’s bar,” he says. “Overall, though, they are pretty thick and take a little effort to chew.” For those wanting a pretty natural protein bar, though, these may not be the best choice. We do like the 20 grams of protein per serving, which is more than you get with some all-natural options. “These protein bars get the job done, but the use of sugar alcohols and its saturated fat content may be enough reason for some people to avoid them,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says, giving the formula a 3.5 out of 5. rating. Compared to other options on the market, Cummings thinks that Pure Protein Bars are a solid choice. “Protein bars I’ve had in the past seem like they are just doing their best to taste like a candy bar or fruit bar,” he says. “Pure Protein is probably the closest to a Reese’s or Three Musketeer’s bar that I’ve tried.” This natural meat-based protein bar is perfect for dieters who want to avoid carbs and lean into fats. Depending on the flavor you choose, they pack around 130 calories per bar, and between seven and 13 grams of protein, five to 13 grams of fat, and one and eight grams of carbs. There are not too many true low-carb protein bars on the market. Most protein bars will have higher fiber content with minimal carbs, which is typically promoted as a lower net carb content. Although, with respect to true carb minimalism, few bars truly accomplish this. At a meager one to three carbs per bar, EPIC Bars are the perfect fit for the best low-carb protein bar. You can buy bars made from a variety of meat sources, including pork, chicken, beef and bison. They are Whole-30, keto-approved and are free of GMOs. Depending on the flavor you choose, they pack between 7 and 13 grams of protein, 5 to 13 grams of fat, and 1 and 8 grams of carbs. They also have minimal added ingredients and zero nitrates or nitrites added, earning the formula a 4.5 out of 5. I’m personally a huge fan of the bison bars. These have some dried cranberries in the bar, which adds some moisture. The berries also add to the overall flavor, which I’d give a 4 out of 5. I’ve also tried the venison, which I found to be a little drier and less appetizing overall. As far as texture is concerned, I rate these bars a 4.5 out of 5. They feel a lot like beef jerky but they aren’t too chewy. I don’t think the bison bars are very dry at all but that wasn’t really the case with the venison. That being said, venison is known for being a very lean protein, so the dryness makes sense. Naturally, the animal-based makeup of these treats doesn’t align with certain diets. We wouldn’t recommend these bars for athletes that are plant-based in their nutrition (we have other recommendations for those needs). Still, if you’re looking to mix things up and want a unique flavor to compliment your daily nutrition, consider EPIC’s lineup of animal-based protein snacks. At $2.77 per bar, we gave the cost a 3.75 out of 5. They aren’t the cheapest product on the market but these bars are unique and contain clean ingredients. In my opinion, they’re definitely worth the cost. Read our full EPIC Protein Bars Review . The BarBend team of registered dietitians, certified nutrition coaches, and personal trainers has downed over 35 different protein bars to gather the best of the best. After tasting as many flavors as we could get our hands on, we scrutinized the labels to see what was under the hood. Following BarBend ’s supplement testing methodology , we assigned ratings of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) across multiple categories, including formulation, taste, and value. Check out a few of the key factors we considered during testing. [Read More: Best Mass Gainers , Tested by Experts and RD Approved] When looking at protein bars, you’re likely to find differences within each makeup. Some may contain milk proteins or artificial ingredients, while others contain a completely plant-based formulation. We could really get into the weeds when it comes to all the differentiators between brands and makeups, so for the sake of simplicity, let’s focus on one area that matters most in protein bars — the protein source. Many of the top protein bars utilize whey as a protein source. Whey is a derivative of milk, and therefore an animal-based source of protein. It comes from the process of making cheese, and can be broken down into a concentrate. That concentrate can be broken down even further into a protein isolate, which is often considered a gold standard in protein bars and powders. Other animal-based protein sources include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and other dairy products. While these can be used in protein blends for certain protein bars — or even primary sources, as seen in EPIC’s lineup of meat-based bars — whey or milk-derived protein is still the most common. [Read More: The Best Protein Powders for Men , Tested and Reviewed] While dairy and animal-based protein sources are heavily represented in the protein bar category, there are plant-based options out there that can still deliver worthwhile macro dosages. Beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and whole grains are heavily used in plant-based protein bars — many of which we’ve included in this guide. These options can be great for athletes following strict diets, or those sensitive to dairy or other animal products. While plant-based protein bars can be great for such nutritional needs, we do recommend paying close attention to the listed calories in bars of this type. Nuts, for example, can be rich in protein and fat, but tend to be more calorie dense than other options. ( 12 ) It’s also important to choose a protein bar with a complete amino acid profile. Not all plant proteins contain all nine essential amino acids; often, a combination is required to deliver all of them. Look for pea and soy proteins, which do contain all nine (but are low in certain ones), or combos like brown rice and pea protein together. [Read More: Benefits of Pea Protein ] Protein bars can be worthwhile alternatives to protein shakes and whole foods every now and again, giving your palette a nice mix-up while still delivering hearty helpings of vital macronutrients. Below are some of the benefits that can come with adding these tasty treats to your repertoire. Protein is the building block of the muscle and is responsible for muscle gain (if you’re in a caloric surplus) or muscle retention (if you’re in a caloric deficit ). ( 11 ) According to Harvard Health, the recommended dietary intake for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, or 0.36 grams per pound, but up to 2.0 grams per kilogram of body weight is considered better for muscle growth and sustaining muscle mass in athletes. ( 3 )( 14 ) Rather than breaking out the calculator to confirm your daily servings, use our protein intake calculator to figure out how much you need. Exercise: 15-30 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Intense exercise: 45-120 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Very intense exercise: 2+ hours of elevated heart rate activity. Before choosing your go-to protein bar, it can be helpful to line up the cost of each option. Take a quick look at how much you can expect to spend on each of our top picks. Finding the ideal protein bar for your nutritional needs may seem like a daunting task with all the options and formulations available. It doesn’t need to be a complicated matter, though, if you keep the following factors in mind when searching through the available snacks on the market. When you’re thinking about investing in protein bars, you want to consider your training goals and how you want your supplements to fuel your progress. In the gym, are you mostly training right now to build muscle ? To lose weight? Regardless, you’ll want a protein bar that matches what you’re putting your body through during workouts. Check to see whether the bar you’re interested in is on the upper or lower end of the protein bar calorie range, typically between 150 and 300 calories. Which protein bar is right for you also depends on your eating habits throughout the day. Do you tend to be on the run after your workout? You may need a bar that’s higher in protein to make sure you are properly refueling post-workout . Or, maybe, you just want a protein bar to keep in your bag to stave off hunger between meals. In that case, it might be less about total protein levels and more about something that’s going to taste good and keep you full. A bar high in fiber can help with satiety.. In the end, be sure to look for a protein bar that compliments your regular intake rather than throws your nutrition out of whack. The best nutrition plan is one containing plenty of whole foods, therefore your protein bars should act as accessory pieces instead of the leading roles. Thinking about what your body and mind need from your food is also of primary importance. If you don’t want to count calories, try to check out the ingredients instead. Do you want something with pure cane sugar or sweeteners like honey? Maybe it’s most important to you that your protein bar be as unprocessed as possible and free of any artificial ingredients. You’ll also need to think about your specific dietary needs and restrictions when deciding on a protein bar. If you follow a diet such as keto, Paleo, veganism, or others, be sure to look and see if your protein bar’s formulation fits within your guidelines. [Read More: The Best Protein Powders for Women , RDN-Approved] Of course, you’re going to find more enjoyment and positivity with your protein bar selection if the flavor pleases your palate. Make sure your protein bar offers an enticing taste that you’d likely enjoy on a regular basis. It can also be helpful to go with a bar offering multiple flavors. This can give you some leeway down the road if you begin to suffer some flavor fatigue. The additional flavor variety can be helpful in keeping your formulations relatively the same while still making for a tasty treat. Finally, protein bars are a nice snack to have on hand, but they shouldn’t be a major detriment to your daily budget. Most bars will range in prices from roughly $1.50 to $3.50, so be sure you can afford your daily treat before opting for a specific profile. If you’re really intrigued by a more expensive protein bar, consider saving that specific formulation for special occasions. This can be a good way to motivate yourself in training while also keeping your needs satisfied with a worthwhile snack. Yes and no. Protein bars with a lot of sugar content and/or artificial ingredients are not really healthy and there are likely better options for foods to consume. However, if you’re in need of a convenient, high-protein snack, and they’re an option compared to something like a candy bar, then there’s an argument to be made that they are healthier in comparison. It depends. Protein bars can be used as tools to aid with long-term weight loss in the greater scope of one’s diet, but protein bars alone are not inherently magic or overly healthy compared to natural, nutrient-dense foods. The best protein bar is subjective, as every athlete has different nutritional needs and varying flavor preferences. For our money, though, we recommend Transparent Labs Protein+ Bar. Protein bars can be a suitable snack for just about anyone, kids included. However, it’s important to make sure to double check that the bars you choose don’t conflict with any of your children’s allergies or health conditions. Protein bars aren’t a sufficient meal replacement, either. Any food can contribute to weight gain if you’re eating more calories than you’re burning, though some are less likely than others due to caloric density. You’re much less likely to gain weight by eating apples and broccoli than chips and pizza because of the difference in calorie density. Protein bars differ greatly in calorie count, from as little as 100 to more than 300, so be sure to check the label before you buy. There’s no best time to consume your protein — the best time is when it’s most convenient for you. That said, your workout schedule might prevent you from being able to eat a full meal within a few hours of training. Or, you might just like having a protein bar on hand — especially if you travel around a lot during the day, or train early in the morning on an empty stomach.

    "text": "When it comes to foundational supplements, protein reigns supreme. “ Protein powder can help anyone build muscles, manage weight, and recover after workouts, ” says Dr. Raj Dasgupta, MD. Some of the best protein powders on the market can do wonders for your protein intake while also initiating muscle protein synthesis and restorative muscle tissue repair. ( 1 ) While this is all fine and dandy for helping you achieve your fitness goals and build muscle, the best-tasting protein powders can make your nutritional progress even more fulfilling through rich flavors and tasty makeups you’ll want to come back to day in and day out — after all, how effective is a supplement if you don’t every consume it? Naturally, however, we understand that it can be difficult to find a good-tasting protein shake based on product descriptions alone. So, to help you fine tune your search — and save your taste buds from otherwise displeasing formulas — we got hands-on with dozens of protein powders, taste-testing them ourselves using our supplement testing methodology to land on our list of the best-tasting protein powders available today.

Join BarBend expert tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC , and registered dietician nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD , as they discuss our best flavored protein powders, including vanilla, chocolate, and plant-based picks. With 8 different flavors and 28 grams of whey protein from hormone-free, grass-fed cows, Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is an excellent way to hit your protein macros. The best-tasting protein will offer plenty of flavor options with little to no artificial ingredients, like Transparent Labs Whey Isolate. Not only does Transparent Labs offer 13 flavor options, the powder’s rich flavor and smooth texture speak for themselves. I’ve personally tried the Milk Chocolate flavor plenty of times and it truly tasted like a milk chocolate bar. Flavor scores a 5 out of 5. We like how Transparent Labs uses 100-percent grass-fed whey isolate as its protein source for this shake. Whey isolate is a leaner, more protein-rich form of the macronutrient thanks to the extra filtering process that removes any lactose or fat content. ( 10 ) Additionally, we enjoy how (ahem) transparent the brand is with listed ingredients and dosages. Whey Protein Isolate is third-party tested for any banned substances (we rate it at 5 out of 5 for the category), and every profile, regardless of flavor, is free of any artificial preservatives, coloring, or sweeteners. “This is one of the only protein powders I’ve seen that shows you everything — including the weight of each of its ingredients,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer. Based on our own testing, we graded Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate at a B overall for purity. This protein sample scored in the top 25 percent among all sampled powders for heavy metals, and the top 10 percent for the presence of bisphenols, phthalates, and pesticides. In testing this protein powder, our tester says the formulation mixed easily with milk and water, with no unpleasant aftereffects. “I’ve been taking this for a month now, and really enjoy the flavor profile. Getting a shake down is easy, and I haven’t experienced any stomach or digestive issues after drinking it as I sometimes do with other whey protein powders.” We do rate this Whey Protein Isolate a 4.5 out of 5 for side effects, though, given its inclusion of stevia as a sweetening agent. Some athletes may experience a bitter aftertaste as a result, but our testers had no issue. It comes down to your tolerance, though, so it’s best to keep this information handy before ordering a tub. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD also recommends paying close attention to the sodium content of your chosen flavor. “Some flavors of Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate contain up to 370 milligrams of sodium per scoop, which is higher than many other protein powders on the market,” she states. That knocked the score for formula down a bit in her professional opinion, but she still awarded it 4.5 out of 5 points Transparent Labs only offers Whey Protein Isolate in 30-serving tubs. This may be displeasing to athletes who tend to order in bulk, and for them we’d recommend brands like Nutricost and Bulk Supplements, who each offer multiple options to buy in bulk. Read our full Transparent Labs Whey Isolate Protein Review . Nutricost's Whey Protein Concentrate comes in five different flavors and packs 25 grams of protein per serving. This product is also available in two- and five-pound containers, making it easier to buy in bulk. You don’t need to spend an arm and a leg for a solid, tasty protein powder, thanks to Nutricost’s Whey Protein Concentrate. This product only costs $1.42 per serving, earning a 5 out of 5 for value. You can even buy this protein in bulk, allowing you to save even more or subscribe to recurring deliveries for a 20% discount. “Generally, I don’t love peanut butter but I did sample the Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor and was surprised by how much I liked it,” says our tester, who scores the taste a 5 out of 5 rating. “The amount of peanut isn’t too overpowering and I really enjoyed it.” “Nutricost Whey Concentrate is a fairly lean protein powder,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian nutritionist, who scores the formulation a 3.5 out of 5. “It still provides more carbs and fat than your average isolate powder, but it does a good job of prioritizing protein over the other macros. I like when supplements provide specific nutrients so it’s easier to fit them into a well-balanced diet and bridge nutrition gaps as needed. Plus, it contains a 2:1:1 ratio of your BCAAs which has research has shown to be most effective .” If you’d prefer a protein supp with fewer carbs and fats, you may want to check out Nutricost’s Whey Protein Isolate , which contains less cholesterol and no saturated fat. This product’s solubility also earns a perfect 5 out of 5 score. After mixing the product in a shaker cup, our tester didn’t notice any clumping. It actually mixed really well and dissolved smoothly, she said. The texture, too, was rich and creamy, much like a melted milkshake. Luckily, our tester didn’t notice any negative side effects, either, giving her overall experience with Nutricost’s protein a perfect 5 out of 5 score, too. “I really loved this,” she said. “Even my partner who has a sensitive stomach with protein didn’t notice any unrest or problems with this one — plus, I love the price point.” Gainful Plant-Based Protein Powder offers up to 24 grams of organic brown rice and pea protein, which delivers a complete amino acid profile. Right now, take 50% off your first order with the code: BF50. Supplementing with protein can be a great habit for athletes following different types of diets, too. One of the best vegan protein powders comes from Gainful. This tasty supplement features a blend of organic brown rice and pea protein resulting in up to 24 grams of protein per serving. Plus, we like the use of a plant-based protein blend as it helps create a complete amino acid profile for better recovery and performance. Gainful’s Vegan Protein comes unflavored to start, but the brand offers unique flavor boost packs that allow you to create a different taste with each shake. “I’ve tried multiple packs and really enjoy the variety,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer, who rated the taste at 5 out of 5. “Having the ability to control your flavors without ordering multiple tubs is fun and convenient. It’s great to switch from Vanilla to Sea Salt Caramel and Chocolate Peanut Butter whenever I please.” As a brand, Gainful operates under a subscription service. While this may not be ideal for every budget — especially with expensive costs per serving starting at $3.21 — but we do see some perks to this format. For one, Gainful subscribers have access to their own registered dietitian which can be a helpful resource when outlining your nutrition goals. Additionally, a subscription helps ensure you’re always well-stocked with protein month after month. Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois rated the formula with 4.5 out of 5 points, noting, “ Goals change over time, as do nutrition needs, so it’s great that there’s support in place when customers have questions about switching formulas.” While we like the available flavors offered with Gainful’s Vegan Protein, we do recommend paying close attention to your blending protocols. “I would suggest mixing your shakes with a countertop blender as opposed to your standard shaker bottle,” notes our tester. “Especially when blending the powder with milk. I often found some clumps in my drink that threw off the consistency and mouthfeel.” As such, we scored the solubility at 3 out of 5. As a final note, be sure to think about your fitness goals when ordering this plant-based powder. The 120 calories per serving may not be ideal for those wanting to put on mass, but could be worthwhile for those wanting the best protein powder for weight loss . If its weight gain you’re after, we recommend checking out mass gainer supplements from the likes of Transparent Labs or Optimum Nutrition. Read our full Gainful Protein Powder Review . Dig into this easily digesting grass-fed whey isolate that provides 25 grams of protein with each lean 110 calorie scoop. It comes in three tasty flavors at a cost-effective price making it a solid choice for nearly anyone. Jacked Factory’s Authentic ISO is a top-tier protein supp in the taste department, thanks in no small part to their impressive menu of nine different flavors. Our tester states that this flavorful protein supplement, one of the best whey protein powders we’ve tested, was enjoyable, if a bit sweet for their palate. “I tried the Vanilla offering and found it to be palatable. I did sense some excessive sweetness, but I’m sure that’s just my personal taste buds chiming in,” they say in reference to their 4 out of 5 rating for taste. “I also appreciate that this powder blended easily in my shaker,” they add . “I mixed with both water and almond milk and found no drop-off in terms of solubility or flavor.” Solubility scores a 4 out of 5. We score the formulation a 5 out of 5, as we’re impressed by its macro balance of up to 27 grams of protein, up to 4 grams of carbohydrates, and up to just 1.5 grams of fat per serving. However, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. does point out that this whey protein isolate does lack third-party testing. While we do appreciate the transparent ingredients list that’s free of any proprietary blends, having a stamp of approval from recognized agencies like Informed Sport or NSF would be a nice touch, especially for strength athletes that need to strictly abide by their respective governing agencies. If you’re interested in an alternative with third-party testing, check out offerings from Transparent Labs or Legion. BarBend , however, worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Jacked Factory landed in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. Finally, the cost per serving of Authentic ISO was a breath of fresh air for us. We appreciated the lower-than-average $1.33 price per serving, which can be more approachable for wallet-minded individuals. Other proteins of this caliber can often cost between $1.50 and $2, so while it’s not an excessive amount of savings, those pennies and dimes can begin to add up over the course of a regular supplement schedule. Read our full Jacked Factory Authentic ISO Review. Offering 25 grams pf whey protein isolate alongside nearly 7 grams of BCAAs, Sports Research Whey Protein Isolate is a great option for those looking to supplement their diets, build muscle, and enhance workout recovery. The modern world demands convenience. Thankfully, the best protein powders on Amazon offer excellent performance and rich tastes, giving you the power to knock out all your purchases for training, your home, and other needs in one fell swoop. For our money, we feel that Whey Protein Isolate from Sports Research stands out as the best-tasting option on the platform. Amazon offers both one-time and subscription-based purchases, which can be helpful for those that may be forgetful when it comes time to restock their supplement cabinet. The subscription option also allows you to save a little dough. One downside? There are only two flavors currently available. Thankfully, our tester, a former Olympian, likes them both. “I was especially pleased with the creaminess of the Vanilla, which isn’t regular with other proteins I’ve had,” they note in reference to their 5 out of 5 taste rating. “The Chocolate and Dutch Chocolate powders are no slouches, either.” If the lack of flavor variety is an obstacle for you, we’d recommend checking out the robust offerings from Transparent Labs, Legion, and Jacked Factory. Solubility scores a 5 out of 5. “Mixed great in a shaker cup, ” they say . “Not chunky at all and I found it smooth to drink.” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD, also commented on the formulation, stating. “This is a pretty impressive whey protein powder — just take a look at its amino acid profile. It contains 25 grams of protein per serving, including 6.9 grams of BCAAs , but minimal carbs and fat.” We rated the formulation at 4.5 out of 5, though, as the calorie count may not be ideal for those wanting to put on mass. An all natural, non-GMO, fat-free whey that's cheaper than many competitors, Legion Whey Isolate Protein Powder is made from 100 percent grass-fed whey protein isolate from sustainable dairy farms in Ireland. It's also higher in calcium compared to other powders on the market. If you’re looking for an all-natural protein supplement that’s free of any artificial additives, Legion’s Whey+ one of the best clean protein powders we’ve tested. This protein powder is naturally sweetened and features a makeup that’s free of hormones, GMOs, lactose, and what the brand calls “unnecessary junk.” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD appreciates this no-nonsense approach to supplements from Legion, stating, “Legion products focus on research-backed nutrition, and their Whey+ protein powder is no exception. Whey+ is clinically dosed to support muscle building and workout recovery.” After analyzing the formula, she gave it 4.75 out of 5. Legion is third-party tested, but we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test it alongside more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Legion landed in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. Additionally, we like how Legion Whey+ ensures that the cows they source its whey isolate from are kept in the most ideal conditions possible. This is an upside for anyone who has concerns about animal welfare, which we hope is everyone! Whey+ is certified by Truly Grass Fed, meaning the cows that produce the brand’s dairy are antibiotic-free and hormone-free, and spend 90% of their life roaming grassy fields. We had no issues mixing this powder, with our tester, a certified personal trainer, scoring its solubility a 5 out of 5. “There were no problems when I mixed this protein with a shaker bottle,” they say. They do recommend really giving this formulation a good shake for roughly 20 seconds to ensure you’re not left with any unpleasant clumps. Taste-wise, each of its 16 flavors is appealing with its sweetness and profile. Our tester, who sampled the Cinnamon Cereal variety, says, “It tasted like the end of the bowl from a particular childhood breakfast staple. You know, when you’ve consumed all the cereal and the milk has absorbed all the sugar? I see this being a big hit with some athletes.” Flavor scores a 4 out of 5. The macronutrients offered in each Whey+ serving vary by your chosen flavor, but we found that you can expect between 21 and 23 grams of protein, 2 and 6 grams of carbs, and 1 and 4 grams of fats per dose. While this may be plenty for most athletes, some may find the protein content lacking. If that’s you, the 28 grams of protein in Transparent Labs Whey Isolate may be more up your alley. Read our full Legion Whey+ Review . This clean, transparent protein powder relies on organic, non-GMO yellow peas for its 20-gram protein dosage. Additionally, the subscription-based model helps ensure you’re always stocked up to help you meet your nutritional goals day in and day out. For athletes wanting a worthwhile plant protein, it’s tough to beat Ritual’s Daily Shake 18+ formulation. This concoction relies on pea protein for its measured 20 grams per serving, and on top of that, Ritual blends in an extra 400 milligrams of L-methionine for a complete amino acid profile. Even some of the best pea protein powders don’t include this additive, leaving the formulation a little lacking when it comes to essential amino acids. “Methionine is an essential amino acid, meaning our bodies need it but can’t produce it, so it’s super convenient to get it in your protein powder,” states BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. She also likes that it’s third-party tested, resulting in her 4.5 out of 5 formulation score. We enjoy the taste and solubility of this vanilla-flavored protein shake. Our tester states, “I like adding this powder to my morning smoothies. The vanilla is present but not overwhelming. Plus, this has excellent consistency when blended.” Unfortunately, though, you’re locked into that vanilla bean profile — it’s the only flavor offered at the time of writing. If you’re interested in options with a larger roster of flavors, check out protein options from Legion and Transparent Labs. We also appreciate its solubility, which we score a 5 out of 5. “I was surprised at how much I liked the consistency of this protein,” says our tester. “The texture is smooth, not thick and it wasn’t too watery either. All I did was shake it in a blender cup.” One downside? Ritual’s Daily Shake 18+ comes in a 15-serving bag, which is a smaller container than other protein powders on the market. Thankfully, the brand operates on a subscription-based service, so you automatically get signed up for repeat orders at the time of your initial purchase. We understand this method isn’t for every athlete, though. One serving of this supplement packs 20 grams of grass-fed protein with few added ingredients. You can buy a bag for $64.95, which is about $2.70 per serving. For those who want a grass-fed whey protein formula that tastes delicious, our testers recommend Momentous Grass-Fed Whey. Momentous sources their protein from European dairy farmers who grass-feed their cows. Plus, the brand even includes digestive enzymes for those who tend to experience stomach upset. “Momentous Whey Protein Isolate scores a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation, with deductions for its cost per serving and the presence of proprietary blends,” according to BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “I love that Momentous collaborates with dietitians when formulating their products and I love love love that they link up-to-date research that backs their product’s ingredients.” Our tester also likes the flavor, giving it an overall 4 out of 5 rating. “I will say, I preferred this product with milk,” they say. “Mixing this protein powder with water wasn’t sweet enough and it was a little thin.” That said, it mixes extremely well, resulting in a 5 out of 5 solubility score. “ I mixed a double scoop in water, which is double the dose,” our tester says, giving this protein a 5 out of 5 for solubility . “It still mixed really well even in just a cup.” Unfortunately, though, high-quality ingredients come at a high price. This powder costs $2.70 per serving, which is pricier than most other products on the market. If you’re in the market for a budget protein supplement, we’d steer you towards brands like Nutricost and Optimum Nutrition. Read our full Momentous Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate Review . Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein is a tried and true mainstay of fitness supplement programs. Ahh, chocolate — one of the predominant flavors in the protein powder category. While many brands offer this delectable flavor, few do it better than Optimum Nutrition. The flavor roster boasts eight (yes, eight) varieties of chocolate-based tastes, each with their own notes of flavor-packed performance. “I’ve been using Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard since I got into fitness,” says our tester, a certified nutrition coach. “I routinely reach for the Double Rich Chocolate variety when I need a dependable high-protein source.” If you’re not a chocolate fan, Optimum Nutrition has you covered still with a wide range of available flavors. In our testing, we’ve tried some of the best Optimum Nutrition flavors such as Coffee, Cookies and Cream, Delicious Strawberry, Banana Cream, and others with no real negatives outside of subjective palate preferences. “I love that it’s third-party tested and available in 18 flavors. No getting bored with the taste of this protein powder,” adds BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. We score its solubility a 4 out of 5. “I could see where mixing this with water alone may lead to a thinner consistency than desired,” says our one tester. “But I often mix my protein in a smoothie with milk and other ingredients, so there were no qualms or complaints from my end.” As far as the formulation is concerned, Gold Standard uses a protein blend to generate its 24 grams per serving. “It’s interesting that Optimum Nutrition uses a blend of whey protein concentrate, whey protein isolate, and hydrolyzed whey protein for its Gold Standard formula. It would be nice to know how much of each type of protein is included in the blend. It also uses artificial flavorings, which is a turn off for some.” She scores the formulation a 4 out of 5. If those artificial flavors are a turn-off for you, check out some of the best organic protein powders , such as Legion and Ritual’s all-natural offerings. This product is third-party tested, but we also conducted our own independent study and graded the Vanilla Ice Cream flavor option an A. This protein powder scored in the top 10% of over 150 protein products tested for the presence of heavy metals, pesticides, phthalates, and bisphenols. Gold Standard Whey Protein also scored in the top 10% for label accuracy. Read our full Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey Protein Review . A grass-fed whey isolate includes added ingredients for digestion like seven digestive enzymes and a probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus). It's also gluten-free, sugar-free, and soy-free. Vanilla is a pretty versatile protein flavor. You can put it in smoothies, oatmeal, fresh-baked cookies or sip it solo. But since it’s such a simple flavor, it can easily taste overly sweet. Not so with Onnit Grass-Fed Whey Isolate, one of the best whey isolates we’ve tested. We score the formulation at 4.5 out of 5 given the 20 grams of complete protein delivered in each serving. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian nutritionist, adds, “Onnit Whey Protein provides an impressive complete amino acid profile to support muscle gains and workout recovery.” This can be excellent for refueling your body after a long grind in the gym, keeping you ready to tackle the next day’s challenges. We also like how easy this grass-fed whey protein is to mix, scoring the solubility at 5 out of 5. “The powder almost immediately dissolved in my shaker,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer. “You can quickly mix up a shake and be on your way.” We love the flavor of this protein, but found the texture lacking, leading to a 3.75 out of 5 score for taste. “It was good but I wasn’t as pleased with the texture,” our tester says. “It was very thin when you mix it with water, which is how most people drink their protein. The actual flavor did stand out, though.” Speaking of available flavors, we do wish Onnit offered more variety beyond Vanilla and Mexican Chocolate. If you’re someone who prioritizes variety, we’d recommend protein offerings from Legion and Transparent Labs. Lastly, Onnit’s Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is one of the more expensive powders we’ve tested coming in at roughly $2 per serving. This price can be linked to the reliance on whey protein isolate, though, given the extra processing required to reap the protein-rich end product. Read our full Onnit Grass-Fed Whey Isolate Review . The BarBend team is made up of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. To determine the best-tasting protein powders available today, we’ve tested nearly 100 different profiles from the industry’s best brands, using a multi-point methodology to rate each profile on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Below are some of the categories and components that played into our rankings, using our supplement testing methodology . Protein powder is among the most common sports nutrition supplements — and for good reason. Not only does this product help you hit your macros, they’re convenient, versatile, and (especially these picks) delicious. Many of the best protein powder flavors we’ve tested fall on the higher end of the average $1 to $2 per serving cost of protein powders, though you can expect to pay over that average for plant-based options and those rich in BCAAs. When it comes to picking the right product for you, arguably the most important consideration is your individual goals. Once you’ve nailed that down, you’ll need to decide what ingredients you want (or don’t want) in your protein powder. Below are some suggestions to guide you. Your fitness goals should be the main deciding factor for choosing your protein powder. If you’re looking to lean out but still build some muscle, a protein powder with a high protein content that’s lower in calories could help you out. On the other hand, if you’re looking to bulk, you’ll want a good tasting protein powder that’s higher in calories, carbs, and fats to help you pack on some extra mass. Most of the picks on this list are fairly lean though, so if you’re really trying to gain weight, you may want to opt for a mass gainer . ( 8 ) While not all protein powders include additional ingredients, some do, and quite a few on this list fall in that group. Additional ingredients may include a blend of amino acids, digestive enzymes, and/or probiotics . All of these help enhance the work the protein is doing in your body. For example, digestive enzymes may help to ensure you’re absorbing the protein properly. However, as with most supplements that add additional helpful ingredients, this may jack up the price. So, if you’re not keen on having these boosters, you may be able to find a more basic option at a lower price point. Be sure to check the ingredients list for colors, flavor agents, emulsifiers, and anything else you may or may not want in your protein powder. It’s important to note that whey protein does contain lactose. Whey concentrate will typically contain the most amount of lactose, while whey isolate contains a small amount. If you’re sensitive to lactose, the lactose in whey isolate likely will not bother you, but it’s important to discuss it with your doctor. However, if you are still worried, there are plenty of plant-based protein powders you can consider as well that don’t contain any lactose. Though it may be easiest to scoop protein powder into some water and drink, that’s not everyone’s method of choice. Some may prefer to mix it into smoothies, while others may be stirring it into pudding or yogurt. Before you decide which protein powder to buy, you’ll want to consider how you’re consuming it, so you can choose the proper flavor. More basic flavors — like vanilla and chocolate — are best if you are combining your powder into other tasty ingredients. And on the other hand, you may prefer something more unique — like s’mores or cinnamon roll — if you’re just mixing it with water or milk. Protein powders come in tons of flavors, including standard options (chocolate and vanilla) and more unique selections (cinnamon cereal and oatmeal cookie, for instance). When choosing a flavor, prioritize options that you can realistically foresee yourself enjoying each day. We also recommend reading a few reviews before you choose. While flavor is a crucial factor when picking the best protein powder, ingredients matter, too. We recommend prioritizing third-party tested products as often as possible. This means the supplement was verified by an independent third party, who can certify that the ingredients are safe and the label is accurate. Well, protein, obviously. But there can be a lot more than that. Here are some of the ingredients that you’re most likely to find in your tub, including different types of protein . This question does not have a straight answer since taste is subjective. But overall, we like XWERKS Grow — with flavors like Chocolate, Vanilla, Peanut Butter, and Strawberry, there’s something to satisfy most taste preferences. If you are looking for a powder to mix with water, you may prefer something with a little more bite, like Xwerks’ Strawberry. If you’re mixing your powder into a milk, you may want something that would compliment the creaminess, like vanilla or a chocolate variant. Most of the tastiest protein powders cost somewhere between $40 and $60 per tub, but it’s better to look at the cost per serving for a true comparison. Many tubs of protein contain 30 servings, which is a month’s supply if you only take one scoop per day. For most of the proteins on this list, you’ll be looking at anywhere from $1.50 to just over $2 per serving. Whey protein may come with a bit of a chalky taste. If you want to avoid this, you’re better off mixing it in milk, a smoothie, or yogurt, which can help mask the chalky flavor.

    "text": "Protein is one of the most popular supplements on the market. We already know that supplementing with one of the best protein powders can help athletes gain muscle and recover from exercise. ( 1 )( 2 ) But did you know that protein supplements can also help individuals meet their everyday protein needs and even support weight loss? ( 3 ) The best organic protein powders may appeal even more to those looking to take a protein supplement on the daily. There are different sources of organic protein, ranging from pea protein to whey protein. Some protein powders even contain micronutrients, probiotics, superfoods, and digestive enzymes. Thankfully, our team of expert product testers turned to some of the top brands to find the best organic protein powders in this review. Rest assured that all products we reviewed here boast 100-percent organic ingredients. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. This article has been reviewed by Chrissy Arsenault, RDN with notes from Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D. , a registered dietitian with 10 years of experience in the clinical setting. They looked into the research we cite and the efficacy/quality of the organic protein powders we list to help ensure we’re providing advice that’s safe. However, everyone’s body is different, so before you try any new products, it’s best to consult your doctor. The BarBend team is made up of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. To determine the best organic protein powders available today, we’ve tested nearly 100 different profiles from the industry’s best brands, using a multi-point testing methodology to rate each profile on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Below are some of the categories and components that played into our rankings. The products in this roundup typically have a short, pronounceable ingredient list, and easily-digestible protein sources, like whey, casein, or plant-based proteins. High-quality protein supplements should have a solid macronutrient profile consisting of high protein, low carbohydrates, and low fat. They should also contain micronutrients whenever possible to fill any gaps in individuals’ diets. We tried to avoid supplements with excessive artificial ingredients, fillers, preservatives, sugar alcohols like erythritol, or added sugars. We also skipped any protein supplements that list any proprietary blends, as these don’t specify individual ingredient dosages. This makes it difficult to assess their effectiveness and safety. There’s no one-size-fits-all when it comes to choosing the best organic protein powder. Some individuals might be looking for a protein powder that will support their athletic performance or weight loss, while others might be looking for one that meets specific dietary needs, like gluten-free or vegan. However, in this process, we were also cautious of supplements that make unrealistic or miraculous claims about rapid muscle gain, fast recovery, extreme weight loss, or instant results. Remember that supplements and their claims are not regulated by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), so it’s important to read the nutrition label and ingredient list. If it’s too good to be true, it probably is. While unrelated to health benefits, try to choose a taste or flavor that you enjoy so that you can consistently use the product and enjoy using it. Some protein powders offer only chocolate or vanilla flavors, while others offer many decadent flavors to choose from. We’ve sampled different flavors and listed out the ones available for each of our picks on this list. You may see some crossover between this list and our picks for the best-tasting protein powders . Again, while unrelated to health benefits, no one likes clumping at the bottom of their shaker bottle. Some tend to mix better in water, while others mix better in milk or non-dairy beverages, like oat milk. Our BarBend product testers have tested the products on this list in water, smoothies, food, and dairy and non-dairy bases to ensure that we can recommend protein shakes that are highly soluble. So, most of the products you’ll see on this list mix well in a shaker bottle. Ask yourself the following questions: Have you heard of the brand? Has the product gone through third-party testing via organizations like NSF to ensure they meet quality and safety standards? A good product will boast third-party certifications on the product label that vouch for their credibility. This is important because supplements are not regulated by the FDA. A surprisingly delicious vegan protein powder that's totally free from artificial ingredients and soy, Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Protein contains a 2:1 ratio of rice to pea protein powder, and four grams of fiber. Sure, the best organic products don’t have to be vegan, but here, Transparent Labs Organic Vegan hits both notes. It’s perfect for organic-conscious athletes looking for a protein powder that will support muscle growth. When your goal is to gain muscle, you may need a lot more protein than the average individual — anywhere from 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram per day. ( 5 ) For example, a 200-pound adult needs 145 grams of protein per day, and this supplement can help you meet your protein goal. This pick gives you a lot of bang for your buck with 24 grams of totally organic, vegan protein per serving. [Related: New Study on Protein Timing: Even 100 Grams Per Meal Isn’t Wasted ] With a short and simple ingredient list, Transparent Labs has created a simple, no-fluff organic protein — we rated it 4 out of 5 for formulation. Additionally, if you are following a vegetarian or vegan diet, iron is a micronutrient that’s often deficient. ( 6 ) BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois says, “ I like that you can meet 30 percent of your daily iron needs with one serving .” However, the sodium content can also be on the higher side for those watching their sodium intake for general wellness or blood pressure. “ It also contains 260-300 milligrams of sodium per scoop, which isn’t a crazy amount, but it does account for around 15 percent of the recommended daily sodium intake ,” Bourgeois adds. As far as taste goes, it’s a little on the earthy side, so we scored it a 2 out of 5. Our tester, who tried the Chocolate flavor, states, “ Not too bad for an organic protein powder. It tastes like a dark chocolate drink (not milk chocolate), but with an earthy hint because of the rice and pea protein. I would not suggest this for people who like sweet/sugary protein drinks. There is not that much sugar and you can really taste the cocoa powder .” This product is also third-party tested through Analytical Resource Laboratories, with its certificate of analysis posted publicly on the Transparent Labs website. This helps ensure its purity, safety, and quality. Read our full Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Protein Review . Jacked Factory's Authentic Vegan protein powder is just about the closest formula to whey protein we can find when it comes to macros. The big appeal of this protein powder, to us, is the price. For what it offers, this vegan product is one of the most affordable we've found. Athletes – look no further. Jacked Factory Authentic Vegan is one of the best vegan protein powders we’ve tested. Studies show that protein supplementation may not necessarily benefit someone who is sedentary, but can help accelerate muscle and strength gains in athletes. ( 7 ) This means that as an athlete, you may consume more protein throughout the day than the average individual and many options out there can be expensive or have too many “extra” ingredients, leaving you feeling not at your best. First, for an athlete, the protein source matters. This product contains a diversified plant protein source to help meet your complete essential amino acid needs, which vegan protein powders often lack. Consuming a product with complete protein is important for athletes because this means that the protein powder contains all the amino acids needed to make new protein in the body, which is essential for muscle gain and recovery. ( 8 ) We scored this product a 4 out of 5 for its high-quality formulation. Second, this supplement is also free from food dyes, chemicals, and fillers, making it an excellent choice for athletes looking for a clean vegan protein powder with a high amount of protein. Although this product isn’t third-party tested, it is manufactured in a GMP-certified facility, which helps ensure its purity and potency. This is important for athletes because a product needs to be free of any banned substances in order for them to compete in their sport. However, this product didn’t score as strongly on practical factors like taste and solubility – with a score of 2 out of 5 on solubility and 3 out of 5 for taste. Our tester states, “ I wasn’t super impressed with the taste and mixability, but I appreciate that the protein powder was easy on my stomach .” Even with a shaker bottle, there were clumps at the bottom of the cup. “I saw a thick layer of protein powder that settled at the bottom of the shaker bottle, despite multiple attempts to shake it, ” our tester adds. [Related: How Much Protein Do You Need for Bodybuilding? ] Onnit's plant-based protein powder is made of a blend of pea, pumpkin, sunflower seed, and watermelon seed proteins. This one is available in two separate flavors, too, including Chocolate and Vanilla. Plant-based protein powders aren’t exactly known for their great taste – they can taste earthy, bitter, or beany, especially compared to their whey counterparts. However, if we had to pick a powder solely based on its taste, we’d choose Onnit Plant-Based Protein – it’s actually good. Our testers rated it an impressive 4.75 out of 5 for taste. It’s only offered in vanilla and chocolate flavors, but who needs more flavors when the ones available are both delicious? [Related: Vegan Diet for Athletes ] Our tester also scored this formulation a solid 4 out of 5. Although Onnit Plant-Based protein consists of plant protein, its protein sources are diversified, so it contains all EAAs to support vegetarian and vegan diets that might be lacking in certain amino acids. In addition to being a great option for vegan diets, it’s dairy-free, gluten-free, soy-free, and contains no sugar. It’s also slightly sweetened with monk fruit and stevia extract. While stevia can sometimes impart a bitter aftertaste, this doesn’t seem to detract from the product’s amazing taste. Additionally, it’s fairly mixable in water or a blender bottle – our product tester gave pretty high marks for this product on solubility, with a score of 4.25 out of 5. Read our full Onnit Plant-Based Protein Review . An all natural, non-GMO, fat-free whey that's cheaper than many competitors, Legion Whey Isolate Protein Powder is made from 100 percent grass-fed whey protein isolate from sustainable dairy farms in Ireland. It's also higher in calcium compared to other powders on the market. Legion Whey+ is our favorite pick out of organic whey proteins because it consists of whey protein isolate as its protein source. Whey protein isolate undergoes further processing, removing more fats, carbohydrates, and lactose, thus “isolating” the whey. This results in a product with a higher protein concentration (usually around 90 percent or higher) and minimal lactose content. Whey+ is one of the best whey isolates we’ve tested. Whey isolate is excellent because it tends to be more nutrient-dense than whey protein, making it a popular choice among individuals with lactose intolerance or those seeking higher protein content per serving. Compared to whey, isolate is also more readily digestible. ( 9 ) Additionally, studies show that consuming whey protein isolate can help improve muscle mass and strength while reducing body fat. ( 10 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D. states, “ Whey+ is clinically dosed to support muscle building and workout recovery. Its macro ratios and ingredient sources are impressive. ” Our team of testers scored this pick a 4.75 out of 5 for its formula. As far as taste goes, our tester scored this product a sparkling 4.5 out of 5 after trying the Cinnamon Cereal and Dutch Chocolate flavors. “ I tried the Dutch chocolate flavor and it honestly tasted great, (if anyone has ever had ovaltine before it tasted very similar), was a pleasant chocolate flavor sweetened with stevia, definitely not too sweet,” he states. [Related: How to Clean Your Protein Shaker Bottle ] He also loved the Cinnamon Cereal flavor, saying, “ It kind of tasted like when you first start eating a bowl of cinnamon toast crunch and the cereal hasn’t had a chance to fully incorporate into the milk yet. The flavor’s there but not quite as pungent as I would’ve liked. ” Legion Whey+ also offers variety for those who get bored of vanilla or chocolate flavors with 16 different flavors available. Legion Whey+ is also third-party tested through Labdoor and produced in facilities that are NSF-certified, FDA-inspected, and GMP-compliant. This helps ensure the purity and quality of the product since supplements aren’t closely regulated. However, when we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity, Legion landed in the top 50 percent of all tested supplements for heavy metals. As such, we graded them a C. Read our full Legion Whey+ Review . This clean, transparent protein powder relies on organic, non-GMO yellow peas for its 20-gram protein dosage. Additionally, the subscription-based model helps ensure you’re always stocked up to help you meet your nutritional goals day in and day out. Ritual Essential Daily Shake 18+ is a clean and traceable plant-based protein shake that’s ideal for vegan diets. First, it’s completely plant-based, while so many options out there are made with whey. Ritual is made with American peas and naturally sweetened with organic monk fruit extract, which has less of an aftertaste than stevia. Second, although pea protein on its own is not complete in the ratios needed to be considered a true “complete protein”, this product contains L-methionine. Complete proteins can be helpful for general wellness since they contain all the amino acids to maintain lean muscle. ( 8 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer, states, “I like the formula’s macro ratio, but I especially like that Ritual added L-methionine to make it a complete protein. Methionine is an essential amino acid, meaning our bodies need it but can’t produce it, so it’s super convenient to get it in your protein powder.” Overall, this formulation scored a 5 out of 5 from our testers. Another important factor for vegans when selecting a protein powder is the consistency and solubility of the shake. Specifically, many vegan protein shakes are clumpy and don’t mix well, which can be a challenge for meeting protein needs. However, this pick seems to boast a smooth consistency and texture. “ This has a shockingly great consistency. Mixed in water, it dissolves, and it also has a really smooth texture. It’s not thick, but it’s not watery like some proteins are,” our tester states. Overall, we scored this product a 5 out of 5 for solubility. This pick is also third-party tested through Informed Sport, so you can trust its purity and quality  – which is important since supplements are not regulated by the FDA. There’s also a certificate of traceability on this specific product that you can find on the Ritual website. [Related: Best Clean Protein Powders ] NOW Sports Certified Organic Whey Protein only contains one ingredient: unflavored whey protein concentrate. It’s extensively third-party tested and is a cost-effective option for athletes. If you’re looking for an unflavored, organic whey protein powder that is well-suited for athletes, look no further. It contains a single ingredient: organic whey protein concentrate. No fluff. Those looking for an unflavored protein powder might be looking for an easy product to integrate into recipes, and this unflavored product fits the bill from a taste perspective. Our tester states, “ If you want something to make smoothies with or bake with, I think this is a good option. It doesn’t have a taste that would overpower any other flavors you use it with .” However, if you’re a protein powder flavor enthusiast, this product may not be the best choice for you – our tester rated its plain taste a 3 out of 5. Mixability is also equally important for an unflavored protein powder so that you don’t end up with clumps in the recipe. “ No issues blending — in a shaker cup by itself, it dissolves pretty well. And then in a blender you don’t notice it at all ,” our tester adds, giving the product a 5 out of 5 for solubility. Additionally, NOW Sports Certified Organic Whey Protein is third-party tested through Informed Sport, and is certified USDA Organic. The Informed Sport certification is particularly important in the world of sports nutrition, since it checks the product for over 220 banned substances that might prohibit an athlete from competing in their sport. You can even view the testing results online. This product is also produced in a GMP facility, which means that it has been tested for stability, potency, and product formulation. [Related: How Much Protein Do You Actually Need Per Day? ] This plant-based shake boasts 140 calories, 20 grams of protein, and an ample amount of the antioxidants Vitamins A, C, and D — which help boost your immune system and fight inflammation. Vega One Organic All-in-One Shake is safe for gluten-free diets , as it has avoided cross-contamination with wheat allergens during its production process. Adhering to a gluten-free diet through consuming naturally gluten-free foods and certified processed gluten-free products is critical for those living with celiac disease or are sensitive to gluten. ( 11 ) It’s also packed with nutritious, gluten-free ingredients. BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois scored the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “Vega One Organic All-In-One Shake is a plant-based protein powder that prioritizes whole food ingredients to provide a hefty dose of protein and other nutrients in every scoop,” she says. “It boasts an impressive ingredient profile. With ingredients like sprouted quinoa, a fruit and veggie blend, and pea protein, it’s rich in fiber and many important vitamins.” [Related: High-Protein Vegetables ] This pick can also help support digestion for those with celiac disease who are looking for digestion-friendly products. First, it contains probiotics ( Bacillus subtilis ), which can help promote a more balanced microbiome. ( 12 ) “ I also love that it contains probiotics to support a healthy gut ,” Bourgeois adds. It would be helpful to know the probiotics concentration in this product, but it was not noted anywhere on the label. Second, it also contains 6 grams of fiber, which is helpful in meeting your daily dietary fiber needs of 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men according to the USDA Dietary Guidelines. ( 13 ) According to our testers, Vega One Organic All-in-One Shake also scored pretty high in taste with a score of 4 out of 5 and solubility, with a score of 4 out of 5. However, it tends to be on the pricier side, so if you’re not strictly adhering to a gluten-free diet, you might be able to find better options on this list that fit your needs. Read our full Vega One Organic All-in-One Shake Review . Garden of Life Raw Organic Whey Protein offers 21 grams of whey protein sourced from American Humane Certified grass-fed cows, as well as 2 billion CFU of probiotics to help aid digestion. If you’re looking for an organic protein powder for weight loss , Garden of Life Raw Organic Whey Protein checks off all the boxes: solid macronutrient profile, low in calories, and contains 2 billion CFUs of probiotics ( Bifidobacterium lactis ). First, this pick is high in protein with 21 grams of protein, low in fat with 2 grams of fat, and low in fat with 6 grams of carbs – making it a great macronutrient profile for those looking to lose weight. Many people with a weight loss goal follow a higher protein diet with lower fat and carb content, so this pick fits those criteria. ( 14 ) According to Garden of Life, their organic, grass-fed whey protein is cold-processed, which maintains the structure and integrity of the essential amino acids instead of denaturing them in the production process. Second, digestion support is important for those looking to lose weight. Probiotics are helpful for promoting a healthy gut, and this pick supplies 2 billion CFUs of probiotics. ( 12 ) Emerging research also shows that gut bacteria may play a role in weight loss. ( 15 ) However, for weight loss purposes, it would have been nice for this product to contain a little bit more dietary fiber to support satiety and digestion. [Related: Best Probiotic Supplements ] Third, this product is fairly low in calories with 120 calories per serving. People with a weight loss goal are looking for a calorie deficit, so having a lower calorie count from a protein supplement can be helpful. Additionally, we like this Garden of Life offering due to its transparency and purity. We worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity, and Garden of Life landed in the top 10 percent overall, earning an A. Taste is also an important consideration when you’re trying to lose weight but consume foods that taste good. “ The taste was earthy, but less so when mixed with any kind of milk, ” our tester notes, giving it an overall 3.5 out of 5. It also received a solid solubility score of 4 out of 5. With one billion colony forming units (CFUs) of probiotics, Pure Food's vegan protein powder should be your pick for more optimal gut health. This powder also contains 20 grams of protein and four grams of BCAAs. Looking for an organic protein shake that also supplies probiotics? Check out Pure Food Plant-Based Protein powder. This product contains 1 billion CFUs of probiotics and a highly digestible amino acid profile to support individuals who are looking for a protein shake for digestive support. Probiotics are helpful for promoting a healthy gut, as they help provide good bacteria to your gut microbiome. ( 12 ) [Related: Best Probiotic Supplements for Women ] However, given that many individuals choose this product for its probiotic content and for digestive support, it could also benefit from the addition of more dietary fiber and digestive enzymes to provide further digestive support. ( 4 ) Its current formulation only contains 3 grams of fiber, while the USDA recommendation for fiber is 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. ( 13 ) You could certainly mix this powder into a smoothie with some fruits and chia seeds for extra fiber content, though. It mixes well in water or in a smoothie, with a solubility score of 4 out of 5. Pure Food Plant-Based Protein Powder also doesn’t have enough protein per serving for it to be a standalone protein shake, with only 10-11 grams of protein per serving. It’s also low in calories at 60-85 calories per serving. Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., R.D.N., L.D. states, “ I’d recommend individuals to add other ingredients to bulk up its nutrition profile .” Overall, our tester scored this product a 3.5 out of 5 for its formulation. Read our full Pure Food Plant-Based Protein Powder Review . While the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for a sedentary adult is about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, individuals may need more protein depending on their activity level and goals. ( 13 ) For example, some recent research points to higher protein needs of up to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight when you’re trying to build lean muscle mass. ( 5 ) These are the individuals who will reap the most health benefits of organic protein powders. Organic protein powders can be a convenient and concentrated source of protein for people looking to build muscle and support muscle recovery after exercise. These benefits of protein supplementation apply whether you’re an active individual or a competitive athlete. Protein powders are helpful because they’re rich in essential amino acids – and amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Protein intake can promote muscle protein synthesis by reversing the muscle damage caused by exercise and promoting the growth of new muscle tissue. ( 1 )( 2 ) Protein powders are a versatile and convenient way to supplement your diet and meet your protein intake goals with additional protein without having to consume a lot more food. Whether you’re looking to increase your protein intake due to higher activity levels, training for a marathon, or looking for strength gains, taking a protein supplement can help you meet your goals. A 2023 study found that supplementing with protein may help reduce body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and percentage of body fat in participants. These results suggest that meeting protein goals through foods and protein supplements can be an effective strategy for weight management and improving overall metabolic health. ( 16 ) However, remember that protein supplements are intended to supplement, not replace. When possible, individuals should aim to obtain nutrients from whole food sources as they provide a wider range of essential nutrients such as dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, that are beneficial to meeting your nutrient needs. Whole foods also contain other macronutrients beyond just protein to help achieve a balance of carbs, fat, and protein. Protein has a more significant satiety effect than fats and carbohydrates. ( 17 ) This means that you’ll feel fuller for longer between meals if you incorporate protein into your diet. Results from a 2022 study showed that a high-protein diet was more effective than a low-protein diet in promoting weight loss by reducing food intake due to a higher satiety index. ( 18 ) Protein also has a higher thermic effect of food (TEF) than carbohydrates and fats. This means that a more significant proportion of the calories from protein are used in the process of digesting and metabolizing the protein rather than being stored as fat. This higher TEF of protein can lead to increased energy expenditure, which better supports weight loss goals. [Related: Best Supplements for Weight Loss ] When taking into consideration what organic protein powders cost, it’s important to look at the price per serving rather than the price per tub or price per scoop. That’s because different tubs have different numbers of servings – and a serving can be a single scoop or multiple scoops depending on the product. To look at the cost per serving, you’ll need to compare the cost of the container to the number of servings that the tub contains. For organic protein powders, the cost ranges from $1 to $4 per serving depending on the brand and ingredients. The cost per serving for an organic protein powder can depend on the protein source, amount of protein per serving, and presence of added ingredients (digestive enzymes, probiotics, micronutrients). Certain organic protein powders that meet specific dietary needs can also command a higher price. Ultimately, you should choose the protein powder that best fits your specific needs and preferences – and that choice will look different from person to person. Making an informed choice can be tough when there are so many options for organic protein powders. While we’ve done our best to compile a comprehensive list for you, here are some considerations when you’re at the shelf or browsing for an organic protein powder that isn’t on this list. When you’re checking out an organic protein powder, the nutrition label is top priority. This is where you can really assess whether it’s the right fit for you. First, take a close look at the protein content per serving. This is crucial if you’re trying to build muscle or support recovery from workouts. According to the USDA Dietary Guidelines, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for a sedentary adult is about 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight – so this means you’ll want a high-quality protein supplement that provides at least 18 to 24 grams of protein if you’re consuming it in place of a meal or between meals, to meet your total protein needs. ( 13 ) Next, take a look at the overall calorie count. This is important if you’re closely monitoring your intake to gain, lose, or maintain weight. The goal here is to find a powder that fits your goal of calorie surplus, deficit, or maintenance. [Related: Calories In, Calories Out; Myth or Truth for Weight Loss? ] Then, review the fat and carb content – these are the rest of the macronutrients, or nutrients that your body uses in the largest amounts. You’ll ideally want a product with lower fat and lower carb content for a good macronutrient balance. And don’t forget about those all-important micronutrients. Some powders are fortified with additional vitamins and minerals, which can be beneficial if you’re not getting enough of those essential nutrients from your regular diet or if you’re following a vegetarian or vegan diet. For example, micronutrients like calcium and vitamin D can help reduce bone density loss and keep your bones strong. ( 19 )( 20 ) And, iron can help improve iron status in individuals who are at-risk for iron deficiency anemia, which is a common health concern for plant-based diets. ( 6 ) Once you’ve reviewed the nutrition panel, take a deeper dive into the ingredient list. You really want to see a clean, straightforward, and short list – this means no sketchy fillers or artificial additives that don’t add any real value. “Organic” is a good starting point for a protein supplement, but don’t assume that means it’s healthier or completely free of additional ingredients than other products. ( 21 ) Organic simply means that the product is prepared without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or other artificial agents. We’ve seen several organic protein powders that still contain fillers. Fillers are any ingredients that aren’t associated with the protein source but also don’t add any value.  Examples include preservatives, bulking agents like maltodextrin, corn syrup, or cornstarch, and even fats or sugars. Manufacturers also sometimes sneak in ingredients like artificial sweeteners or flavors to enhance the taste and texture. But, those don’t align with the goal of a high-quality, nutritious supplement and may not align with your preferences if you prefer natural ingredients. Instead, look for powders that use simple, recognizable ingredients that actually boost the nutritional profile, like organic cocoa or natural vanilla. These additions can provide great flavor without compromising the integrity of the product. You’ll want to assess whether the protein powder meets your specific dietary needs and lifestyle preferences. Are you following a vegan or plant-based diet? Make sure the protein source is plant-based, like pea or rice protein. If you are relying on protein powder as a primary protein source, make sure the source ideally has several protein sources to make up a “complete protein” – which means it contains all essential amino acids . Dealing with any food allergies or intolerances? Check for certifications that show that it’s free of common allergens like soy, nuts, or gluten. Think about what your individual health goals are. Are you looking to build muscle? Support energy levels? Complement a keto diet? Different protein powders are formulated to cater to different needs, so find one that aligns well with your personal objectives. Since the supplement industry isn’t as regulated by the FDA as we might hope, third-party certifications become incredibly important when selecting a protein powder to check for purity and safety. These independent organizations like the USDA for organic certification or NSF for overall safety standards put the products through rigorous testing. They check things like whether the ingredients truly match what’s listed, if the product is free from harmful contaminants, and if the manufacturing processes meet high-quality standards. [Related: Dirty Bulking Vs. Clean Bulking — How Do You Want to Get Big? ] These certifications give you that extra layer of assurance that what you’re consuming is safe and as natural as advertised. You don’t want to risk ingesting anything questionable, especially when it comes to a supplement you’re relying on to support your health and fitness goals. The third-party stamps of approval are like a seal of trustworthiness. Of course, once you’ve narrowed down the options based on the nutrition profile and ingredient quality, there are a few more practical factors to consider. If important to you, consider the price per serving, mixability, and taste reviews when choosing a product. First, take a look at the price per serving. The most expensive powder isn’t necessarily the best – you want to find that sweet spot of quality and value. Budgets vary, so find one that fits your spending parameters without sacrificing the nutritional benefits. Mixability is another important factor, especially if you plan to blend the powder into smoothies or shakes regularly. You don’t want a gritty, clumpy mess – look for reviews that highlight how smoothly it mixes into different liquids including water, milk, and non-dairy beverages. And finally, taste is crucial. If you don’t enjoy the flavor, you’re much less likely to stick with it in the long run. Some people prefer a neutral, unflavored powder, while others enjoy something a little sweeter. Reading taste reviews can give you a good sense of whether the flavor profile aligns with your personal preferences. Or, if you can find a single pack of a protein powder you’ve been wanting to try, you can see if you like it before you buy a whole tub. Yes, organic protein powders can be healthy. While organic protein powders are not inherently healthier for you than conventional protein powders from a nutritional standpoint, most of our picks in this review have a balanced macronutrient profile and are great for everyday use. Organic protein powders can range quite a bit in price depending on your specific needs. The cheapest organic protein powders can cost as low as $1.16 per serving and are a great value for your money, like the Jacked Factory Authentic Vegan protein on our list. The more expensive organic protein powders can cost as much as $4.29 per serving, like the Vega One Organic All-in-One-Shake. We recommend that you weigh your specific needs against the cost to see if a specific product is worth it. While what’s considered the best organic protein powder is subjective, we like Transparent Labs Vegan Protein for its high protein count, solid dose of iron, and clean formulation. It’s also gluten-free and non-GMO. Billy Brown is a former senior editor at Fatherly.com and has contributed to Men’s Journal, Esquire, WIRED, Outside Magazine, and Backpacker.

    "text": "Meat-eaters and plant-based eaters don’t always have much in common when it comes to what’s on their plates, but one fact remains — both need protein. As Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD puts it, “Protein is critical for every single cell in the body, serving as a building block for muscle, hair, skin, nails, and connective tissue.” For athletes, many can turn to the best protein powders for quick, convenient macronutrient intake. The best vegan protein powders help open the doors to helpful supplementation for plant-based individuals, too, with vital vitamins, minerals, and amino acids often left underserved by whole-food options. Like any protein supplement, though, finding the right plant-based protein powder goes beyond your flavor of choice. You’ll want a supplement that’s independently tested for purity and label accuracy, as well as one that can deliver the proper goods when it comes to macro and micronutrients. Rather than leaving you to your own devices and challenging Google searches, our team of experts and fitness enthusiasts has combed through over 100 samples of high-quality protein powders, using our supplement testing methodology to rate and examine top options in categories such as: The BarBend team has helped connect over 1.6 million athletes with high-quality nutrition products and supplements. If you’re on the hunt for some of the best plant-based protein on the market today, we’re confident that the following details can help you shake up your supplement regimen for the better. Now, grab your trusty shaker cup and let’s get into our findings.

A surprisingly delicious vegan protein powder that’s totally free from artificial ingredients and soy, Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Protein contains a 2:1 ratio of rice to pea protein powder, and four grams of fiber. If you’re in the market for some of the best organic protein powder , this option from Transparent Labs is our overall top vegan protein. This non-whey protein powder uses organic rice and pea protein, helping craft a complete amino acid profile vital for muscle protein synthesis. ( 14 ) Plus, organic pea protein isolate is high in branched-chain amino acids, which can be beneficial for post-workout recovery. ( 11 ) As such, we score the formulation at 4 out of 5. In addition to the 24 grams of protein per scoop — and up to 3 grams of fat as well as 6 grams of carbs — Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD appreciates the inclusion of iron in the Chocolate makeup. It also has zero artificial sweeteners or artificial flavors. “ I love that Transparent Labs keeps the ingredients list short with their Organic Vegan protein powder . You get 24 grams of high-quality , plant-based protein without any unnecessary fluff,” Bourgeois says. “ Plus, you get 15% of your daily iron needs when you choose the Chocolate flavor .” As far as taste and solubility, this Transparent Labs offering gave our tester, a certified nutrition coach, a bit of a struggle. “I noticed a unique smell when mixing this powder. It’s not as if the powder has gone bad, but it’s somewhat off-putting,” they note. “The French Vanilla has got more of an artificial taste than I’d expect, ” one tester says. On the other hand, another tester had the Chocolate variety and said, “ It’s only got a hint of earthiness; mostly it’s like a dark chocolate drink. It might not be your favorite if you love extra sweet drinks, but it’s not bad!” The entire mixing process created a good bit of foam, as well. We score Organic Vegan at 2.5 out of 5 for taste and 3.75 out of 5 for solubility. For a protein powder that features no mixing qualms, consider Legion Plant+. A final note regarding this organic vegan protein powder is its reliance on stevia as a sweetening agent. Stevia can potentially lead to gastrointestinal distress in sensitive stomachs, which our tester experienced after trialing this powder for some time. ( 1 ) Be sure to take into account your own stomach limits before ordering a tub of this powder for your own routine. Read our full Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Review . Legion’s Plant+ has 25 grams of protein per serving, just four grams of carbs, and is packed with vitamins and minerals that plant-based eaters may want more of. For athletes with fat loss in mind, we recommendLegion’s Plant+ Plant Protein Powder. The high-protein, low-carb, and low-fat split can make it easier when trying to learn how to count your macros , according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. The maximum 140 calories per serving can be helpful, too, for athletes looking to support their strength-gaining goals without excess weight gain. While we like the macro breakdown for those following a calorie deficit , the formula does leave a little to be desired. “Legion Plant+ protein powder scores a 3.75 out of 5 for its formulation,” according to Bourgeois. “The major deductions stem from its sodium content and limited vitamin and mineral profile.” Our testers do like the flavor variety, though. “I tried the Apple Pie flavor and it was sweeter than I expected with a little artificial taste,” our tester, a certified personal trainer, says in reference to their 4-out-of-5 taste rating. The six available flavors is one of the largest rosters we’ve seen with plant-based protein powders. Taste fiends should also consider Gainful Vegan Protein and the formulation’s unique “flavor booster” packs. And don’t worry: it goes well with oat milk. “It was a normal thickness, kind of like what you’d expect with milk. I think it’s the creaminess of oat milk that really helped that along.” While the presence of stevia can lead to gastrointestinal distress for some, we didn’t really experience any unwanted side effects. However, we understand that reactions can be highly subjective between athletes, so we conservatively rate this Legion offering at 4.5 out of 5 out of the potential for side effects. ( 1 ) This product is also processed in a facility that handles known allergens, so be sure to read the warning labels. Read our full Legion Plant+ Protein Review . This clean, transparent protein powder relies on organic, non-GMO yellow peas for its 20-gram protein dosage. Additionally, the subscription-based model helps ensure you’re always stocked up to help you meet your nutritional goals day in and day out. For vegan athletes wanting a completely organic protein powder with an enjoyable flavor profile, Ritual’s Daily Essential Shake 18+ is one of our favorites. It features an organic pea protein foundation to deliver 20 grams of a complete amino acid profile. ( 13 ) We also love that this protein is fully vetted and tested. Not only does this plant-based protein carry approval from the Clean Label Project, but each ingredient is also completely traceable back to its source — similar to the brand’s other best multivitamins and pregnancy-oriented products. “I’m a huge fan of companies that are transparent with their formulas, and Ritual’s got that down to a science,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD. After analyzing the label, Bourgeois scores the formulation at 4.5 out of 5, thanks to its clean ingredients and complete protein makeup. The half-point deduction is for the sodium content, which is a bit high. Kate Meier, BarBend editorial member and NASM-Certified Personal Trainer, scores the solubility at 5 out of 5, stating, “I mixed my vanilla flavor sample with just water and was pleasantly surprised by the smooth texture. The powder dissolved easily in my shaker bottle, and I didn’t experience any clumps or floating residue.” This product is only offered as a Vanilla vegan protein powder, so there is less flavor variety with this protein option. However, we found Essential Daily Shake 18+ to be tasty enough for repeated consumption, scoring it at 4.5 out of 5 for the category. “With just water alone, this is still super creamy and doesn’t have any of those weird aftertastes you get with some more artificial powders ,” another tester comments. “I love that it didn’t taste like the stereotypical earthiness of other plant-based powders.” That said, though, a single flavor option can begin to become repetitive and dull over time. For those in need of different tastes every now and again, consider something like Legion Plant+. The one major issue we have with this vegan protein option is the price per serving. At $3.27 per dose, it’s well beyond the $1 to $2 average. Add in, too, that each container only features 15 servings, and you can expect a good amount of repeat orders. Transparent Labs Vegan Mass Gainer is ideal for athletes following a plant-based diet who also want to put on some mass. This supplement is made with a pea protein isolate and zero animal products. Plant-based bodybuilding is definitely becoming more prevalent, and Transparent Labs Vegan Mass Gainer definitely makes bulking a little easier when trying to account for how much protein you need to support your physique. This formula features 730 calories per serving, including 52 grams of protein, 115 grams of carbs, and 10 grams of fat per serving. While it has enough macronutrients to be a stand-alone meal, it isn’t created to balance all the necessary micronutrients within a meal. Thanks to the artificial-ingredient-free formula, we give the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. If you’re looking for a plant-based meal replacement with fewer calories, consider something like Ka’Chava Meal Replacement . We also love that this mass gainer boasts 70% of your daily iron needs. While you can definitely get plenty of iron from plant-based foods, it is a little trickier when avoiding meat. ( 15 ) Luckily, this formula helps fill that potential gap in your daily diet. “If you’re prone to iron deficiency, that could be an added bonus for you, too,” notes registered dietitian nutritionist and BarBend expert reviewer, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. Unfortunately, though, TL’s Vegan Mass Gainer is only offered in two flavors. That said, one of our testers tried out the Chocolate Glaze Donut flavor and was actually surprised by the accuracy. “After trying it a few times, I’d say it really tasted like a donut,” they note, giving the flavor a 4 out of 5. As with most other Transparent Labs products, our testers are pretty happy with the solubility, too. The powder dissolves pretty seamlessly in our testers’ shaker cups without any noticeable clumping at the bottom. Transparent Labs Vegan Mass Gainer is third-party lab tested. However, we do wish the brand specified by whom. We also think the price point is a little hard to swallow (pun intended). Though the $5.33 per serving price tag is pretty common amongst mass gainers , it’s definitely more expensive than the other protein powders on this list, earning a 2 out of 5 for cost. Onnit’s plant-based protein powder is made of a blend of pea, pumpkin, sunflower seed, and watermelon seed proteins. This one is available in two separate flavors, too, including Chocolate and Vanilla. Compared to protein products like whey or casein, vegan proteins aren’t typically known as the best-tasting protein powders . Many have a slight earthiness to them, which is understandable considering that most of the ingredients are, well, from the Earth. However, we didn’t have that problem with Onnit’s Plant-Based Protein during our trials. Our tester, a certified nutrition coach, rates the taste at 4.75 out of 5, stating, “My Chocolate sample was akin to my favorite ( dairy-free ) chocolate milk. The taste was rich and enjoyable — a true treat when compared to other plant-based powders I’ve consumed in the past.” The formulation of this tasty vegan option is also impressive. We rated the makeup at 4 out of 5 as it blends various plant protein sources for 20 grams of protein per dose. It includes a full amino acid profile rich with EAAs and BCAAs, too, including 2,270 milligrams of leucine — one of the most important BCAAs for muscle growth. ( 12 ) “Onnit’s plant-based protein powder is comparable to the brand’s grass-fed whey formula in terms of nutrition facts. Each serving provides 20 grams of protein , with an impressive amino acid profile, as well,” adds registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. Other plant-based options with full amino acid profiles include Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Plant-Based Protein Isolate as well as Ritual Essential Daily Shake 18+. “I did experience a slightly gritty texture, but nothing that wasn’t out of the ordinary,” our tester says, rating this powder a 4.25 out of 5 for solubility. Overall, though, there were no real issues with the powder clumping or settling. Onnit’s Plant-Based Protein costs $2.25 per serving, which is slightly more expensive than the $1 to $2 average of other vegan protein supplements in the category. However, Onnit does offer a subscription service that can add a 15% discount to your order. If you’re looking for a convenient means to stay stocked up on this tasty powder, we recommend considering the subscription platform. Read our full Onnit Plant-Based Protein Review . Gainful Plant-Based Protein Powder offers 23 grams of organic brown rice and pea protein, which delivers a complete amino acid profile. Plus, available flavor packs help craft a unique menu across your weekly supplement schedule. “Active individuals such as athletes will need to consume higher counts of protein throughout the day to account for greater caloric burn during activities and sports,” states Dr. Christopher Mohr, PhD, RD. We recommend Gainful Everyday Plant Protein for athletes because there are 23 grams of organic brown rice and pea protein per serving, which means there is a complete amino acid profile present, too. ( 13 ) Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN also appreciates this complete yet well-rounded makeup, rating the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “I like that it’s unsweetened and free from artificial ingredients, too,” she adds. We personally tested Gainful protein for both taste and solubility to see how it fits within our vegan diets for athletes . One interesting aspect of Gainful compared to other vegan protein powders is that it comes unflavored, but there are a number of flavor boosters you can choose from to add to your protein — think of them as sugar packets for your morning coffee. “The cool thing here is that you’ve got little flavor packs instead of a whole tub with just one flavor,” our tester says in reference to their 5-out-of-5 taste rating. “That means you’re basically banned from getting bored.” When it comes to solubility, we had mixed results, but still find Gainful to be at or above average. “ I was shocked at the ease with which the shaker cup mixed the product. Within about 30 seconds, the powder was blended ,” our testers say. They do note that using a blender will increase solubility, though, as a shaker cup alone left some clumps. They rate Gainful a 3 out of 5 for solubility. For easier mixing protocols, consider Ritual Daily Essential Shake 18+, which scored a perfect 5 out of 5 for the category. Athletes should keep in mind that there are only about 120 calories per serving with this Gainful option. That can be great for those looking to lose weight, but for those looking to gain muscle, it may be wise to mix this protein into a smoothie with additional fruit and vegetables. Read our full Gainful Protein Powder Review . Bulk Supplements Soy Protein Isolate is made with 100% plant-based protein, so it’s vegan-friendly. For your convenience, you can also choose from several bulk purchase options. It can be helpful to have an unflavored powder for smoothies or baking when trying to figure out how to eat more protein throughout the day, as there’s less of a chance of the powder altering your food’s overall taste. This Soy Protein Isolate from Bulk Supplements is our top unflavored choice since it can be easily added to a smoothie, shake, pre-workout, or post-workout blend without giving your palate a displeasing sensation. Accordingly, taste (or lack thereof) earns a 4 out of 5. Soy Protein Isolate is also a fairly clean formulation, which we rated at 4.5 out of 5. There aren’t any added sugars, additives, dairy, or even gluten across the ingredients list. “I love the simplicity of this soy protein formula.” states registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “It includes soy protein and that’s it, making it an ideal option for those who follow a plant-based diet ! And with no fat and almost zero carbs , it’s a lean way to increase your protein intake .” We also like this best clean protein powder example thanks to its low cost per serving, earning a 5 out of 5 for value. You can pick up this tasteless protein powder for roughly $0.45 per serving, depending on your chosen container size, which is well below the average $1 to $2 associated with other high-quality vegan protein powders. That said, though, the convenience factor is sort of lost beyond the wallet-friendly price tag. “Bulk Supplements doesn’t include a scoop with this Soy Protein Isolate, so you’ll need to provide your own tablespoon to achieve optimal dosages,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer. “Also, I advise that you carefully open the bag until you’ve worked through roughly half of the powder — you could be left with some unwanted protein dust that can dirty up your counters in a hurry.” If traditional tubs (with included scoopers) are more your speed, consider a different option like Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Plant-Based Protein Isolate. Orgain Organic Protein Plant Based Powder offers 21 grams of protein per serving, along with 5 grams of fiber and net carbs! You don’t need to pay an arm and a leg for the best plant-based protein powders. There are still some options that rival the best protein powders in terms of cost, including Orgain’s Organic Vegan Protein Powder. While the price per serving is in line with the average $1 to $2 cost of other supplements in the category, this powder earns our “Best Budget” moniker due to its impressive subscription option that can save athletes 15% off their orders. Other proteins typically offer a 5% or 10% discount for such services. “ Orgain Plant-Based Protein is a pretty lean protein powder,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gives the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “I like that it helps you boost your protein intake without significantly affecting your other macros or overall calorie intake. I also love its versatility. It’s gluten-free , vegan, Kosher-friendly, and made with soy-free ingredients, meaning it can fit into many diets.” In addition to the cost-saving benefits of this Orgain offering, we also appreciate the 12 flavor options that offer plenty of variety from one order to the next. Overall, we rate the taste at 4 out of 5 thanks to the plethora of palate-pleasing tastes offered across the lineup — there’s practically a flavor for every taste bud, which can go a long way in fighting flavor fatigue over time. “I tossed the Creamy Chocolate Fudge with frozen bananas, spinach, almond butter, and oat milk. It was delightful, and it was also really good with just water or milk. A pleasant surprise!” As far as the solubility, we score this organic protein powder at 3 out of 5, due, in part, to its two scoops of powder per serving. No matter how you slice it, this can be an abundance of powder to try and dissolve with a shaker bottle alone. For less powder per serving, consider a protein like Legion Plant+ or Gainful Everyday Plant Protein. Read our full Orgain Organic Vegan Protein Powder Review . With one billion colony forming units (CFUs) of probiotics, Pure Food’s vegan protein powder should be your pick for more optimal gut health. This powder also contains 20 grams of protein and four grams of BCAAs. Yes, the best probiotic supplements can do wonders for your gut microbiome, but having a hearty dose of probiotics in your dairy-free protein powder can be a more convenient way to target your digestion, gut health, immune function, and metabolic health in the long run. ( 13 ) While it’s not uncommon to see proteins with probiotics added to the formulation, this option from Pure Food is one of our favorites, thanks to its serving of GanedenBC30 ( Bacillus coagulans) probiotic featured in each dosage (plus, it’s a generally clean vegan protein powder, too). We also like the approachable price point, rating the value at 4.5 out of 5 given its wallet-friendly $1.23 cost per serving. This can be especially helpful since there is only one 32-serving container size available, meaning that repeat orders are practically a necessity if you plan to continue your supplement routine longer than one month. Pure Food Plant-Based Protein Powder is also fairly lean at a maximum 62 calories per serving, which can be great for athletes focused on weight loss. However, we do wish the formulation would include a higher protein count per dosage. “You really need to mix it with other ingredients to bulk up its nutrition profile,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, M.S., RDN, LD, giving the formulation a 3.75 out of 5. In terms of flavor variety, Pure Food keeps it simple with just two tastes to choose from — Vanilla and Chocolate. According to our tester, who scores the flavor at 4 out of 5, “The Vanilla offering actually tastes like vanilla — a nice reprieve from nuttier options I’ve tested in the past.” Naturally, though, some may prefer some added variety, especially when trying to mix up the menu after weeks with the same profile. For more flavor options, consider plant-based proteins like Orgain Organic Vegan Protein Powder or Legion Plant+. Read our full Pure Food Plant-Based Protein Powder Review . This impressive protein powder packs in 20 grams of plant-based protein alongside whole-food ingredients such as broccoli, kale, alfalfa, and more to create a daily greens-protein powder hybrid supplement. Despite this unique combination, Vega Protein & Greens delivers exceptional flavor that’s enjoyable enough for daily consumption. The best greens powders can be helpful supplements for your daily needs, with studies showcasing their potential benefits for immune health and gut health. ( 21 ) While it may seem off-putting to combine your greens with a vegan protein powder, Vega’s Protein & Greens formulation comes together surprisingly well in its effort to deliver real-food ingredients alongside 20 grams of protein. Plus, our tester, a certified personal trainer, enjoys the flavor profile of this unique concoction. “I was pleasantly surprised by the chocolate taste of this powder, which had this earthy vibe similar to a high-end cocoa,” our tester states in reference to their 5-out-of-5 taste rating. “While I’d be hesitant to mix my normal protein and greens together, I could easily see myself having this as a morning beverage.” Vega Protein & Greens includes whole-food and superfood ingredients such as broccoli, kale, alfalfa, and others across its ingredients list and uses a blend of pea protein and organic brown rice protein for a more complete amino acid profile. Additionally, the formulation is certified vegan and non-GMO verified. As a certified nutrition coach, though, I score the formulation at 4 out of 5 given its use of stevia as a sweetening agent. Stevia may cause gastrointestinal distress in some athletes, so it’s imperative you take your personal sensitivities into question prior to purchase. ( 1 ) This greens-packed protein powder can be blended in multiple fashions, and the packaging includes instructions for every method you’re likely to use at home. Per our testers, though, it may be most effective to use one of your best shaker bottles to craft your daily drink. “The gritty texture is unavoidable due to the added greens ,” our tester notes. “But I strongly recommend using a shaker bottle or motorized blender. Stirring this powder with a spoon was quite the chore.” As such, we rate the solubility at 4 out of 5, and recommend an easier-mixing protein like Ritual Essential Daily Shake 18+ for those in need of a spoon-ready makeup. NOW Sports Soy Protein Isolate is an unflavored soy protein powder that can be quickly added to smoothies and other recipes. Non-GMO soy protein isolate is the lone ingredient, too, so there’s no questions surrounding unwanted fillers, artificial sweeteners, or other unnecessary additions you may find in other protein supplements. Don’t let the rumors fool you — the relationship between soy and strength athletes can be positive as studies report that soy protein has no effect on testosterone levels. ( 10 ) For plant-based athletes considering soy protein powder, this NOW Sports offering is our top recommendation thanks to its approachable pricing, simple ingredients list, and excellent solubility. In looking at NOW Sports Soy Protein Isolate, you’ll only find one ingredient — non-GMO soy protein isolate. This eliminates any questions surrounding unwanted additives, and allows for quick understanding of what, exactly, is in each serving. As a certified nutrition coach, I appreciate the down-to-earth structure of this powder without unnecessary fillers and rate the formulation at 4 out of 5. That said, those wanting a higher caloric count per serving may prefer Bulk Supplements Soy Protein Isolate and its 110 calories — this NOW Sports option has only 90. While the unflavored makeup of this best soy protein powder does open doors to include it in multiple recipes, our tester, a certified nutrition coach, rates the taste at 3 out of 5. “It’s not something I’d reach for on its own,” they state. “But I do appreciate how easily it can be added to smoothies and other recipes without altering the flavor profile.” NOW Sports Soy Protein Isolate can be found on multiple third-party retail sites, but we recommend purchasing the powder on Amazon to get the best deal, which equates to $0.95 per serving. This is below the $1 to $2 average we’ve found in other vegan protein powders, so we’re happy to score this NOW Sports offering at 5 out of 5 for value. Lastly, our tester notes that mixing up NOW Sports Soy Protein Isolate is a simple endeavor. “I had no issues with clumps or residue when adding it to my shaker cup,” they add. “I do caution, though, that the powder can foam up slightly if shaken aggressively, and expect to give your bottle a few tumbles if you let the beverage sit for an extended period.” As such, we rate the solubility at 4 out of 5. The BarBend team is made up of competitive athletes, certified personal trainers, and lifelong fitness enthusiasts. To determine the best vegan protein powders available today, we’ve tested nearly 100 different profiles from the industry’s best brands, using our supplement testing methodology to rate each profile on a scale of 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Below are some of the categories and components that played into our rankings. If you eat a plant-based diet, you’ll need to be extra conscious of your protein intake. Alongside boosting your protein intake, there are several benefits of vegan protein powders. Vegan protein powders aren’t all made from the same sources. Here’s a breakdown of the four most common vegan protein powder sources. This protein source derived from peas is one of the newer types of protein to hit the market. Its appeal is that it contains all nine essential amino acids and is considered relatively easy to digest. It’s also effective. One study showed that supplementing with pea protein while on a strength training program significantly increased biceps muscle size as effectively as whey protein. ( 8 )( 14 ) In addition to containing the nine essential amino acids, hemp protein — which is the product of ground-up hemp seeds — also has a solid dose of fiber and healthy fats. Since this type of product is high in fiber, it may help with digestion, but it may also cause gas and bloating in some. ( 9 )( 19 ) Though it’s not a complete protein, brown rice protein is derived from the protein in brown rice and is void of allergens like gluten, soy, eggs, and nuts. It also digests very quickly, especially compared to a whey product that is derived from dairy. ( 18 ) First, if you have a soy allergy, you’ll want to pick another option from this list. That said, for anyone else, soy protein — which is derived from soybeans — is a fine protein option. And though some may try to steer clear thinking it affects your testosterone levels, more recent studies have shown that to be largely untrue. ( 10 ) When choosing which plant-based protein powder to buy, here are some important factors you should consider before making your purchase. Protein content sounds like an obvious consideration, right? Of course, how much protein you need depends on your goals and on other factors, like age, gender, weight, and other medical conditions. For vegans, as we’ve mentioned before, getting enough complete protein in your diet can be a challenge. Athletes may need as much as 1.6 grams or more of protein per kilogram of body weight. ( 3 ) A less intense gym goer who’s trying to keep their nutrition in check may want to pack added protein into their diet as well. On this list, none of the picks dipped below 20 grams of protein per serving, and some options go up to 25 grams. Your caloric intake matters the most when you’re trying to gain or lose weight, but macros matter, too. There are three main macros — protein (which we’ve already covered), carbohydrates, and fat. Carbs essentially give you the energy to work out (though the carbs you don’t burn are stored as fat, so you need to balance these well). Fats generally regulate your hormones, like testosterone and leptin, and fats contribute to a number of other functions in the body as well. When it comes to carving out a more impressive physique, you want your macros dialed in. ( 20 ) One key to managing your macro intake is choosing foods that enable a healthy macro split (depending on your goals). This way, you can better manage your overall intake and create more balanced meals. For example, one Big Mac has 563 calories and 33 grams of fat, 44 grams of carbs, and 26 grams of protein. ( 4 ) For comparable calories, you can have a cup of rice and half a pound of chicken with spinach — a meal that packs 56 grams of protein, 46 grams of carbs, and 7.5 grams of fat. ( 5 )( 6 ) Of course, there are other food options to choose from (even high-protein fast food dishes ). For this reason, we chose vegan protein shakes that had minimal grams of carbs and fat to ensure you were getting mainly protein. There are specific vitamins and nutrients in meat that vegans might not be getting enough of. To recap, those are B12, iron, iodine, zinc, calcium, vitamin D, and long-chain fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA. ( 17 ) For example, vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient that isn’t made by plants, and research shows there is a high rate of deficiency in vegan and vegetarian populations. ( 7 ) The protein powders on this list contain most of the recommended nutrients and vitamins that plant-based eaters want. While protein intake calculators and macronutrient trackers will have you looking mainly at protein, carb, and fat counts across your vegan protein’s supplement facts, it’s also important to look at the other ingredients contained within the formulation. Look for protein sources that craft a complete amino acid profile and be on the lookout for any known allergens you may be sensitive to. If you’re looking for the best protein powders without artificial sweeteners , you’ll also need to look for proteins sweetened with natural ingredients like stevia, monk fruit extract, or erythritol. Be mindful, though, that natural sweeteners such as stevia can lead to GI distress in some, so again, take your stomach’s tendencies into consideration before finalizing your purchase. ( 1 ) Vegan and plant-based protein powders can be excellent supplements for those abstaining from animal-derived proteins, but they aren’t without potential risks. For one, you need to be mindful of the amino acid profile, as some plant-based proteins do not feature all amino acids — a vital precursor to muscle protein synthesis. ( 14 ) Additionally, most vegan proteins can be higher in fiber than whey proteins or other animal-derived supplements. This uptick in dietary fiber can potentially lead to GI distress and symptoms like bloating in more sensitive athletes. Some plant sources, such as soy, are also known allergens, making them less than ideal for athletes with these identified allergies. Finally, while not a risk specific to plant-based proteins, some supplements can contain high counts of heavy metals, phthalates, and other banned substances. Since these products are not regulated by the FDA, brands are not required to list these inclusions across the label’s supplement facts, hence why choosing a vegan protein powder that’s undergone third-party testing from a reputable lab such as Informed Choice or NSF is a near-must-have. If you’re just peeping at the cost of the container before deciding which protein powder is in your price range and which isn’t, you’re not actually getting a sense of how much your powder costs. You want to know how much you are paying per serving and what you’re getting in each scoop, rather than just going for the least expensive jug. A high-quality vegan protein powder can be just as effective as whey. Though good vegan powders are more difficult to find, a pea protein powder or pea protein blend provides the same muscle-building benefits as whey, and in some cases, similar macros as well. ( 8 )( 14 ) Vegan protein powders used to be difficult to find. Nowadays, most supplement companies have a vegan option, and there are a lot of choices. For our money, Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Plant-Based Protein Isolate is our favorite plant-based powder thanks to its third-party tested formulation composed of organic ingredients and high protein count of 24 grams per serving. Additionally, Transparent Labs offers Organic Vegan Plant-Based Protein Isolate through the brand’s subscription-based platform, giving athletes the opportunity to grab discounted price totals for repeat orders. A vegan, lactose-free protein powder can certainly be healthy, depending on the product you choose. Prioritize options that are low in artificial ingredients or sweeteners. ( 1 ) Since vegan protein is derived from plants and plants contain more fiber, some blends can be grittier than animal-based whey proteins. However, the difference is not significant, especially if you blend vegan powder into a smoothie or shake that contains plant-based milk and/or other ingredients. It’s possible for vegans to have nutritional gaps in their diet, and since vegan protein powders often include a lot of these vitamins and minerals (as well as protein), they can be a great option for anyone looking to fill vegan dietary gaps. ( 17 ) In theory, yes. Vegan and plant-based proteins can be effective for muscle-building protocols provided the formulation is a “complete” protein meaning it features all nine essential amino acids — a necessity for muscle protein synthesis.

    "text": "The nutritional supplement market will promise every benefit under the sun to make sales. Many companies cite pre-workouts as the key to unlocking the best parts of your workout regimen , while supplements like mass gainers are hailed as tickets to rapid muscle growth . Your task is to separate the pretenders from the contenders and differentiate between promises and results. When it comes to quality supplements, whey proteins — a staple of many a nutrition plan — are no different from their contemporaries. Whey protein can be one of the more convenient ways to add a massive influx of protein to a diet. For this reason, it can seem like the fitness world makes whey out as its own food group. Before making an informed purchase, you should understand what whey protein is and how effective it can be. Here’s what you should review before making a whey protein a foundation of your nutritional plan . Whey protein is a dairy-based powder supplement typically used to inject a boost of protein into your daily nutrition and, in turn, assist with strength and muscle growth . Whey protein supplements are naturally robust thanks to a mix of proteins isolated from the whey — a byproduct separated from milk during cheese production. For the most part, whey protein has no taste (though, if you prefer a distinct taste , you’ll face no issues), and many people add it to any variety of products like bars, shakes, and even cereals. Let’s diagram what whey proteins have to offer upon closer examination and determine whether adding one to your diet is the right idea. Whey protein shares similarities with its supplement cousins like casein because both come from milk, but whey protein has considerable structural and nutritional differences . Not only does whey generally have more protein content, but it is also absorbed faster by the body because of a distinct amino acid profile. Whey is a “complete” protein source that offers all nine essential amino acids — histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine. These amino acids are considered essential because they aren’t produced by your body and must be ingested via food or supplementation. It’s a vital difference to note, given how important it is to time and consume protein post-workout . Whey protein is desirable because of its high volume of protein — a major building block in muscle-building. A balanced diet is essential to any quality nutrition. But no gymgoer, lifter, or athlete will progress far without consuming a marked supply of protein, which your body needs in spades for recovery and growth. Any protein supplement worth its salt should provide at least 20 grams of protein per serving to reach an appreciable fraction of your total daily intake. That said, larger individuals will generally require more total protein per day , making products with higher grams per serving a bit more valuable. Protein content alone isn’t enough to make one type of whey worthwhile to integrate into a diet. There’s a fine line to walk, depending on the style. Concentrate whey protein supplements are what you’ll most likely run into first when searching for a whey. Popular because of its flavors, up to 80 percent of an average concentrate is pure protein, and it has a higher mix of lactose in comparison to its counterparts. A concentrate will often have more fat, carbohydrates, and calories as well. You can think of whey concentrate as similar to a protein-packed glass of whole milk. Whey isolate is highly refined during its creation, leaving behind little dairy content. If you’re lactose intolerant but still need to get your protein fix in, you’ll likely rejoice at picking up a whey isolate product . Up to 90 percent of most common whey isolates are nothing but protein. Additionally, there’s demonstrably less overall fat and thus calories in most whey isolates, making them an excellent option if you’re happy with your diet plan in general and just need to kick your protein up a notch. A slightly more refined version of an isolate whey, a hydrolysate whey protein has been hydrolyzed, or pre-digested, so the body can absorb its proteins faster. Common hydrolysates might consist of up to 95 percent protein while also holding valuable low-fat and low-calorie marks. While all whey isolate is going to come from milk, clear whey isolate is transparent and goes through an intensive purification process meant to strip it from as much non-protein product as possible. As a result, it is said to be even more friendly to lactose-intolerant people than general whey isolates. Since it’s very highly purified, clear whey isolate is also sought after for a potentially neutral taste and more rapid absorption. While whey proteins are a celebrated means of injecting more protein into a diet, it’s crucial to understand that they’re intended as a supplement . You shouldn’t see this as a replacement for a significant macronutrient in balanced nutrition that buoys an entire workout plan . Your approach should outline where protein fits into your diet and your needs. While whey protein is a rightfully-celebrated means of injecting more dietary protein into a nutritional plan, it’s crucial to understand that it is still a supplement. You shouldn’t see whey as a replacement for a significant portion of your overall nutrient intake . Protein is one of three macronutrients — the other two being carbohydrate and fat — that all have a caloric value. As such, your fitness goals and activity level contribute to how much protein you should consume . Exercise: 15-30 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Intense exercise: 45-120 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Very intense exercise: 2+ hours of elevated heart rate activity. Formulas like these come with some nuance, but the basic idea is simple enough — the more you weigh, the more calories, and thus protein, you’ll need to consume. Since hitting a high daily protein target can be a challenge, whey protein supplements can come in clutch. But as correlation does not always mean causation. More does not always equate to better in every scenario. Putting some protein into your body post-workout is an absolute must for progression and bulking . However, if you’re overeating protein (yes, it’s possible ) and, say, already have unhealthy kidneys, you’re placing your body at risk of further kidney damage or even failure. ( 1 ) Now, that doesn’t mean you should stray away from a whey protein because it might prove to be difficult for your body to filter through. It’s simply crucial to dose whey protein, like any supplement, in the proper proportion to serve your needs. Whey protein supplements have one benefit everyone understands — they are an accessible means of increasing overall protein consumption. A whey protein is practical for anyone following a diligent nutrition plan who may be struggling to build size and muscle , but also earns top marks for convenience and potentially even shedding fat as well. While there is no shortage of choices when it comes to consuming dietary protein, it can take a lot of effort (and time) to consume a requisite amount for your desired gains over an entire day. Whey protein, in that way, is a natural bridge to help push you along. Since whey requires little to no preparation, all you need is a good shaker bottle or blender to get a protein-packed meal in. If you’re someone looking to lose weight and burn fat , it’s hard to go wrong with the addition of whey protein, too. Making protein a larger proportion of your total caloric intake naturally means you’ll feel more full throughout the day, which can help curve cravings and keep you on track with your diet. There should be little concern over the diversification of your protein consumption and what kind of toll that has on your body. Some literature has shown that a high-protein diet of varying sources can be just as, if not more effective than any high-protein diet that comes from a singular source. ( 2 ) A whey protein is a welcome boon for your diet, but you have to evaluate every bit of information. Whey protein alone won’t make you gain strength or mass or lose weight and burn fat . It has to work in tandem with well-designed training and nutrition. There are some situations that may make it less desirable to pick up a tub of whey. If your diet itself is already in picture-perfect shape, you may have no need for a whey supplement in the first place. Although they deserve praise for nutritional density and protein purity, whey powders don’t generally provide any mystical quality that you can’t get from whole-food sources. If you have some form of lactose intolerance, most whey products are likely to produce some unwanted side effects such as stomach cramps, nausea, or constipation. Since your nutritional supplements are supposed to help you feel better, not worse, you may want to opt for another supplemental protein source. Some whey products do contain digestive enzymes to help mitigate their lactose-related effects, but it’s still worth noting. Many concentrates and their fancy flavors have a lot of processed, artificial ingredients such as synthetic sugars and dyes. If you’re the kind of athlete who strictly avoids processing as much as possible, or who has a dietary contraindication that requires you limit your sugar intake , many whey supplements should be off the table. Like most supplements, whey protein varies highly in cost. Although the gram-for-gram price of protein from a tub of whey is usually vastly cheaper than fresh poultry, you must purchase the entire tub at once. If you’re on the fence about whether you need a whey supplement, having to fork out a bunch of cash for a large stockpile you may not use is a valid concern. You can find a wide variety of whey proteins in the inventory of any garden variety supplement supplier. If you want the most bang for your buck, these specific choices stand tall above the rest. If you’re testing the waters when it comes to whey protein with what suits you best, Huge Supplements Whey Protein is a great initial purchase. Not only does this whey pack a generous 23 grams of protein per serving, (at around $1.50 per serving for those on a budget) it possesses few other extraneous nutrients, allowing you more flexibility with the rest of your diet. A blend of whey isolate and whey concentrate, Huge Supplements Whey Protein packs 23 grams of protein into each serving. It also contains 5g of BCAAs with only 2g of fat and 2.5g of carbs per serving. The macros are fairly lean with only 2g of fat and 2.5g of carbs per serving. Plus, the tasty flavors from Huge Supplements Whey Protein (like Strawberry Cheesecake) can help keep you consistent with your protein intake. In our opinion, you can’t go wrong with this affordable, high-protein blend when you’re just starting out. If you want to work more on weight loss, a whey isolate will offer the best helping hand as, again, it’s almost entirely protein. Disclaimer: Please note that none of these products describe themselves as weight loss supplements and should not be taken as such. Consult with a medical professional before beginning any weight loss protocol. Xwerks Grow is low in calories and has a lot of protein per serving — 110 calories and 25 grams of protein — and has no additional carbs, fats, or sugars. There are also no artificial flavors or sweeteners, and it has easy dissolution in water for consumption — a natural, pure whey for those trying to get a slimmer body. One of the very few protein powders with no carbs or fat whatsoever, this product contains 25 grams of whey protein isolate and is great for anyone looking for a leaner protein option. A unique benefit of this whey protein is near twice the amount of calcium other wheys provide. You’ll get 20 percent of your daily calcium from one serving, on average. Since calcium helps maintain your bone density, this is a fantastic whey to roll with. Say you primarily want to build muscle. If that’s the case, Transparent Labs Grass-Fed Whey Isolate is the perfect complement to that vision. One serving has a whopping 28 grams of protein and very little else in the way of carbs or fat. This transparent ingredient list includes a dose of calcium, iron, and potassium with 28 grams of protein, all from a company that goes out of its way to provide clear sourcing. This will be one of your more expensive whey protein options because of that high protein content and a grass-fed composition — which can help improve iron levels, among other benefits. But while it is pricier due to its quality formulation, you have a healthy selection of seven flavors to choose from. Related: When Is The Best Time to Drink a Protein Shake? In a nutshell, whey protein powders are efficient delivery devices for a moderate-to-high influx of high-quality protein with noteworthy pluses and minor drawbacks. What whey protein is best for you will come down to what you want out of your nutritional plan. Adding extra protein into your diet doesn’t have to be daunting. Regardless of whether you’re using it for recovery from conditioning or strength training , or just trying to move the needle with your weight, a whey protein has a viable place as an accessory to your fitness, provided you’ve done your research.

    "text": "Protein is among the most widely used supplements for muscle gain, and for good reason. While it’s much easier to hit your daily requirements for carbs and fat, many athletes struggle to consume enough protein to build muscle. And with so many types of protein on the market, including whey, casein, and plant-based proteins, finding the best protein powder for your needs and dietary preferences has never been simpler. To ensure you’re finding the best protein powder for muscle gain, our team of experts tested more than 100 different products. We’ve considered various fitness goals and preferences to gather a diverse list, so there’s truly something for every athlete. Below, former BarBend editor Nick English breaks down a few of his favorite protein powders for muscle gain. Transparent Labs has made one of the most straightforward protein supplements we've ever seen. It's just grass-fed whey isolate, natural flavor, salt, and stevia, making this one a great option for people who want a protein supplement with no additives. A good protein powder should prioritize high protein content to support your muscle growth goals, contain no fillers, and be easy to digest — Transparent Labs’ whey isolate protein powder checks all of these boxes. Pound for pound, it’s one of the best whey isolates we’ve tested. “Aiming for muscle growth doesn’t have to mean gaining fat, and oftentimes it probably shouldn’t. Sticking to a formulation like this one (which is almost all pure protein) that doesn’t promote mass gains may be a more healthful approach for many people,” explains Dr. Jennie Stanford, M.D., FAAFP, DipABOM. Transparent Labs Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate prioritizes muscle gain with its 28 grams of whey isolate protein per serving. “While the formulation varies slightly between flavors, the core formula remains the same,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, a registered dietitian nutritionist. “Based on the amount of whey protein, Himalayan rock salt, stevia, and natural flavors, Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate scores a 4.5 out of 5 for its formulation.” Our team tried the seasonal Peppermint Hot Chocolate and absolutely loved the flavor. “The taste was exactly as described,” our tester, a certified personal trainer, says, giving the flavor a 5 out of 5. “All I needed was some marshmallows and it was just like real hot chocolate.” While this flavor isn’t available right now (but keep your eyes peeled), we also love the Milk Chocolate. We also give the overall solubility a 5 out of 5, considering we’ve had zero issues with floaties or clumps — no one likes floaties when you’re trying to sip a protein shake. We mixed ours in a shaker bottle and it separated perfectly fine. Then, we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Transparent Labs lands in the top 25% overall, earning a B. See our results below. BarBend worked with an accredited lab to gather testing data on heavy metal content in Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate. When it comes to price, Transparent Labs isn’t the cheapest, but it’s not crazy pricey, either. The $1.99 per serving ($59.99 for a container of 30 servings) is pretty standard. However, for those who are shopping on a budget, you can find options that are less than $1.50 per serving. So, we give the product an overall 3.5 out of 5 for value. Read our full Transparent Labs Whey Protein Powder Review . This formula is 100 percent New Zealand Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate with 25 grams of protein per serving. It includes no hormones, antibiotics or pesticides and comes in four delicious flavors --- Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, and Peanut Butter. Protein powders aren’t really a gender-specific supplement. That being said, Xwerks Grow can make a good fit for male athletes (or athletes of any gender) looking to grow muscle. Grow’s formula consists only of New Zealand grass-fed whey protein , which has some of the strictest and highest standards for dairy quality. So, you won’t get any hormones, antibiotics, or pesticides in your whey protein. Plus, this one is third-party tested, so you can trust you’re getting what the label says. ( 1 ) “XWERKS Grow scores a 4.5 out of 5 for its formulation, with high marks for its protein content and natural sweeteners,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, our expert reviewer. One serving is only 110 calories (one of the lowest on this list), consisting of 25 grams of protein, only 1 to 2 grams of carbs, and 0 to 2 grams of fat (depending on the flavor). So, if building strength is the priority, you’ll like this protein-focused formula. Xwerks uses natural flavorings and Stevia as a sweetener, so the taste is hard to match. ( 2 ) “The Chocolate actually tastes like chocolate milk,” explains our tester, who is also a certified personal trainer, giving the flavor a 5 out of 5. “This is probably the best protein powder I’ve ever sipped. It doesn’t taste artificial.” Plus, we have to give the product a 5 out of 5 for solubility, too. “I had no problems mixing this product,” our tester says. “This protein is so fine and smooth, you barely even need a blender ball.” Don’t expect to see any chunks or clumps with this protein. Xwerks may sound too good to be true. Well, that’s not exactly the case, but unfortunately, high quality comes at a price. We had to give this whey a 3.5 out of 5 for price per serving, considering it’s nearly $2 per scoop. For some, the $59 price tag may be too much to pay each month. But if you can afford it, you won’t be disappointed. Read our full Xwerks Grow Whey Protein Review . Dig into this easily digesting grass-fed whey isolate that provides 25 grams of protein with each lean 110 calorie scoop. It comes in three tasty flavors at a cost-effective price making it a solid choice for nearly anyone. While it can be difficult to consistently hit your allotted daily protein goal, it doesn’t have to be flavorless. When it comes to the best-tasting protein powder , Jacked Factory Authentic ISO has you covered. After all, the more delicious it is, the more likely you are to remember your shake and (therefore), start making some much-desired muscle gain. “I’ve had the Fruity Cereal Splash flavor, and it actually tastes like Fruit Loops,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer, giving the taste an overall 4 out of 5. “It had a little bit of a medicinal aftertaste, though. Not enough to dissuade me from buying, but may be good to know for some buyers.” “Jacked Factory Authentic ISO earns a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation with deductions for its sodium content and lack of third-party testing,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says. In one scoop, you get 25 grams of protein per serving (the exact macros may vary by a gram or two, depending on the flavor), with only 1 gram of carbs and 0.5 gram of fat. We also liked that it mixed smoothly, earning a 5 out of 5 for solubility. Our testers have no issues mixing the powder and haven’t noticed any clumps at the bottom of their shaker cup. Jacked Factory offers eleven flavors, including the standards like Vanilla, Chocolate, and Unflavored. But you also get some unique options, like Blueberry Muffin, Cinnamon French Toast, and Fruity Cereal Splash. Given the variety, there’s definitely something for everyone. We were also big fans of the price point, giving it an overall 4 out of 5 for price per serving. One 30-serving container costs $39.99, which is about $1.33 per serving. This is among the cheaper products, but for those on a tight budget, there are less expensive options. Also, we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Jacked Factory lands in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. BarBend worked with a third-party accredited lab to test Jacked Factory Authentic Protein. We looked at the product’s metal content, bisphenol content, and more. While our testers haven’t noticed any negative side effects after drinking a scoop, Jacked Factory does sweeten this powder with sucralose. Artificial sweeteners can cause digestive unrest for some, so it may not be the best pick for every athlete. ( 3 ) Read our full Jacked Factory Authentic ISO Review . With nothing artificial, whey from New Zealand, a good amount of fiber, and little sugar, this mass gainer will satisfy most athletes. It's a clean mass gainer that focuses on simplicity over added bells and whistles. In order to build significant muscle mass, you need to eat in a caloric surplus. But it can be tough to up your calories if you’re already eating plenty of solid foods. Transparent Labs’ Mass Gainer, one of the best mass gainer supplements we’ve tested, can help make this process a little easier. With 730 to 750 calories per serving (13 to 14 grams of fat, 106 to 110 grams of carbs, and 51 to 53 grams of protein), this mass gainer can help add some serious calories to your daily diet, earning an overall 4.5 out of 5 from our product testers. The macronutrients are balanced, giving your body what it needs to repair and build muscle mass. “Transparent Labs Mass Gainer scores a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “It accomplishes exactly what it’s intended to accomplish and the ingredients list is very transparent. However, the sodium and saturated fat content is quite high.” Although you only get two flavor options (Sweet Vanilla and Chocolate Glaze Donut), we think the taste is pretty accurate. Our product tester and certified personal trainer tried the Chocolate Glaze Donut flavor and reports: “I thought it really tasted like a chocolate donut — the flavor was accurate.” But considering there was so little variety, we have to give the flavor an overall 4 out of 5. But for solubility, this mass gainer earns a 5 out of 5. “It dissolved smoothly with no clumping at the bottom of my shaker bottle,” our tester says. “The consistency was also smooth with no chalky or gritty taste.” While the price per serving is a lot higher than the other supplements on the list, it’s actually pretty on par with other mass gainers on the market. One 15-serving container costs $79.99, making it about $5.33 per serving. This costs a pretty penny, but considering how many calories you get per serving, think of it like paying for a small meal — however, considering it doesn’t have added vitamins and minerals, it shouldn’t actually serve as a meal replacement. Transparent Labs created a mass gainer with strength gain at the forefront. With high macros across the board, this formula is here to support you in your quest for muscle growth. Read our full Transparent Labs Mass Gainer Review . Gainful Protein Powder is fully customizable, allowing you to get a product that meets your specific health needs, including losing weight, gaining weight, or building muscle. Studies have shown that a high-protein diet is preferable to one low in protein for women hoping to build fat-free mass in a resistance-training program. ( 4 ) Supplementing with a protein powder, then, can be an effective way for women (and likely, people across the gender spectrum) to maximize their training and build strength. We like Gainful for these goals, as the company allows you to customize your supplement with muscle growth in mind. “The minimal ingredients make this an intriguing formula, but I think it misses the mark just a bit for those trying to create a personalized formula based on health or fitness goals,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gives the formula a 4 out of 5. “Those looking to gain weight, especially, may be left wanting for more than this protein powder offers.” On Gainful’s site, choose between three different “goal boosts” — Lose Weight, Gain Weight, Build Muscle — and four different types of protein that cater to different diets and tastes. See them below. Based on your choice, your customized powder will contain between 19 and 26 grams of protein and 110 to 140 calories. They’re available unflavored, but you can also add on individual flavor boosts, such as Strawberry Cream and Madagascar Vanilla. “Gainful definitely doesn’t make budget supplements, but the customization makes it a solid option for those with dietary restrictions,” says our tester, a personal trainer, while noting that the cost of this supp is more than double that of many budget protein powders. Still, they score a 4 out of 5, noting the unique customization options, high-quality ingredients, and delicious flavors. “I really enjoyed how the packs let you control how much or little flavor you want to add in each shake,” says our tester, a personal trainer. “I tried most of them and even mixed a few, which was fun. I even dug the Sea Salt Caramel flavor, which is not usually a favorite.” Taste scores a 5 out of 5, though you should note that the flavor packs will add around 6 to 10 extra calories. They also include organic tapioca maltodextrin, organic monk fruit, and organic stevia, which may lead to gastrointestinal distress for some users. ( 8 ) While we enjoy this Gainful profile, we do wish it was clear whether or not Gainful puts their products through third-party testing, thus resulting in a 2 out of 5 for the category. We also got a whole lot of clumps when mixing it with milk in a shaker. “Didn’t love that, but the flavor was spot on,” our tester says, recommending you mix this one with a blender. [Related: Best Protein Powders for Women ] A grass-fed whey isolate includes added ingredients for digestion like seven digestive enzymes and a probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus). It's also gluten-free, sugar-free, and soy-free. While most adults can pretty easily digest protein powder, that’s not the case for everyone. Luckily, Onnit’s Grass-Fed Whey Isolate Protein includes digestive enzymes and probiotics to help ease stomach discomfort. ( 9 ) “Onnit Whey Protein scores a 4.5 out of 5 for its formula, in my opinion,” according to BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “The macro ratio is on point for its goals, and the enzyme blend is intriguing.” Our testers have tried the Mexican Chocolate and are actually pretty impressed by the flavor. “I thought the flavor tasted pretty good,” one tester says, giving the taste a 3.75 out of 5. “I can actually tell the difference between this flavor and standard chocolate.” However, we aren’t huge fans of the texture. It was actually a little too thin for our preference. That being said, we give the solubility a 5 out of 5. This powder dissolves really well and our product tester noticed zero clumps or floaties in their shaker cup. We haven’t noticed any negative side effects while sipping this supplement, which is a huge plus (probably thanks to the digestive enzymes). However, we aren’t able to find any information on third-party testing for this product. We had to give Onnit a 1 out of 5 in that category and wish the brand had some lab certifications. While we like the ingredients in this formula, it isn’t the most cost-friendly protein powder. One 30-serving container costs $59.95, which is about $1.99 per serving. We had to give this product a 2 out of 5 for cost per serving, as you can definitely find some more cost-friendly options. Read our full Onnit Grass-Fed Whey Isolate Review . Need a protein powder that’s light on cost yet heavy on flavor? Available in four traditional tastes — Chocolate Peanut Butter, Chocolate, Strawberry Milkshake, and Vanilla — this Nutricost offering is available for less than $1 per serving, which can be ideal for athletes looking to build a well-rounded supplement regimen on a budget. You don’t have to spend $70 a month on protein to get an effective, high-quality protein powder for building muscle. If you’re bulking on a budget , we think Nutricost Whey Protein Isolate is a great protein powder with plenty of flavor options for only $1.52 per serving when you subscribe to recurring deliveries. Nutricost has several size options, including a 2-pound and 5-pound container. The larger the size you buy, the more money you save. We decided to take a closer look at the 5-pound option. This container costs $117.95 for 62 servings and when you subscribe, you only pay $94.36 for the container. Considering the manageable price point and delivery convenience, we give the cost a 4 out of 5. This has only 140 calories per serving, including 0.5 gram of fat, 1 gram of carbs, and 30 grams of protein. “I’d score this formula a 3.5 out of 5,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, our expert reviewer. “It has room for improvement with the sweeteners used and third-party testing.” Nutricost has since labeled their packaging as third-party testing but doesn’t offer many specifics. You do get plenty of flavors, though, which is a bonus. Nutricost offers their protein in 10 different options, including some more unique flavors like Strawberry Acai and Cake Batter. After trying the Chocolate Peanut Butter, our tester gives the flavor a 5 out of 5. “I’m not the biggest peanut butter fan but this one was great,” they say. “It wasn’t too powerful, and the peanut butter isn’t stronger than the chocolate.” Even in just a shaker cup, this formula dissolves pretty well, according to our testers. We haven’t noticed any big clumps or settling, so our team rates the solubility a 5 out of 5. Plus, the texture is pretty pleasing, especially when mixed with milk. Read our full Nutricost Whey Protein Concetrate Review . An all natural, non-GMO, fat-free whey that's cheaper than many competitors, Legion Whey Isolate Protein Powder is made from 100 percent grass-fed whey protein isolate from sustainable dairy farms in Ireland. It's also higher in calcium compared to other powders on the market. For athletes who want to prioritize all-natural ingredients in their muscle-building supplements, Legion is the ideal brand. This product, one of the best organic protein powders we’ve tested, uses only natural ingredients with no artificial sweeteners, flavors, food dyes, or fillers. ( 10 ) Plus, the whey is made with milk from grass-fed and pasture-raised cows. This supplement is relatively lean, with only 100 to 130 calories per serving, including up to 23 grams of protein, 0 to 3 grams of fat, and 2 to 4 grams of carbs (flavor depending). However, many of the other products on this list contain a little more protein (usually 25 to 28 grams), which may be a turnoff for some athletes. “Legion Whey+ scores a 4.75 out of 5 for its formula,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, our expert reviewer. “It’s not the most protein-dense protein powder, but its macro ratios and ingredient sources are impressive.” Legion delivers on flavor, too, earning a 4.5 out of 5 from our product tester, who also has his personal training certification. “The Cinnamon Cereal tastes just like a bowl of Cinnamon Toast Crunch,” our tester says. “However, I wish it were a little more pungent. The flavor is definitely accurate, but I wish it were a tiny bit richer, like the cereal.” This whey also earns a 5 out of 5 for solubility, as our tester didn’t notice any clumps. Unlike many other whey supplements, Legion’s whey is third-party tested. It’s certified to contain no banned substances by Labdoor, so what you read on the label is what you’re getting. We also worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Legion landed in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. BarBend worked with an accredited lab to gather testing data on the overall purity of Legion Whey+ protein powder. All these benefits come at a cost. We had to give this protein a 3.5 out of 5 for the price per serving. At $1.99 per scoop, this is among the more expensive protein powders on the market. For many shoppers, paying $59.99 for a 30-serving container every month may be unrealistic. Read our full Legion Whey Review . This whey isolate from Momentous offers 20 grams of protein with only 100 calories per serving. In addition to the protein, there's also 90mg of calcium and 115mg of potassium, as well as an enzyme blend to help aid digestion. Whey is one of the best protein supplements for muscle gain to keep in your cabinet. Momentous Whey Protein Isolate is sourced from grass-fed cows and undergoes a micro-processing filtration, which may help sustain the protein’s amino acid profile. In short, Momentous makes a high-quality whey. When it comes to formulation, our RDN gave this formula a 4.25 out of 5 with deductions for its cost per serving and the presence of proprietary blends. Offering only 100 calories per serving, including 3 grams of carbs and 23 grams of protein, this is a pretty lean and simple formula. But Momentous does include ProHydrolase, a digestive enzyme blend to prevent bloating and digestion difficulty. ( 11 ) After giving this protein a try, our tester, who is also a certified personal trainer, thinks the formula was incredibly smooth and easy to sip, giving the taste a 4 out of 5. “The chocolate tastes a lot like hot chocolate without needing to mix it with milk,” our tester says. “I’d definitely buy this flavor again.” However, we do wish Momentous offered more flavors, as they only have Vanilla, Chocolate, and Unflavored. We also gave this supplement a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “I actually mixed a double dose (two scoops) with water, and I didn’t notice any floaties or clumps,” our tester says. “The formula is very smooth, and there’s no grittiness.” Also, we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Momentous landed in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. BarBend worked with an independent accredited lab to examine the purity and label accuracy of Momentous Whey Isolate protein. There’s one pretty inevitable downside to this product: “It’s incredibly expensive,” our tester says. “The flavor is fantastic, and it’s a high-quality product with third-party testing, but the price tag is probably too much for most buyers.” Given the high cost ($2.70 per serving or $64.95 for 24 servings), we have to give Momentous Whey a 1 out of 5 for price per serving. But if you can afford it, we think it’s a great, high-end option. Well-rounded, well-priced casein that contains enzymes that might improve its digestion. Each single-scoop serving packs 24 grams of protein and just a single gram of sugar. Both whey and casein protein come from milk, but they’re absorbed differently. Your body absorbs and digests casein powders more slowly, meaning you get a slower release of amino acids compared to whey. That’s why casein is ideal to drink before bed — it helps promote muscle gain during recovery. This supplement from Optimum Nutrition is one of the best casein protein powders we’ve tested. “Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Casein scores 4.25 out of 5,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, our expert reviewer. “[It gets] high marks for its lean macro ratio and high zinc content.” This product only has 120 calories per serving with 4 grams of carbs, 1 gram of fat, and 24 grams of protein. This also contains 40% of your daily calcium value, which is more than most whey protein powders — also ideal if you don’t get enough calcium in your daily diet. ( 12 ) Our tester also gives the flavor a 5 out of 5 after trying both the Chocolate Peanut Butter and Chocolate Supreme. “I loved both of these flavors. They’re both smooth and rich,” they say. “I’d honestly say the Chocolate Supreme is practically as good as chocolate pudding.” Unlike whey, which dissolves in liquid, casein gets pretty thick, according to our tester, who gives it a 4.5 out of 5 for solubility. “I like to mix my casein into food or make protein pudding,” our tester says. “It mixes well, but it doesn’t dissolve.” So, if you prefer to drink your protein in a shaker, you may want to opt for whey. We do like that this product is third-party tested and Informed Sport-certified. But, we had to give it a 2 out of 5 for price per serving. At about $2.15 per serving ($53.99 for a 25-serving container), it’s one of the pricier proteins on this list. Although casein is great for those who want a high-protein snack before bed, there are cheaper whey supplements that can help promote muscle gain, too. Read our full Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Casein Review. Dymatize ISO 100's hydrolyzed whey absorbs faster than other forms of whey as enzymes partly break it down. Plus, this product is sweet and tastes great mixed with water. Dymatize ISO 100 is a hydrolyzed protein powder , meaning that it is broken down from an isolate into a form that is even more rapidly digestible by the body. This form of protein is 95% protein by weight, which leaves a low carb, fat, and lactose content, making it a potentially better protein option for those looking to build muscle without adding many fats and carbs to their diet. ( 13 ) “Dymatize ISO 100 scores 4 out of 5 for its formulation,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer, says. “It provides 25 grams of protein and not much else, which is good for those who want to boost their protein intake.” We do want to note, however, that the specific macros vary slightly between flavors, so be sure to double-check the ingredient label if you’re keeping close track of your daily intake. While Dymatize does offer a variety of unique flavors, our tester gives the Cocoa Pebbles a 3.5 out of 5. “There’s nothing too special about the flavor. It’s definitely not the worst I’ve ever tasted, but there are better-tasting options,” our tester says. “The Cocoa Pebbles flavor isn’t much tastier than other chocolate-flavored protein powders. I’d recommend mixing it with milk.” After mixing in a shaker bottle, our tester didn’t notice any clumps, giving it a 4 out of 5 for solubility. “It mixes pretty thin, though, which I don’t love for chocolate protein,” they say. “I love drinking chocolate milk, but this is more like chocolate water.” We also worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Dymatize lands in the top 10% overall, earning an A. See our results below. This Gourmet Vanilla variety of Dymatize ISO 100 Hydrolyzed Whey earned an overall A grade for purity and label transparency from our independent accredited lab. The price isn’t as high as some products on the market, but there are definitely cheaper options. We gave the price per serving a 3.25 out of 5, considering the $1.67 per serve price tag. One container is about $33.43 for 20 servings, which is less product than most other brands offer. However, you can subscribe to monthly deliveries for $31.76. Our tester did give this product a 5 out of 5 for side effects, though. Hydrolyzed whey has very little lactose, which means you probably won’t experience any bloating or digestive trouble. ( 13 ) Read our full Dymatize ISO 100 Review . We gave more than 100 protein powders a try in our testing lab to get a well-rounded idea of all the products on the market. Using the BarBend supplement testing methodology , we scored each product on a scale of 1 (boo) to 5 (yay) in areas such as taste, solubility, and formulation. Below are some of the key factors we considered when making our picks. If you hit the gym consistently, you’ve likely seen someone drinking a protein supplement from a shaker bottle. “You may find that the biggest benefit of using protein powder is the ability to meet your protein needs quickly and easily,” Samina Qureshi, a registered dietitian nutritionist, tells BarBend . “You can add protein powder to your smoothies, make a quick shake, add it to your baked goods, and more!” Read on to learn some of the many benefits of protein powder. [Related: Best Creatine Supplements ] Protein powders have a fairly narrow range of prices, especially when discussing high-quality protein powders — like we have on this list. Generally, protein powders feel expensive up front but end up being a reasonably cost-effective way of adding more protein to your diet when you’re trying to gain muscle. When you target muscle gains, there can be many factors to consider. Being realistic with your goals and considering dosage, type of protein, additional ingredients, and price are all things to think about when you’re purchasing any supplement. It’s important to be realistic when it comes to supplements for muscle gain or bodybuilding. Even the best protein shakes won’t yield muscular results without resistance training. That said, proper nutrition and supplementation are also extremely important factors. If you’re working out and not getting the proper amount of macronutrients, it can mean a loss of muscle mass. For example, carbs are the main source of energy in the body. If you don’t have proper glycogen stores, your body will use muscle in order to attain the energy it needs to utilize, and it will take a toll on muscle gains overall. ( 16 ) Depending on what your goals are, you want to consider dosages of protein in your powder, as well as other macros. You may want a protein powder that delivers a high protein content while keeping carbs and fats low if you’re cutting, just looking for a solid protein snack, or you prefer eating your carbs and fats rather than drinking them. If you’re bulking, you may want a higher macronutrient profile all around. This list contains a wide variety of proteins, like whey concentrate, whey isolate, hydrolyzed whey, pumpkin seed protein, and pea protein. Depending on your lifestyle choices, dietary preferences, and needs, there may be one that is better suited for your goals than the others. Scooping supplement into water. Some people find that plant-based proteins are better on their stomach if they have issues digesting lactose, or if they choose a plant-based lifestyle. Hydrolyzed whey is another good option for those who have stomach issues, as the process to hydrolyze whey cuts the proteins into a more easily digestible form. Each type of protein will have pros and cons to them, so take some time to figure out what makes the most sense for you. Your diet needs may be different during different phases of fitness or your life, and it’s important to factor in the additional ingredients listed in each formula. For example, if you’re looking to avoid artificial sweeteners, flavors, or ingredients there will be some powders on this list that won’t fit your needs. If you want a protein that also contains BCAAs for recovery, you will want to opt for a formula that includes a solid dosage of them in their ingredient list. 24 ) All the formulas in these proteins vary, so we suggest reading each label and ingredient list thoroughly before making a purchase. Price can be an important factor when it comes to buying supplements. The formulas will vary by ingredients, quality, serving size, and formulation. This means that the price of each product will vary equally. If you’re opting for straight protein, and you don’t care much about the extra bells and whistles, you’ll potentially pay less per serving than you would for a formula that contains some extras, like BCAAs, or even one that has an all-natural formula. “There are a variety of different protein powders, including whey, casein, hemp, brown rice, and pea protein; the list goes on,” Samina Qureshi, a registered dietitian nutritionist, tells BarBend . Below, we dig into each type a little deeper. No. Protein powder isn’t necessary for muscle gain, but adequate daily protein intake is a necessity. Many people struggle to hit the necessary protein requirements that will help optimize muscle gains, and that’s where protein powder can come in handy. There are tons of different options out there to accommodate every diet, goal, price range, and more. For someone with no dietary restrictions, we think Transparent Labs Grass-Fed Whey Protein is the best overall. It’s packed with 28 grams of pure whey isolate to potentially get to your muscles faster. Protein powders typically have a fairly narrow price range of around $45 to $65 per container with notable exceptions, like bulk size containers and mass gainers. The average per-serving price is generally around $1.50 to $2.25. Again, the exceptions are mass gainers, which tend to run around $5 per serving, and bulk proteins on the opposite end of the spectrum, which can be as cheap as $1.25 per serving with a larger up front cost. There is no generic main factor to consider other than what makes the most sense for your goals. Whether it’s protein content, carbs and fats, micronutrients, price, or the type of protein that fits your lifestyle — it’s important to remember what makes the most sense for you. There will be a lot of variables, so stick with what will work best with your current goals and lifestyle. All the supplements that we have on our lists have been researched by our staff for integrity and quality. It is always most important to speak with your healthcare provider when you are adding new supplements to your regimen though — especially if you have any allergies or sensitivities to ingredients or supplements.

    "text": "Alongside the best protein powders and multivitamins, creatine is one of the best supplements for muscle growth — and for good reason. Naturally occurring in foods like meat and dairy, this popular supplement is known as a “muscle energizer” and is mostly stored in our muscles and brain. ( 1 ) Creatine has been widely studied over the years, with research supporting its status as a powerful tool for muscle strength, power, post-workout recovery, and certain aspects of brain function. ( 2 )( 4 ) “ Creatine is a supplement that has solid research to support muscle growth , among other positive health benefits ,” says Dr. Kimberly Langdon, M.D. The best creatine supplements are available in many forms, including creatine monohydrate, creatine ethyl ester, and micronized creatine, to name a few. But given that so many profiles exist (and at varying price points), where do you start? To lend a hand, our team tested more than 40 top-performing picks across the category, using our supplement testing methodology to analyze each supplement in categories such as: Over the years, our expert team of reviewers has helped over 1.6 million BarBend readers find the best supplement for their fitness goals. For this article, we worked with Jillian Kubala, RDN, and researched customer reviews and other verified sources to determine the best creatine supplements on the market today. Ready to give your body a well-deserved boost? Let’s get into our findings. Medical Disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended to diagnose, prevent, and/or treat health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Join BarBend expert tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC, and our expert reviewer, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, as they answer some common questions about creatine and also share their picks for the top creatine capsules, powders, pills, and gummies. We like that this product includes hydroxymethyl butyrate, the main metabolite in leucine that prevents muscle protein breakdown. Plus, the Blue Raspberry flavor is tasty, and the blend contains no artificial sweeteners. Transparent labs is by far one of our best creatine brands. As far as formulation goes, this product earned a high score, according to our expert. “ Transparent Labs Creatine gets a 4.5 out of 5 for its formula,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says. “The ingredients are clinically dosed and baked by science.” Transparent Labs Creatine HMB packs 5,000 milligrams of creatine monohydrate per serving, which is ideal, as research suggests taking doses of three to five grams per day for at least 28 days may help increase creatine levels in your muscles. ( 11 ) For that reason, we think this product is an excellent option for those who want a creatine for bulking. This product includes 1.5 grams of HMB (hydroxymethyl butyrate), which has been associated with positive post-workout muscle recovery , allowing your tired, damaged muscles to bounce back quicker for better performance. ( 24 ) “The addition of vitamin D is helpful, as a large percentage of the population has low or deficient vitamin D levels,” says Jillian Kubala, RD. “This can impact energy, muscle function, recovery, and more.” In this product, you get 60 percent of your daily value. As our best creatine powder, this supplement is available in 13 different flavors with no artificial sweeteners, so we’d particularly recommend this product for those who prefer flavored supplements. “I tried Black Cherry and didn’t love it as much as I have loved some other creatine powders. It tasted a little watered down, even with the recommended amount of water,” notes our tester, a certified nutrition coach. That being said, she gave it a 4 out of 5 for taste, as some people may prefer the lighter flavor. We do wish this creatine dissolved a little better. “When I shook up this creatine, I noticed the floaties didn’t dissolve completely,” according to our tester who gave the solubility a 3.5 out of 5. So, if you don’t have an electric stirrer or blender, you may want a more soluble product. Although we love this product, we don’t love the price tag. One 30-serving bottle costs $49.99, which is about $1.66 per serving. Since this is pricier than most other products, we had to give this category a 1 out of 5. For a more affordable creatine pick, try the Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate. Read our full Transparent Labs Creatine HMB Review . These gummies boast 4 grams of creatine monohydrate and come in a delicious strawberry flavor. You do need to chew 5 for a full dose, but they’re so tasty, we don’t think you’ll have any complaints about that. The best creatine gummies can be a delicious way to take your supplements. Swoly Creatine Mono Gummies fall right in line here — “I thought these creatine gummies were freakin’ delicious,” notes Kate Meier, NASM-CPT, USAW-L1, CF-L1, giving the flavor a 5 out of 5. It’s easy to take gummies (like these from Swoly) with you on the road, too, making them one of the simplest options on this list for those who travel frequently and want to maintain a supplement routine. “Swoly Creatine Gummies get a 4 out of 5 for their formulation,” adds Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “I’m a fan of the amount of creatine monohydrate provided in each serving . Deductions came from the use of artificial flavors and small amounts of added sugar.” Aside from the 2.5 grams of added sugar, there are 4 grams of creatine monohydrate in each serving of Swoly gummies. This is right in range for your daily recommended 3 to 5 grams, but most of the best creatine brands dose their creatine monohydrate products closer to five grams, making this one a bit on the low side. ( 27 ) We gave these gummies a 5 out of 5 for swallowability, as well. “They’re so easy to eat and delicious,” Meier said. “I genuinely look forward to eating these.” However, some may be more appreciative of a smaller serving size — Swoly recommends consuming five gummies per dose. Meier’s enthusiasm can’t hide the fact that this is an expensive supplement, though. Swoly’s 30-serving bottle costs $34.99, putting these gummies at $1.17 per serving — almost $0.75 per serving higher than other creatines, earning a 1 out of 5 for cost. We wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who’s on a strict budget. Instead, consider the Crazy Muscle Creatine Pills, which are lower in cost but just as easy to travel with. One thing to note: Creatine gummies are relatively new, according to Bourgeois. “Most research has looked at the effects of creatine powders,” she says. “There hasn’t been much research, if any, on creatine gummies and digestion’s impact on their effects.” So, if you’re doubtful, opt for a powder. Read our full Swoly Creatine Gummies Review . This unflavored micronized creatine is available in two different size options and is Informed Sport certified, vegan, and gluten-free. You can even subscribe to recurring deliveries and save 15 percent. For athletes competing in a league or federation, it’s crucial to find products that are certified for sport. That’s why we love Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate for athletes specifically — this product is Informed Sport Certified, and packs 5,000 milligrams of creatine per serving. “As far as its formulation goes, Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate hits the nail on the head,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gave the formula a 5-out-of-5 rating. “It provides the upper end of what research considers an effective dose of creatine and doesn’t contain any unnecessary fillers .” On the other hand, if you’re looking for your creatine to pack a major punch, you might be disappointed in the lack of supplemental ingredients. Unfortunately, this product doesn’t offer any flavor options, so if that’s a must in your potions and powders, the Sports Research Creatine is not for you. However, our testers enjoyed how unflavored it actually is, giving the taste a 5 out of 5 and dubbing it one of the best tasting creatines we trialed. “I like mixing my creatine with BCAAs or other supplements and this one truly adds no flavor at all,” they said. If you prefer your BCAAs and creatine in one simple supplement, check out Six Star Pro Nutrition Creatine X3 . “Even when mixed with water, it just tastes like water,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer. After mixing one scoop in a cup with a spoon, we noticed a little sediment at the bottom, which earned the solubility a 4.5 out of 5. However, when we mixed the product with electrolytes supplements , we didn’t notice any settling. So, our team definitely recommends combining the product with another supplement. The price point for this creatine is approachable, too, at only $17.95 for 10.58 ounces. This is a definite plus considering the included third-party certifications that typically elevate costs. For those on a tighter budget, though, we have been able to locate some Sports Research Discount Codes for potential discounts. This is a tasty option for folks who are looking for creatine hydrochloride in either pill or powder form. It’s third-party tested for banned substances and competitively priced. While creatine monohydrate is one of the most widely-studied supplements today, there are other types of creatine that can prove beneficial to certain athletes. One such form is creatine hydrochloride (creatine HCl) that studies link to higher absorption rates and lowered chances of GI distress and bloating. ( 37 ) Kaged Creatine HCl offers these perks in a tasty, soluble powder, earning its place within our rankings. Creatine HCl’s formulation is fairly clean with creatine hydrochloride serving as the lone active ingredient. “I rate the makeup at 4 out of 5, though, since the 750 milligrams is somewhat underserved when compared to other supplements offering up to 5 grams,” notes Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD. Additionally, we note that the flavored powder options do contain sucralose, which may lead to stomach discomfort in some athletes. As far as taste is concerned, our tester, a certified personal trainer, scores Kaged Creatine HCl at a perfect 5 out of 5. “I trialed the Lemon Lime offering and found the powder to be a perfect blend of sweet and tart.” Solubility also scores well at 5 out of 5, with our tester noting no residue or separation when mixing up their daily servings. You can purchase Kaged Creatine HCl for roughly $0.33 per serving, meaning it sits amongst the more wallet-friendly creatine supplements we’ve had in testing. While we rate the value at 5 out of 5, our tester does offer a caveat. “Each serving is just 750 milligrams of creatine hydrochloride , so you’d need to take up to four or five servings daily to achieve research-backed daily values,” they note. “By that math, you’d need to purchase a new container every few weeks — a less-than-efficient buying strategy.” If you’d prefer to get your creatine dosages in one fell swoop without the need for multiple monthly orders, we recommend powders such as Bulk Supplements Creatine or Jacked Factory Creatine Monohydrate. Lastly, we feel Kaged Creatine HCl can be ideal for competitive athletes thanks to the Informed Sport certification. This third-party testing helps ensure athletes that the supplement facts are accurate and there are no banned substances within the makeup. If you want a highly-absorbable, athlete-friendly creatine solution, Kaged can deliver. Read our full Kaged Creatine HCl Review . MRM Nutrition Creatine delivers a straightforward and budget-conscious option for lifters seeking a clean, effective creatine supplement. Its unflavored formula is versatile, though those wanting added ingredients or flavors might want to look elsewhere. Looking to bolster your strength training progress with a performance-boosting supplement? Creatine has been linked to better muscle growth, increased power, and better strength metrics in both short-term and long-term uses. ( 1 )( 2 ) If your goal is to build muscle, we recommend choosing MRM Nutrition Creatine thanks to its research-backed dosage and non-GMO, gluten-free makeup. Each serving of this MRM Nutrition offering contains 5 grams of creatine monohydrate — one of the most studied creatine forms. Plus, there are no artificial ingredients or added compounds, meaning you’re solely consuming the beneficial amino acid without interference from other nutrients. As such, we score the formulation at 5 out of 5. Be mindful, though, that MRM Nutrition is not third-party tested, making it less ideal for competitive athletes needing to abide by strict governing regulations. For these needs, we recommend looking at products such as Transparent Labs Creatine HMB or Kaged Creatine HCl. This creatine powder is unflavored, but our tester, a certified personal trainer, states that the powder does have a bit of a presence when taken on its own. “I still score the taste at 4.5 out of 5, though, since the flavor note isn’t off-putting and can be easily masked when added to other beverages or supplements,” they add. In terms of solubility, our tester states, “There was no residue left at the bottom of my cup, and the powder seems to dissolve evenly with no signs of separation.” This is a definite plus for those stacking supplements, as the creatine can mix well without leaving behind any particles that would otherwise lower your consumed dosage. Solubility, as such, earns a 5-out-of-5 score, as well. While flavored options could be beneficial for those seeking an all-in-one tasty training treat, we feel this MRM Nutrition powder can be worthwhile for those wanting to craft different training beverage recipes aligned to their taste buds. Plus, at roughly $0.31 per serving and 100 servings per container, you have some room to experiment with different concoctions and combinations. This extremely inexpensive creatine is micronized for extra solubility. We also appreciate Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate for its available flavor profiles, although the use of sucralose as a sweetening agent may lead to GI distress in some athletes. Unlike some of the best greens powders , for instance, you don’t need to spend a ton of money on the best creatine brands and products to get a quality supplement. With costs starting at $0.21 per serving, Nutricost’s Creatine Monohydrate is the perfect example of a high-quality creatine at a budget-friendly price. For cost per serving, this pick definitely earned a 5 out of 5, and we’d recommend it for anyone who wants an affordable creatine supplement. The formula for this one is pretty simple, too. “Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate scores a 4 out of 5 for its formulation, as the flavored options contain sucralose and other additives,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “However, I’d score the unflavored option with a perfect 5.” “This unflavored creatine is actually completely tasteless,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer, giving the flavor a 4.5 out of 5. “I’ve paired this supplement with my pre-workout and other powders, yet it never affects the taste.” Unfortunately, though, this product isn’t as soluble as we would have liked. “This creatine settled a lot,” notes our tester in reference to their 3-out-of-5 solubility rating. “This is pretty common for creatine but it does gather at the bottom of my cup.” BarBend editorial member and certified personal trainer Rosie Borchert has been using this creatine for about 6 months, stating, “I never experienced any bloating from this product, even when I was in the loading phase .” As such, Nutricost earns a perfect 5 out of 5 for side effects. Be mindful, though, that the included sucralose (in the flavored options) can lead to GI distress and stomach issues in some athletes, so be sure to proceed with some sense of caution. The brand does claim the product is third-party tested, though information is limited online when it comes to identifying the actual accrediting lab. Since it’s not sport certified, we wouldn’t recommend Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate for competing athletes. Instead, we’d suggest Sports Research Creatine. Read our full Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate Review . Legion Recharge is a well-rounded option that includes a solid dose of creatine monohydrate, along with l-carnitine l-tartrate, which may help to reduce exercise-induced muscle damage and improve recovery. You don’t necessarily need to take creatine before training. Actually, it can work as one of the best post-workout supplements , too, especially when it comes to a top creatine like Legion Recharge. We like this pick for its impressive 5,000mg of micronized creatine. We also appreciate Recharge’s heightened focus on post-workout recovery, thanks to the corosolic acid, which may support healthy inflammation levels, though more research on the benefit is needed. ( 36 ) Plus, the 2.1-gram serving of carnitine has been linked to increased muscle mass, accompanied by weight loss and reduced physical and mental fatigue. ( 28 ) All in all, we think Legion Recharge is a great pick for athletes who prioritize their time out of the gym just as much as their time in the gym. “I like that Legion included corosolic acid — not many creatine supplements do,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “Recharge’s formulation scores a 4.25 out of 5 in my book.” Athletes get multiple flavor options with this profile, as well. Our tester, a certified nutrition coach, tried the Strawberry Lemonade, noting that the taste was, “Really good, like this mixture of sweet and tart…” Taste scores a 5 out of 5, earning it a spot as one of the best tasting creatines we’ve analyzed. Also, this creatine powder was a breeze to blend up during trials. “I didn’t have any issue with solubility and didn’t notice any grittiness when taking sips,” says our tester. Our team gave this product a 5 out of 5 for solubility. One 30-serving container of Recharge is $44.99, which is about $1.50 per serving. As such, we had to give the cost a 3 out of 5 as you can easily find creatine supplements at $0.50 per serving (or less). That being said, this formula does include some beneficial post-workout ingredients, albeit with a more robust makeup than other creatine powders we’ve tried. One note: Watch out for the sweetener. “Legion Recharge is sweetened with stevia, which isn’t tolerated by everyone,” says Bourgeois. “Even the unflavored option includes the natural sweetener .” So, if you’re sensitive to added sweeteners, you may prefer a pick from one of the other best creatine brands, like Jacked Factory Creatine Monohydrate. Read our full Legion Recharge Review . This post workout supplement from Jacked Factory boasts a dose of creatine for muscle growth, l-carnitine l-tartrate for muscle recovery, and betaine anhydrous for power output. It also comes in a variety of flavors, from Watermelon to ‘Swoleberry’. Jacked Factory Growth Surge has 3,000 milligrams of creatine monohydrate and may promote muscle recovery and strength gain. ( 11 )( 7 ) Plus, there are multiple flavors to choose from, which can be ideal when trying to guzzle down creatine as a standalone supplement. Our tester, a certified nutrition coach, tried the Cherry Limeade offering and had some thoughts. “I really liked the flavor, but there was a little bit of an aftertaste.” It wasn’t enough to keep her from buying the product again, though — she still gave the taste a 5 out of 5 rating, making it one of the best tasting creatines in our lab. We like the addition of betaine, too, as it may help protect protein cells from environmental stress. ( 6 ) “Together, all of these ingredients work to improve blood flow and nitric oxide production to maximize your anaerobic performance,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, who gave the formulation a 4 out of 5. When it comes to mixing a drink for your training, though, we highly recommend giving Growth Surge a fair shake with your best shaker bottle (pun intended). “It mixed poorly and left a bunch of floating clumps of powder,” says our tester who gives solubility a 3 out of 5. For those who hate clumping or have issues gripping items, this may not be the best pick. The cost per serving on this creatine for bulking isn’t ideal for those on a budget, unfortunately. One 30-serving container costs $39.99, which is about $1.33 per serving. We had to give Jacked Factory a 1 out of 5 in this category, as you can definitely find cheaper options (like the Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate). However, if you want a top creatine with an enjoyable flavor profile, this should be worth considering. This Gainful supplement is a straightforward creatine monohydrate with a clinically-backed dose of 5,000 milligrams per serving. It’s also free of preservatives and any artificial flavors, dyes, or sweeteners. Lots of supplement companies offer subscriptions, but not all of them provide access to a registered dietitian. Gainful does, and that’s what makes it our pick for the best subscription-based creatine. After getting set up with a subscription, you can check with an R.D. to answer questions about creatine loading phases or additional benefits the supplement may offer. We think Gainful is perfect for those who want personalized advice on their supplement routine, but may not have the time or bandwidth to find an R.D. on their own. As for the product itself, it’s a straightforward creatine monohydrate with a clinically-backed dose of 5,000 milligrams per serving. “Most research suggests that 3 to 5 grams of creatine monohydrate is the ideal dose to maximize its benefits, and you get 5 grams with Gainful Creatine Monohydrate ,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, BarBend expert contributor and registered dietitian. It’s also free of preservatives and any artificial flavors, dyes, or sweeteners, so we’d recommend it for anyone with a sensitive stomach as well. In fact, our tester didn’t experience any bloating or GI discomfort after use. It’s only available in an Unflavored option, and our tester was pleased to report they didn’t taste it at all when mixing with milk. In terms of solubility, they noticed a bit of powder stuck to the side of their cup after mixing it with a handheld mixer, but overall experienced no issues. “After mixing it in a shaker cup, I let it sit for roughly an hour and didn’t notice any separation,” they add. Flavor received a 5 out of 5, while solubility scored a 4.5 out of 5. The cost per serving — around $0.86 — remains the same no matter which option you buy. While it’s not the most affordable creatine we’ve tested, the access to an R.D. helped bump up our value score to a 4 out of 5. Finally, while we admire Gainful’s commitment to clean ingredients, we wish this product had some mark of third-party testing that can provide the peace of mind that the label delivers what it promises and includes no banned substances. “Nothing stands out as a red flag with this creatine from Gainful, but it would be an added bonus if they sent the product for third-party testing to ensure safety and purity,” says Bourgeois. Because it’s not third-party certified, we wouldn’t recommend it for competitive athletes. If that’s you, try Sports Research Creatine instead. Thorne’s product packs 5 grams of creatine monohydrate per serving with zero fillers or additives. Plus, you can bundle with other Thorne products and save. Though having a variety of flavor options can be fun, supplement stackers usually prefer an unflavored creatine powder that blends easily with their best pre-workout supplement or other go-to powder. Thorne Creatine Monohydrate is a no-frills creatine supplement — it’s 5 grams of micronized creatine monohydrate per serving, and comes in a neutral unflavored powder. Our tester, a certified personal trainer, rated the taste (or lack thereof) a 5 out of 5 — we consider this a big win for Thorne, since a lot of “unflavored” powders aren’t truly unflavored. Therefore, we’d suggest this top creatine option for those who like to mix multiple supplement powders into one drink. This creatine is also a solid option for athletes, as it contains no ingredients outside of the creatine itself — you won’t find any additional carbs, fats, or calories in this blend. “You get the high end of what research suggests to be ideal for creatine doses,” according to our expert, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, who rated the formulation at 5 out of 5. “And there are no fluff ingredients that would drive up cost or skew its effects.” Of course, if you’re hoping to take your creatine pre-workout or want added vitamins or minerals in your supplement, this may not be the product for you. Unfortunately, the solubility wasn’t as ideal as we’d hoped, earning a 3-out-of-5 rating. “It settles a bit at the bottom of my glass,” our tester said. “I had to stir it several times while sipping. In a smoothie, though, I imagine it would be fine.” If exceptional solubility is a must for you, try Legion Recharge, instead. The 5-gram dose is right on par with other creatine monohydrates, and at roughly $0.46 per serving, our team gave the price per serving a score of 4 out of 5. It’s certainly not the priciest option on the market, but you can find even cheaper products. Read our full Thorne Creatine Review . For those who don’t want to add yet another powdered supplement to their usual stack, you can get creatine in pill form. Crazy Muscle’s Creatine Pills offer a three-type creatine blend. In some cases, adding yet another powder to your supplement stack may not be the most convenient. Luckily, you can get creatine in pill form, too, and for those who prefer a capsule over powder, we suggest Crazy Muscle Creatine Pills. “While they require you to swallow three pills to get the full dose, you do get 5,001 milligrams of creatine monohydrate per serving ,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN, says, giving the formula a 4 out of 5. “There’s just some curiosity as to why they include creatine alpha-ketoglutarate and creatine pyruvate when they’re so understudied.” As Bourgeois explains, there are three types of creatine in these pills. However, creatine monohydrate is really the form with the most supporting research. Nevertheless, the other two creatines are safe for most adults (always consult your doctor prior to starting a regimen), yet they may just not be as effective. We do like that this product is available through Amazon Prime, so there’s not much wait time — making it an ideal option for those who need fast shipping. Our team did give the swallow-ability a 3.5 out of 5, though. “The pills are easy enough to swallow,” says our tester, a certified nutrition coach, “However, sometimes I just don’t want to wash back a handful of pills.” The pills aren’t difficult to consume but you do have to take three per serving, which can be inconvenient, especially if you’re taking other capsulated supplements like the best multivitamins . You can also always consider creatine gummies, like Swoly. “This product is reasonably priced,” adds our tester. One 60-serving container costs $49.99, which is only about $0.83 per serving. For this, cost scores a 5 out of 5. This creatine is clean and simple. It comes with 2.5 grams of micronized creatine per serving, and you can buy it in bulk to save money. Plus, it’s tested both in-house and by a third party for any impurities. If you’re a beginner looking for a product that can potentially help boost your athletic performance, this top creatine pick is simple and — we think — a great starting point. “Bulk supplements did an excellent job with this creatine powder,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, MS, RDN, LD, giving the formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “You get five grams of micronized creatine and no added ingredients, so it’s incredibly simple.” Bulk Supplements Creatine is 100% pure creatine monohydrate and includes no other ingredients. This can be a great option for beginners, as it allows you to see how that ingredient alone may affect your performance and recovery. However, you do not get other benefits like post-workout support that may be present in more robust formulations. This one doesn’t have any flavor options, unfortunately. “It’s truly unflavored , and doesn’t have any bitter aftertaste,” says our tester, a certified nutrition coach. This may work well for a beginner trying new supplements, as it can stack well with the best BCAA supplements or protein powders. Our team gave the flavor a 4 out of 5. “However, I noticed this bag doesn’t come with a scooper,” our tester adds, which is a bit of a downside for those looking for a reliable measuring tool. We also like that Bulk Supplements offers capsules in addition to powdered creatine. Though you shouldn’t experience any issues with the solubility here, capsules are a nice alternative for those who need a more convenient option. You can choose from four capsule options, including either vegetarian or gelatin capsules at either 100 or 300 capsules per bottle. Other non-powder creatine options we like include the Crazy Muscle Creatine Pills or the Swoly Creatine Gummies. The powder comes in six buying options from three and a half ounces all the way up to 55 pounds. The price per serving will vary, depending on the size you get, but with max prices hovering near $0.25, it’s an easy selection for those on a budget. Needless to say, this one earned a 5 out of 5 for cost. Read our full Bulk Supplements Creatine Review . Jacked Factory’s Creatine Monohydrate is about as straightforward a creatine as it comes. There isn’t any added fluff or fillers, and it’s one of the best prices we’ve found on the market for a creatine monohydrate powder. Many companies try their hand at making a good creatine monohydrate supplement, but we think this one from Jacked Factory is top-notch for athletes who want a simple, no-frills creatine. Each serving of Jacked Factory’s simple creatine houses 5,000 milligrams of creatine monohydrate with no additional ingredients. “Jacked Factory Creatine Monohydrate easily gets a 4.5 out of 5 for formulation,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RDN. “You get exactly what you pay for — creatine without any alarming or unnecessary fillers .” Plus, it’s available in an Unflavored profile, so you can mix it with any beverage or stack it with other supplements. “It tastes like water to me,” states Kate Meier, NASM-CPT, USAW-L1, CF-L1, so you don’t necessarily need to mix with other ingredients, either. As such, she gave it a 5 out of 5 in the taste department. Flavored options are available (Blue Raspberry or Peach Mango), but if you’d prefer a larger menu of tastes, we’d recommend Transparent Labs Creatine HMB. While the flavorless profile is appealing, Meier did note that this Jacked Factory powder didn’t dissolve entirely — “There was a little sediment that gathered at the bottom over time,” she adds, giving the product a 4 out of 5 for solubility. Although specific creatine timing doesn’t necessarily matter, research suggests that taking creatine shortly before and/or after a workout can be beneficial. ( 29 ) So, keep an electric stirrer handy. We give the price per serving a solid 5 out of 5. One 85-serving container costs $34.99, which is only about $0.41 per serve, making it among our most cost-friendly choices. Plus, this one is available on Amazon Prime, so you can get your supplements in a matter of days. We have tested a lot of creatine, folks. Not every product is going to make our list, obviously, so we thought we’d include a few other products that made an impression. Check them out below. The BarBend team includes certified personal trainers, competitive athletes, and fitness enthusiasts with years of experience in the space. We tested more than 40 creatine products, examining the solubility, flavor, and price, among other factors to provide a well-rounded list. Using the BarBend supplement testing methodology, here are the factors we considered. Creatine is one of the few supplements on the market with a large number of studies supporting its effects. It may also have some serious benefits for your energy and power levels. Read a more in-depth analysis of each below. “ Besides helping the muscles to heal faster after strenuous workouts, some studies show that cognitive function may be improved especially as it pertains to depression ,” says Dr. Kimberly Langdon, M.D. When you’re ready to buy a creatine supplement, you may be overwhelmed given the breadth of assortment across the category. Fear not, though. Finding the ideal creatine supplement for your needs can be easy if you look at the right factors before adding a pick to your cart. We provide a pretty serious price range on this list with picks ranging from $0.08 per serving all the way up to $3 per dose. These prices fluctuate depending on the formulation, ingredient list, dosage, and type of creatine. The correct dosage varies depending on personal preference. Generally, a loading phase involves intaking 5 grams of creatine monohydrate (approximately 0.03 grams of creatine per kilogram of bodyweight) four times daily for five to seven days. Then, creatine stores can be maintained by intaking 3 to 5 grams daily. Some athletes can even take up to 10 grams of creatine daily if their activity levels call for it. ( 11 ) In general, it’s best to look for a creatine that’s going to provide you with an optimal amount of servings from the start. Do a little math to see how much creatine you’ll likely need for a given stretch, and try to find a pick that can facilitate your consumption without requiring re-orders on the regular. There are several types of creatine to choose from, and depending on your needs, one may be better suited than another. If budget and research-backed supplements are what drive you, creatine monohydrate may be your best bet. Micronized creatine is a more dissolvable formulation, meaning it has better mixability than other forms. ( 17 ) If you have a sensitive stomach, opting for a buffered formula or creatine with a different pH (such as kre-alkalyn) may be more digestible. You may also opt to use creatine HMB, which may help promote strength gains. ( 9 ) There is no right or wrong form of creatine but there is likely one pick that’s best for you. Creatine supplements come in pills, powders, or gummies. So, if you have a hard time swallowing pills, a powder or gummy may be your best bet. If you prefer to mix your creatine with your other supplements like beta-alanine or a post-workout supplement you may want to go with an unflavored powder option. Additionally, some creatine supplements come with other ingredients commonly used for pre- or post-workout supplements. Common ingredients paired with creatine are other amino acids, such as beta-alanine, taurine, or glutamine — but they can also have added vitamins and minerals like vitamin D, zinc, or magnesium. You may prefer a pre-workout or BCAA supplement where creatine is just one of many ingredients, or a supplement where creatine is the star of the show. This all depends on your goals, your preferences, and your budget. Also make sure your creatine supplement is free from excess additives and fillers. Plus, if you tend to have issues digesting supplements, try to avoid added and artificial sweeteners. Most likely, if you choose a pure creatine monohydrate powder, you won’t have to worry about added filler ingredients, though. Your creatine supplement of choice can range in price depending on extra additives, third-party testing, container size, and other factors. On average, though, you can expect to pay roughly $0.67 per serving for a high-quality supplement. Below are the comparative costs per serving for each creatine supplement featured in this round-up. Creatine has been widely researched and shown to be not only safe for most individuals, but also beneficial throughout your lifespan. ( 33 ) While you could argue that just about anyone can benefit from creatine, here are a few specific people who should supplement their daily diets with creatine: As the most widely-researched supplement on the market, creatine is regarded as safe for most everyone. Potential side effects can even be limited by keeping to the recommended dosage of 3 to 5 grams daily. ( 11 ) Nevertheless, certain individuals may want to consult their doctor or a licensed professional about its safety and efficacy before starting a new supplement: In the past, experts were concerned about creatine’s impact on kidney health and function, as it can increase creatinine levels, which is a potential sign of kidney damage. However, this common misconception has been debunked over the last couple of decades in studies. ( 35 ) Still, if you already have pre-existing kidney conditions, make sure to talk to your doctor first. Before adding any new supplement (even a pre-workout) to your regular routine, it’s best to consult a healthcare professional, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions. While creatine is a largely safe, well-researched supplement, according to the Mayo Clinic , there are some creatine side effects to consider. Creatine is a compound that’s found in your body’s muscles and brain. It helps your muscles use energy but it can also help with building strength, injury prevention, and overall brain health, according to the Mayo Clinic . Outside of supplements, you can find creatine in red meat and seafood. However, these foods contain far less creatine than supplements. So, many people tend to opt for a creatine powder, capsule, or gummy. It’s usually fine for most people to take daily, but we suggest checking with your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement or exercise routine. You absolutely can. Many people prefer to take creatine, especially unflavored creatines, with their protein shakes or smoothies to make it a bit more palatable. Feel free to mix away! We’re fans of Transparent Labs Creatine HMB, as creatine monohydrate is far and away the most researched and best-supported form of creatine. Dozens and dozens of studies support it; no other form of creatine has more than five studies. There’s no evidence any of the other forms, like creatine hydrochloride, nitrate, Kre-Alkalyn, (and so on) are more effective. The main exception is if creatine monohydrate gives you stomach cramps. If this is the case, a form like hydrochloride or nitrate might be easier on your belly. In short, no . Loading creatine involves taking 20 to 25 grams per day for the first week, dropping down to 5 or 10 grams for a few weeks, followed by one or two weeks off. Then, repeat. Loading may saturate your muscles a little more quickly, but it’s not necessary. Just taking the standard three to five grams per day is sufficient to see results. ( 31 ) The effects of creatine accumulate over time. As far as timing goes in relation to your workouts, if you want to have particularly saturated muscles during exercise, creatine can be taken 30 to 45 minutes before exercise. However, studies have shown that taking creatine post-workout is better overall for body composition and strength. ( 23 ) Education View All Articles BarBend is an independent website.

    "text": "“Eat more.” That’s what most fresh-faced trainees hear when they ask the big guy in the weight room how to move up a couple shirt sizes. While not the most poetic way to explain muscle growth, “eat more” does get to the core of the issue — if you want to get big, you’ve got to eat bigger. Adding muscle is absolutely about mastering your caloric intake, but you also need to dial in your workouts as tightly as your macronutrients. Unfortunately, muscle doesn’t grow itself. You’ve got to work hard in the gym (and manage your recovery) to move the scale. Since you’re presumably not going to the gym to lose muscle, we’re going to teach you how to gain it the right way. This is everything you need to know about bulking, and how to do it properly. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it shouldn’t take the place of advice and/or supervision from a medical professional. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. Speak with your physician if you have any concerns. “Bulking up” has been common parlance in bodybuilding since before Arnold Schwarzenegger inspired an entire generation to hit the iron. While the word “bulking” may conjure images of a muscle-bound lifter in a stringer tank, the practice is simply the act of putting on lean muscle mass over time . Bulking is not about adding body weight . The distinction is essential — adding additional muscle to your frame will increase your weight on the scale, but putting on excess fat moves the needle without necessarily making you look better in the mirror. Much like hitting your first pull-up , gaining quality muscle mass is simple in theory and challenging in practice. A proper bulk requires attention to detail both in the kitchen and the weight room. Fortunately, when it comes to the fundamentals of weight gain, everything boils down to simple math. To bulk up, you have to consume more calories than your body burns on a regular basis. There’s almost no way to outsmart thermodynamics. Unless you’re completely new to resistance training or have been away for a very extended period, it is largely impossible to add lean body mass without a caloric surplus. Increasing the surplus of calories you consume will result in faster gains in body weight, but you’re likely to run into diminishing returns with regard to additional muscle gain specifically. Research supports the idea that a moderate surplus of 300 – 500 extra calories per day is sufficient to put on “clean” weight. ( 1 ) Some individuals may need a bit more or a bit less, but it’s a good place to start. Even with the right surplus of calories, temper your expectations for muscle gain. Those newer to lifting weights can expect to put on muscle weight quickly, but even athletes in their first year shouldn’t expect to add more than .5-1 pound of new tissue per month. The quantity of calories determines your rate of weight gain, but the composition affects the quality of that weight. Broad recommendations for protein intake have gone unchanged for well over 50 years, but modern literature has mostly arrived at the conclusion that increasing dietary protein above standard recommendations has a positive dose-response relationship with gaining muscle . ( 2 ) If you want to gain muscle, your caloric intake should also contain a sufficient amount of carbohydrates . While carbs don’t directly influence scale weight — contrary to popular belief — they do strongly affect resistance training performance , which is your catalyst for muscle gain. ( 3 ) Dietary fat, while somewhat less important for facilitating muscle gain than protein, is the most calorically-dense macronutrient. Fat comes in at nine calories per gram , making it an extremely efficient means of meeting your calorie benchmark . ( 4 ) It’s also far less satiating than protein and is found in most meat, poultry, and dairy foods, so it can be quite easy to overdo it on fat intake. You need to put down sufficient calories weekly to change the number on the scale. To ensure that weight gain is mostly lean mass and not spare fat, your caloric intake has to be properly calibrated. Your “training age” — the number of years you’ve spent dedicated to lifting — also influences your nutrition. Research suggests that the more advanced you are in your gym career, the more precision is required with your diet. If you’re new to the gym, you can afford to be more liberal with your caloric surplus, a luxury not afforded to advanced bodybuilders. ( 4 ) Fortunately, this macro calculator takes the guesswork out of the equation — all you have to do is plug your information in. If calories and macronutrients are the building blocks of muscle gain, your training is how you put those materials to use. Without the right workout program , you might find yourself with a big pile of bricks and no structure to show for it. There are plenty of good programs to pull from, but guidance on how to approach your workouts while bulking isn’t as readily available. To get the most out of your hours in the gym and put all those calories to good use, there are a few things to keep in mind. Making steady progress with your body should be at the forefront of your mind throughout a bulking phase. This may sound obvious, but it can be all too easy to get wrapped up in the details and forget the big picture. If you’re trying to grow your legs and your squat numbers are going up, you’re getting a good pump in the gym, and you’re recovering adequately between workouts, there’s no need to make too many tweaks or changes to your form or program. Pursue perfection in technique, sure, but don’t fix what isn’t broken. There’s a prevailing — and somewhat disingenuous — narrative in the fitness industry that lifting weights and cardio training are incompatible, and that to gain weight in the right places, you need to swear off the treadmill or track altogether. Like all fitness myths, there’s a nugget of truth in the center. Research backs the existence of a so-called “interference effect,” in which mixing both modalities at the same time can dampen the body’s metabolic response to either. However, this metabolic “interference” doesn’t appear to hold true across all forms of cardio and seems to be more of an issue with high-impact, high-calorie-burn exercise like running or circuit training. ( 5 ) Cardio can help speed up recovery from training , but it also burns calories. Since you want most of your intake directed towards repairing and building new muscle tissue, easing up on your weekly cardio is probably smart, especially if you’re running a conservative surplus. If you do want to leave a cardio session in your training plan, pick something low-impact and with limited eccentric tension, like cycling or swimming. Stick to one or two sessions per week if you don’t want to increase your caloric consumption to accommodate the extra physical activity. One of the most well-backed positions in physical training is that muscle growth positively correlates with training volume . Put simply, challenging your body to do more work in the gym will necessitate more muscle growth. Still, this is only true up to a point. There’s enormous individual variability in tolerance to lifting volumes, and it is hard to fill a cup that is already full. In fact, piling on extra sets when you’re only just keeping up with your current workload can be counterproductive and even halt muscle growth altogether. ( 6 ) Training on a bulk affords you the luxury of increasing your volume to make more gains, but that isn’t the only avenue to cannonball delts or carved hamstrings. Increasing intensity on compound exercises , cutting down on rest times, or adding a few specialized techniques like drop sets or cluster work can help spur new gains without asking too much of your body. When you’re a few weeks or months into your first (or second, or third) bulking phase, it’s easy to feel unstoppable in the gym. An abundance of calories, carbohydrates, and protein to fuel your workouts probably makes you feel like you could handle a 500-pound deadlift with ease. Remember, though, that your training is only as effective as your recovery. The hours between when you step through your gym’s doors are when muscle is built back bigger and stronger. Following bouts of resistance training, skeletal muscle requires between 48 and 72 hours to bounce back for another round, and potentially longer if you’re middle-aged. ( 7 ) To that end, make sure you’re taking at least one or two days a week off from the weights. You can still hit up some active recovery or mobility work to ensure your next session is even better than the last. If a picture-perfect physique came in a pill or tub, gyms the world over would go out of business. Fortunately for gym owners — and unfortunately for everyone else — getting the physique of your dreams takes hard work and heavy weights. That said, there are some useful bulking supplements to consider if your diet and training are already laced up. Arm day may be a breeze, but no one feels great on their fifth set of deadlifts. Even with more calories than you need, hard training is just that. A good pre-workout supplement should provide a welcome energy boost in the gym so you can get the most out of every set. When analyzing pre-workout supplements, the most important ingredient by far is caffeine content . Some companies pack their products full of compounds and chemicals with little to no tangible scientific backing, but caffeine’s legitimacy as a strength-and-power enhancer is rock solid. ( 8 ) Like training volume, more isn’t necessarily better when it comes to caffeine — so make sure you’re dosing it properly. Creatine has a well-earned reputation in the health and fitness industry. There’s a reason creatine monohydrate is a staple in nearly every supplement stack on the market — it’s safe and it works. Hundreds of scientific papers have corroborated the effects of creatine supplementation on resistance training. A five-gram serving daily is heavily linked to better performance in the weight room with essentially no side effects whatsoever. ( 9 ) Before you fall prey to any of the broscience, know that you probably aren’t getting adequate creatine from your regular diet, no matter how carnivorous you are. Creatine is denatured when exposed to heat, rendering it largely ineffective. If you want to reap the benefits, you’ve got to get it as a powder. There’s also no need to “load” creatine, or consume extra dosages over a short period of time. The best way to benefit from creatine’s effects is to be consistent and let it help your gym performance long-term. A protein supplement may also be a wise choice if you’re having a hard time with a bulking diet. If you’re not used to heaping portions, the prospect of consuming hundreds of grams of protein per day can be a bit of a stomach-turner. The benefits of various types of protein powders are well-documented, but there are two critical factors to remember. First, the majority of your macronutrient intake should come from whole food sources to ensure you’re getting plenty of fiber and other valuable micronutrients. Supplements are not meant to replace your diet altogether. Further, you needn’t worry too much about the proverbial “anabolic window.” While many supplement companies tout the importance of dosing their products at just the right time, the literature broadly refutes the idea that timely protein intake is a major factor in muscle growth. As long as you’re getting it in throughout the day, you’re good to go. ( 10 ) Mass gainers, living up to their namesake, can be incredibly useful for gaining muscle mass, but only if you truly need them. Despite the alluring name, mass gainer supplements don’t possess any unique characteristics that make them indispensable for hypertrophy. [Read More: Best Upper Chest Exercises for Building Muscle] What they do have, though, is a truckload of calories. Since the science supports the idea that even seasoned physique competitors sometimes need extra-high amounts of calories to make progress ( 4 ), mass gainers can come in clutch if the number on the scale just isn’t going up. If you’re consistently plateauing with your weight gain efforts and shudder at the idea of adding another whole meal into your daily plan, you might want to pick up a tub. One of the biggest problems with vitamins is that they’re not particularly ergogenic. When they’re working, you won’t really notice. However, depending on the quality of your diet or meal plan, you might notice their absence. Bulking up sometimes requires eating when you aren’t hungry, something that can be extra challenging if you’re dedicated to nutritious, fiber-rich foods and vegetables. Getting a portion of your daily calories from “junk food” is fine within reason. If you’re worried about the effects a not-so-clean diet has on your health, covering your bases with a good multivitamin might be a wise investment. Bear in mind, though, that it is not nearly as effective for stimulating growth or performance as creatine or whey protein. On the surface, running a bulk is as simple as filling up your plate with your favorite foods. In reality, there’s a lot more going on behind the veil of a successful weight gain protocol. However, that also means there are a few potential pitfalls to watch out for. For some people, it is easier to adhere to a diet centered around restriction instead of abundance. A caloric “ceiling” is straightforward enough — you’re allowed a certain number per day, and that’s it. But when bulking up, it can be far too easy to go over your caloric target, since doing so isn’t as strictly detrimental to your goals. An extra scoop (or tub) of ice cream at night can feel like no big deal, since you’re trying to gain weight anyway. Playing fast and loose with your calorie ceiling over time can leave you with far more extra body fat than you originally wanted at the conclusion of your bulk. To keep fat gain under control, take your bulking calories as seriously as you would a fat loss diet . Weigh yourself regularly so you have an objective figure that reflects your subjective habits. Anyone can demolish a buffet after a long diet — whether it’s for a bodybuilding show or beach season. When consuming an exorbitant number of calories becomes a daily ritual on a bulk, those extra portions no longer seem as appetizing. Large, calorically-dense meals can be particularly taxing to put down if you’re dedicated to eating “clean,” incorporating fibrous vegetables and low-glycemic-index carbohydrates at each meal, as those food groups are very satiating but lower in calories. To avoid painfully stuffing your face when you’re not hungry, eat smaller meals more often. If you need to pack in extra calories at each meal, ante up your sauce and condiment usage. Including things like coconut oil in your cooking can help you stack up calories fast while also getting in some healthy fats to boot. The old adage that you can’t have too much of a good thing doesn’t extend to your diet. In fact, overstaying your welcome with respect to your bulk might have more detrimental effects than padding a bit more fat than intended. Prolonged caloric surpluses are widely reported to increase insulin resistance, even in populations who regularly lift weights. ( 11 ) While not directly correlated, extended periods of overfeeding and the accompanying changes in insulin sensitivity may negatively impact the rate of muscle gain over time. ( 12 ) In practical terms, this means that your bulking phase may be less effective the longer you run it. To ensure you get the most bang for your buck, limit the duration of your bulks to a couple of months at a time. Muscle doesn’t come easy. If you aren’t eating well or training hard enough, it probably isn’t coming at all. Building an impressive physique takes large portions of patience and diligence, and the right bodybuilding supplements to boot. But if you approach bulking the right way — by eating enough, working out like you mean it, and prioritizing your recovery — all those extra meals will add up to extra inches on your arms, chest, and thighs. Gaining muscle is never easy, but it’s always worth the effort. 1. Leaf, A., & Antonio, J. (2017).

    "text": "Anyone in the strength sports world who isn’t training in a cave has surely heard of the keto diet . You know, the diet that lets you eat all the bacon and avocado that you can stomach while shedding fat , maintaining muscle , and still dominating your sport — all you have to do is give up carbs. But will it make you stronger ? The ketogenic diet hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down since bursting onto the mainstream years ago, and it’s still one of the hottest nutrition trends. And while there are many supposed benefits — like making our Navy Seals even deadlier — there’s still some debate on whether or not it can aid strength athletes. Below, we’ll dive a little deeper into that debate and determine whether athletes can get stronger on a low- or no-carb diet, and if ketosis will help them during their next meet. The ketogenic diet , or keto as it’s more commonly known, is a high-fat diet designed to keep the body in a near-constant state of ketosis, a metabolic state where the body creates ketones from fat to use as energy instead of sugar from carbs (the body’s primary and preferred energy source). A typical keto diet has 70 percent of your overall calories from fat, 25 percent from protein, and just five percent (about 50 grams) from carbohydrates — though some versions nix carbs altogether.  Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. None of these supplements are meant to treat or cure any disease. If you feel you may be deficient in a particular nutrient or nutrients, please seek out a medical professional. Generally, your body will begin producing ketones for fuel a few days after you stop eating carbs — a sure sign is when your breath starts to smell of acetone, a ketosis by-product. Incidentally, it kind of stinks like a mixture of fruit and nail polish remover, in which acetone is a key ingredient. (Note: The only true way to know if you’re in ketosis is to test your ketone levels, which you can do with urine strips, a breathalyzer, or a blood ketone testing kit.) But don’t worry — acetone is actually a ketone, and while it’s also synthetically made in labs, it’s also naturally produced in the body. These acetones are a backup energy source for the body. The body prefers carbs, which are digested and then broken down into glucose and converted into energy. Without substantial glucose, the body needs to find a way to continue providing energy to our vital organs (mostly, our brain). In that sense, there are two forms of ketosis: natural ketosis and nutritional ketosis. Natural ketosis occurs when someone hasn’t eaten carbs in a while — so if you’re on a rigorous hike and forget to pack food, ketosis will kick in as a survival mechanism. Nutritional ketosis, on the other hand, is when ketosis is forced through diet. Dr. Mike T. Nelson , CSCS, an adjunct professor at the Carrick Institute, whose Ph.D. focused on metabolic flexibility, breaks it down a little more. “If you look at one of the main fuels the body can burn, carbohydrates and fat are the main two, and a layer down are the sort of ‘subfuels,’ lactate and ketones,” he says. “Historically, ketones have not shown up in the body in enough quantities for the body to use unless you’re starving. But you can get there via the ketogenic diet. When you do that, your body will start producing ketones, which can be used for fuel. Then you’re in a state of ketosis. Although first suggested as a therapeutic tool by the Mayo Clinic in the 1920s, it wasn’t until the late 20th century that ketosis gained popularity to treat epilepsy and other brain disorders. Some research has shown that more than half of children with epilepsy who go on the diet experience at least 50 percent fewer seizures. That’s always been its main use: therapeutic. There’s also some shakier evidence that it can help the body fight cancerous tumors and prevent diabetes. ( 1 ) It’s benefits like these that have spurred some corners of the health and fitness industry to try and stay in ketosis in their day-to-day lives. Author and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss has claimed it helped cure him of Lyme disease, and he continues to cycle ketogenic phases to this day. Celebrities like podcast host Joe Rogan , Jersey Shore’s Vinny “the Keto Guido” Guadagnino, and Lebron James have also tried the diet. It may also help folks to burn more fat while retaining muscle . The promise of a ripped middle mainly caused six-pack aficionados to perk up and the diet to spread like wildfire. From there came communities like Ketogains, where some members can be found swearing up and down, but eliminating carbs increases performance and aesthetics to unprecedented levels. [Read More: The Best Ab Exercises & Workouts, According to a CPT] The problem is that while there’s some evidence that ketosis may not be detrimental for some endurance athletes, there’s very, very little clinical evidence as to whether or not it can benefit strength athletes. But we know enough about how the body uses different energy systems to have a pretty good idea. The short answer: when you’re working with low reps. Strength athletes who only have to eke out one to three reps utilize the body’s ATP-CP energy system, which provides small amounts of energy in quick bursts. It’s the first energy source utilized by the body during any exercise, and it’s enough if you’re not working out for extended periods of time. ( 2 ) “Since we don’t have a lot of direct data, you have to ask what energy source are strength athletes using?” says Nelson. “If we look at Olympic lifting and powerlifting, it’s extremely explosive power, the duration of time is concise, so it’s primarily the ATP-CP energy system. So, ketosis in those athletes may be OK because they’re typically doing brief high output with pretty long rest periods.” He explains that if you’re keeping sets between roughly one and three reps with long rest periods of three to five minutes, this may be long enough to regenerate the ATP levels (a method of intracellular energy transfer) even if you’re in ketosis. However, more volume would require carbohydrates to replenish the body’s energy stores that kick in once ATP-CP has been exhausted. “So I would say keto is OK — not great — but it’s OK during peaking phases where volume is very low, and you have a very high-intensity effort as opposed to high volume,” says Dr. Mike Israetel , an assistant professor of nutrition, exercise science, and public health at Temple University and co-founder of fitness company Renaissance Periodization. “The higher the total volume of work you perform in training, the more you’re going to rely on glycogen and carbohydrate to potentiate that performance. In strength sports, because the work is typically not as high in duration, people can get away with lower carbs in general.” High-rep activity causes energy systems to rely on carbohydrates, so keto isn’t the best choice for strength sports that require lots of volume. That means anyone focusing on functional fitness, CrossFit , strongman , bodybuilding , and any strength sport with high volume should probably stay away from keto. “The higher the volume of training, the worse keto starts to perform,” Israetel continues, saying that he would even caution against it for sets of more than six reps. “CrossFit is maybe the worst category of sports for which you should try to do keto. It’s an incredibly terrible mismatch.” When exercising at a high intensity between one and three minutes, the body primarily uses the glycolytic energy system, which — as the name suggests — runs off of glucose, which comes from carbs. If you’re in ketosis, your glycolytic system isn’t running properly, and your performance suffers. Interestingly enough, people on keto don’t necessarily have low glycogen levels in their muscles. However, if you’re in ketosis and your body thinks it needs to run on ketones, you may not be able to use those stored carbohydrates effectively. Even if your body has all the pieces to run its glycolytic system, it won’t. (At least not well.) “It’s an access issue, not the amount that’s being stored,” says Nelson. “It’s like a gas tanker truck being pulled over at the side of the road because it’s out of gas. It’s not like there’s no gas in the tanker truck. It’s that there’s no direct line to the engine.“ While the volume is typically a little lower, the same rules apply for strongman; It’s a sport that typically requires 30 to 90 seconds of more or less continuous output, which means it’s an energy system that runs best on carbs. “As the events turn from the shorter events to the longer events like stone loading, log for reps, deadlift for reps, you would pay for ketosis,” says Israetel. “You’ll have a couple of reps missed on everything. It’s not recommended for performance.” Endurance runners can sometimes manage well on ketosis because their sport is performed at a relatively low intensity, so an athlete can have some pretty decent performance using ketones as fuel. It’s also important to note that while it may facilitate fat loss, ketosis is probably lousy for muscle gain . That’s in part because insulin, despite misconceptions that it should be minimized at all costs, is actually highly anabolic. “In bodybuilding circles where low-carb diets like keto are the most popular, you’ll see an interesting relationship where they’re very popular but only in fat loss stages,” says Israetel. “But in muscle gain phases, very few bodybuilders stay on low carbs.” Short answer: No. In some corners of the fitness world, runners will train in ketosis to help their bodies better learn to use fat stores for energy, and then, right before a race, they’ll consume a huge serving of carbohydrates. The idea is that the athlete will then be able to efficiently use both forms of fuel that have been adapted to other endurance sports, and while it’s a nice theory, it doesn’t really hold up in practice. “Research didn’t see much of a performance change, and that’s probably because they gave them a whole ton of carbohydrates while the machinery to use them effectively was impaired,” says Nelson, who notes that the right enzymes to use carbohydrates effectively were not present in high enough amounts. “It probably takes at least a couple of days and maybe a few weeks before those enzymes are back up and running at full steam.” ( 3 ) Two of the hottest fitness trends may actually be able to work in conjunction with each other, at least according to Nelson. There are no studies examining the effect of combining keto and intermittent fasting , but he claims his clients have been able to use better both forms of fuel (carbs and ketones) if they fast for a portion of the day. “We know that the ability to use fat during rest and low-intensity exercise is highly variable, ranging from 23 to 93 percent,” he says. “So some can use it much more effectively than others. If I think someone’s ability to use fat is impaired, I’ll have them do periods of fasting of up to twenty-four hours or even longer to get that acute change in fat use without messing up their ability to use carbohydrates to the highest degree.” ( 4 ) He has his clients do long, slow, aerobic fasted training once or twice per day to minimize insulin and train their bodies to use fat as much as possible without producing the kind of enzyme changes seen in ketogenic athletes that can reduce the ability to use carbohydrates. “I can give them carbs the very next day, and they can still use them to a high degree,” he continues. “So I’m not screwing up their ability to do strength and power-type activities.” To recap, there are sometimes that keto might be OK for strength athletes and others when it should be avoided. “People have been looking for the unique benefits of cutting carbohydrates out for a long time, and outside of some benefits in diseased populations, people with epilepsy, etc., there are just no benefits. It just won’t happen,” says Israetel. “Not surprisingly, there’s no big potentiation effect in anything when you remove something from your diet. So I think that the situation with keto is, can it work in some places where it’s not terrible? Yes. Is it an enhancer? I’ve never seen anything it enhances outside of some disease conditions.” We love bacon as much as the next person, but maybe don’t forget the home fries.

    "text": "Weight loss, whether for aesthetic or performance-related reasons, is an extremely common fitness goal . While you may have run a successful diet and dropped some spare pounds, you might be left wondering what to do after. Some literature suggests that weight loss protocols often result in subsequent major weight gain if you don’t rebound properly and that a calorie deficit , while integral, is potentially harmful if continued in perpetuity. ( 1 ) If you’ve worked hard in the kitchen and the gym for months to hit a certain weight, only to rapidly gain it back, was all the restriction really worth it? Luckily, reverse dieting allows you to recover from a period of caloric restriction in a sustainable way, and might just be the key to running successful weight cuts long-term. This guide will teach you everything you need to know about how to do a reverse diet safe l y and effectively. A reverse diet is basically the opposite of a typical diet . Instead of slowly reducing calories over several weeks to try and lose weight, a reverse diet has you slowly and methodically adding back the calories you’ve taken away, typically from carbs and fat . The goal of the reverse diet is to slowly get your nutritional intake back to maintenance levels or slightly above, without gaining a whole bunch of fat in the process. Adding back calories this way, in theory, should help account for some of the negative metabolic adaptations you may have experienced when dieting, such as dampened energy levels, suppressed hormones, or lethargy. It sounds simple enough, but like all things you do in the world of nutrition, there’s a right and a wrong way to go about it, especially if you’re too conservative about bouncing back. ( 2 ) A reverse diet is not a “ bulk .” The goal of a reverse diet is not to gain back a bunch of mass after dieting and it does not mean stuffing your face with any and everything that has calories. A reverse diet is more of a slow and controlled approach to get your body back to baseline efficiency over time. A reverse diet still involves the tracking of your intake. If you’re looking for a blank check in the kitchen and a complete reprieve from nutritional tracking of any sort, it ultimately may be what’s best for you if you’re done with a weight cut and want to enjoy more calories — and thus higher performance in the gym . If you’ve got some experience with shedding fat or to make weight at a powerlifting meet , the process of a reverse diet should be quite intuitive. In essence, all you’re doing is retracing your steps. Here are those exact steps broken down for you. Unfortunately, relying on your memory is not going to cut it. To successfully reverse diet, you need to track your intake to properly account for what you ate on the day. Most nutritional tracking apps work just fine and can provide additional useful information, but whatever method you used to get down to your current weight will probably suffice. Remember, though, that precision is key. To gain weight slowly and steadily without “undoing” most of your hard-earned weight change, your caloric benchmarks have to be tightly calibrated. However, before you begin in earnest, understand that a reverse diet doesn’t guarantee that you won’t regain any body fat at all following a diet. If you’ve been dieting, you should know roughly how many calories you have been eating, but make sure you have consistently tracked your calorie intake and averaged your body weights for a week or two to get a true picture of where you’re at with your nutrition. Once you’ve determined that your current caloric intake is maintaining your weight , it’s time to sprinkle in some extra nutrition to kickstart the weight gain process. Aim for a very conservative increase on your current intake, at least to begin with — some sources recommend a very modest increase of one to five percent — at the onset. ( 3 ) If you aren’t sure about where you’re at with your caloric needs, this is the time to hit up a handy calculator that does much of the work for you. Exercise: 15-30 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Intense exercise: 45-120 minutes of elevated heart rate activity. Very intense exercise: 2+ hours of elevated heart rate activity. Protein is arguably the most important macronutrient for a reverse diet due to its effects on muscle maintenance and hypertrophy . Establishing your protein intake should come first, and you should aim for anywhere between 1.8 and 2.4 grams per kilogram of body weight . Dietary fat follows and is essential for healthy bodily function. Get your bases covered by making dietary fat 20 to 35% of your total caloric intake . Finally, the remainder of your leftover calories should come from hearty carbohydrate sources . However, there’s some flexibility here. If you want more fat or protein and fewer carbs , you’re free to modify your macros as long as you’re hitting the minimum dosages. Ultimately, a sample reverse diet for an 80-kilogram athlete, whose maintenance calories are 2600 per day, could look something like this: The most straightforward way of keeping tabs on your reverse diet is to weigh yourself several times per week and then take a weekly average. While a noticeable bump in body weight is expected, particularly if you’re incorporating many more carbs than you’re previously used to, you can adjust your total intake on an as-needed basis. Increases in water retention and muscle glycogen will generally result in a several-pound bump on the scale in just a week or two; remember to stay objective as much as possible and look at broader trends rather than single-instance fluctuations. If you’re monitoring your progress with the scale, make sure you always weigh yourself under similar conditions — ideally in the morning after using the restroom and before you’ve consumed any food or water . Beyond the scale , look to your performance in the gym to guide your progress. Any increase in caloric intake above maintenance levels should yield noticeable performance bumps in the squat rack or on the deadlift platform , and a conservative surplus should mean little fat regain along the way, despite not looking as “cut” in the mirror. In fact, if you’re quite lean and embarking on your first reverse diet, it may be wise to avoid dwelling on what you see in the mirror. Overly concerning yourself with maintaining a certain exact physique can perpetuate body image issues in some cases. ( 4 ) It’s not a magic bullet, but a well-planned reverse diet can do a lot to ease you out of an aggressive weight cut and get you back in the game in the gym . Adding back in calories means getting to eat more food! Taking a moderate, sustainable approach to increasing your food intake should also keep fat gain to a minimum while maximizing your quality of life and general mood . More food generally means a higher maintenance calorie level, as well. Suppressed caloric intake for an extended period of time can be mentally draining . It can cause you to feel sluggish, tired, and irritable at times. Reverse dieting allows you to gracefully exit your caloric deficit, which should afford some psychological relief especially if you’ve been dieting down for months. A common error at the conclusion of a diet is to jump right back into your old eating habits, significantly increasing the amount of calories you’re consuming. This typically results in rapid weight gain, prompting another phase of restriction, and so on. However, a well-thought-out reverse diet circumvents this and can help you steadily and reliably move up in weight without such heavy swings on the scale. Moreover, reverse dieting enables you to find value in moving toward, and staying at, a period of maintenance. Many people tend to think that nutritional control means constantly gaining or losing — don’t overlook the value of sticking to a sustainable weight range and reaping the health benefits that accompany it. A reverse diet isn’t right for everyone. If you simply cut your calories a little bit for a couple of weeks, you probably don’t need a reverse diet. If you stopped drinking soda or eating added sugars and this caused a caloric deficit resulting in you losing weight, you most likely don’t need a reverse diet. A reverse diet is for those who have been in a severe caloric deficit over a long stretch of time. Bodybuilders /physique athletes would benefit from a reverse diet after getting done with contest preparation. These competitors often drop their calories to very low levels so that they can get as lean as possible. This significant decrease in calories can negatively impact their metabolic rate and make them more susceptible to weight gain post-show. A reverse diet can largely minimize this by acclimating you to the idea that increasing your caloric intake is safe and productive. A bodybuilder or physique competitor who just wrapped up their show is a prime candidate for a reverse diet. Getting stage-ready-lean means dropping your calories to very, very low levels. This tends to go hand-in-hand with a dampened metabolic rate, and can make you susceptible to weight gain if your caloric reintroduction isn’t properly managed. If you consider yourself a “yo-yo dieter”, hopping from one diet or mean plan to another, a reverse diet is right up your alley. Cycling between restriction and “over”-indulgence can have a negative impact on both metabolic and psychological well-being, ( 3 ) making it hard for you to truly assess your nutritional needs. A controlled reverse diet should provide a much-needed baseline from which to make informed nutritional decisions and, perhaps more importantly, accept that increasing your caloric intake is okay. Even if you’ve been eating a truly scant amount of calories for months, it is possible that the scale won’t budge any further. If you’ve hit a weight loss plateau , stepping back might actually allow you to move forward. A controlled increase of calories can do a lot for your metabolism over time as well as bring some much-needed mental relief . Even though a reverse diet may slow your weight loss progress in the short term, you’ll be better off in the long run. What happens after you have achieved your goals with reverse dieting? Do you begin another diet? Do you continue to meticulously track your intake forever? Well, that all depends. If you’ve been rigorously monitoring your intake for a while, it may bring you some peace to back off of tight tracking and work on mindful eating habits . Evaluating your satiety during meals, eating slower and savoring your food, and enjoying your favorite treats in moderation can all benefit your mind and body in the long-term. If you’d like to hop on a bulk to pack on some extra muscle in the future, you absolutely can, and the same goes for adopting another weight loss plan. The luxury of the reverse diet is that it cleans your plate for you and allows you to make any move you want with your nutrition afterwards. Reverse diets are far more logical than they may sound at first, especially if you haven’t increased your caloric intake in a long while. If you’re at the bottom of a long, arduous weight cut or have simply been diet-hopping for a bit too long, a good reverse diet will help get your nutritional practices under control. Instead of doing a hard turn-around back to your old eating habits, reverse dieting can set you up for success in the kitchen — which will pay dividends in the gym. Getting back to a sustainable caloric level while helping you maintain the positive effects of your diet period, can make your hard-fought efforts all the more worthwhile.

    "text": "A gram per kilogram of bodyweight. A gram per pound of bodyweight. Fifty grams per day for everyone, that’s what the FDA recommends. Why is it so hard to agree on how much protein you need to consume? A lot of it has to do with the fact that protein is essential for building muscle , a lot of people want as much muscle as possible, so it stands to reason that they should consume as much protein as they can stomach. But of course, biochemistry isn’t quite so “reasonable” and the body is more complicated than “If hitting the recommended intake of this intake does that, then eating ten times that amount would be ten times the benefit!” (That’s why vitamin toxicity is a thing. Even too much broccoli can be bad for your thyroid. But we digress.) Let’s grind this beef: what’s the ideal amount of protein to eat per day? Editor’s Note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice . When starting a new training regimen and/or diet, it is always a good idea to consult with a trusted medical professional. We are not a medical resource. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. They are not substitutes for consulting a qualified medical professional. OK, we need to contextualize this. There’s the amount of protein you need to function (the FDA’s 50-gram guideline), the amount of protein you need to gain or retain muscle, and of course your protein needs vary depending on your activity, body composition , and age. The old “gram per pound” rule is easy to remember but probably inaccurate. A lot of research has suggested that the ideal minimum intake for muscle gain is more like 1.6 grams per kilogram of bodyweight , or 0.72 grams per pound. Perhaps the most influential paper on this was published by the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and the American College of Sports Medicine in 2009, all of whom suggested somewhere between 1.2 and 1.7 grams per kilogram for active individuals.( 1 ) “The 1.6 grams is your floor, essentially that’s your target to hit,” says Brian St. Pierre, MS, RD, the Director of Performance Nutrition at Precision Nutrition. “If your goal is muscle gain, the evidence doesn’t really suggest that eating more protein than that helps you gain more muscle but what it does to tend to show is that eating more than that may help to mitigate fat gain.” Part of this has to do with the thermic effect of food: you burn more calories just by digesting protein than you do carbs and fat. A 2004 study in Nutrition and Metabolism found that the thermic effect of protein is 20 to 30 percent, carbs are 5 to 10 percent, and fat 0 to 3 percent.( 2 ) That’s not the only reason you might reduce fat gain by going higher protein, but to be honest, we may not yet fully understand the mechanisms. “When people hear that, however, they’ll go protein crazy and won’t eat enough carbs or fat to meet their activity levels,” cautions St. Pierre. “That’s when you can have trouble, because they’re not eating enough carbs to maintain activity or enough fat to maintain hormone status . So you can have more carbs and fat.” He points to a pretty highly regarded 2014 study by Dr. Jose Antonio in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition , that found that giving athletes 4.4 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight wasn’t any better for body composition.( 3 ) Carbs and fat are important, too. Now, how much carbohydrate and fat should make up the rest of your macros is beyond the scope of this article but you should remember that eating a lot of excess calories will cause fat gain and not eating enough carbs or fat will hamper your mood, performance, and recovery. Keeping all that in mind should keep you from going too nuts on the protein . If all that sounds a little vague, it’s worth emphasizing that research is still a little conflicting on this. If you’re in caloric excess and really aiming to gain a lot of muscle as fast as possible, that old gram of protein per pound of bodyweight schtick might indeed be a good rule of thumb. That said, it’s very unlikely that you’ll be able to gain more than a two pounds of muscle per month and pushing your calories higher than what you’d need for that target will likely bring some body fat along for the ride. But if you need hard numbers: 1.6 grams per kilogram of bodyweight is perfectly good, and more than 2.2 grams is probably unnecessary. [Read More: How to Choose the Best Protein Powder , According to an R.D.] Are you a stage-ready bodybuilder, or do you just kinda wish you were a stage-ready bodybuilder? Because the recommendations above will work just fine for the vast majority of people and body composition goals, even serious athletes. If you aren’t that lean, it doesn’t make sense to eat like you are. But let’s say you are. If you have a very significant amount of muscle mass you want to preserve while shedding fat ? Yeah, there’s a chance that even more protein might be smart. “There’s not a ton of evidence but there is some research on bodybuilders and muscular people who are already quite lean and are looking to lean out, they actually have a higher protein need in order to maintain that muscle mass,” says St. Pierre. “ It looks like 2.2 grams to 3.3 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. If you’re a man who’s like 15 percent body fat, you don’t need that high end. If you’re under ten percent? Your protein needs are increasing.” He’s right that a lot of this data is anecdotal, but there was a 2014 paper published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition that had a similar conclusion: most but not all bodybuilders will respond best to consuming 2.3-3.1 g/kg of lean body mass per day of protein, 15-30% of calories from fat, and the reminder of calories from carbohydrate.( 4 ) A randomized trial from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition also found that more protein might be better during fat loss: in a big (40 percent) calorie deficit , participants taking 2.4 grams of protein per kilogram of bodyweight retained more muscle and lost more fat than those taking 1.2 grams.( 5 ) Those guys weren’t bodybuilders, but the point is more protein might be more important when cutting. Now remember that these recommendations still start at about a gram per pound of bodyweight — a pretty standard recommendation for anyone, albeit it higher than the 1.6 grams per kilo recommended for maintaining or gaining. But it may behoove you to make sure your intake doesn’t fall below the 1 gram per pound if you’re super duper lean. [If gaining size is your goal, you’ll need calories and you might consider supplements — take a look at our picks for the best mass gainers you can choose from!] If you’ve decided you need 150 grams of protein a day, you might be wondering if it’s better to consume protein every hour or to further space it out throughout the day. This can lead us into a discussion about intermittent fasting and nutrient partitioning that’s a little outside the scope of this article. However a lot of research, like a 2012 paper in Journal of Physiology , suggests that if you want to maximize your muscle protein synthesis — that’s a process that switches on genes responsible for muscle gain — you should aim for a good three grams of the amino acid leucine per serving.( 5 ) You’ll get that in about 30 grams of quality protein. ( Whey protein is super high in leucine, so you probably just need 20 grams of that.) That’s what you appear to need to keep up muscle protein synthesis, but it really bears emphasizing that there’s a lot more to gaining muscle than muscle protein synthesis or even protein intake in general: your calories, macronutrients, micronutrients, sleep, and training all need to reflect your goals as well. Protein timing is a relatively small part of a very complex puzzle. It’s also worth remembering that it’s harder to gain muscle as you age. You already knew that, but this “anabolic resistance” means that protein requirements may increase if you want to keep up muscle protein synthesis. Two studies, published in The Journal of the American College of Nutrition and Nutrition & Metabolism , looked at men with an average age of 71 and found that they required larger servings of protein when compared to younger guys to get the same muscle protein synthesis.( 6 )( 7 ) It was suggested while younger folks can trigger it with 20-ish grams of protein, older guys may want to ensure they’re eating at least 40 grams. And when it comes to overall daily intake? “Between 1.2 and 1.6 grams per pound of bodyweight seems to be sufficient, that’s where the evidence stands right now,” says St. Pierre. “It’s pretty much a good catchall for any age but at 50 and over, 1.6 grams per pound is particularly important because you start losing muscle mass once you hit your thirties. If you exercise and eat the level of protein we’re talking about, it’ll help attenuate that muscle loss.” So the overall daily intake may not change all that much, but it appears that larger meals may be a better idea as you age. [Read More: Best Tasting Protein Powders , Tested and Reviewed by Our Team] Don’t get too lost in the weeds. As St. Pierre notes, the fitness industry likes to use words like “avoid” and “must” when talking about protein intake and while some find it motivating, it can easily become demoralizing when you miss your goal. “In reality, it’s about hitting those goals 80 percent of the time,” he says. “If you want to get on stage it’s a different story. If your livelihood depends on it, it’s a different story. But for most people it’s about not making perfection the enemy of progress.” If you actually are a full time athlete then hitting your macros to the milligram may be worth the stress, and even then it’s a maybe. For everyone else, it really isn’t. Eat well, but don’t lose your head. 1. Rodriguez NR, et al.

    "text": "Here’s a fact nobody ever likes to hear: All your hard work in the gym is meaningless if you don’t have proper pre- and post-workout nutrition . The nutrients you provide your body will determine how long and hard you can train in the gym, how well it recovers from a grueling training program , how strong you can become , and how good you’ll look at a given time. Just as you wouldn’t put low-quality gasoline in a luxury car, you need to make sure the fuel (aka food) you’re putting in your body can help it perform at optimal levels. What you eat before and after your workouts can be the difference between reaching your goals and coming up short on stage or the lifting platform. In this article, we’ll discuss the importance of pre- and post-workout nutrition and give you some suggestions — with the help of a registered dietitian — on what you should eat before and after lifting some heavy iron. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. None of these supplements are meant to treat or cure any disease. If you feel you may be deficient in a particular nutrient or nutrients, please seek out a medical professional. There’s no magic formula for pre- or post-workout macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fats) . What works for one person won’t work for another, and your eating plan will vary based on your height and weight, your individual goals, and your eating habits. Before we get into general numbers, we have to talk about one group of people — those who eat nothing before a workout. People prefer to work out on an empty stomach for multiple reasons, either because they’re trying out intermittent fasting or they don’t like working out on a full stomach. Despite what some people might try to tell you, there’s absolutely nothing wrong with this. [Related: The Best Types of Supplements For Performance, Weight Loss, and Health] Sylvia North, MS, RD, a New Zealand-based dietitian, even suggests it for some of her clients. “If an athlete can train fasted, this can be a good strategy for enhancing fat adaptation and metabolic flexibility,” she says. “If it’s not a competition or game day and if the session is less than 90 minutes in duration, I often advise athletes to ‘train low,’ meaning show up either fasted or after a low carb meal. By having stable blood glucose and lower insulin coming into a session, you’re more likely to burn fat.” That said, don’t think that fasted training will provide you with magical results either. One study showed no difference in body composition between runners who trained fasted and those who had a meal before running . Another found that fasted training doesn’t result in more fat burned and that athletes should avoid high-intensity sessions on an empty stomach. ( 1 ) ( 2 ) The few studies conducted on fasted weightlifting say much of the same, with one stating that lifters should focus more on daily caloric intake and sleep than what they eat before the gym. ( 3 ) We can discuss some of the suggested macronutrients for pre- and post-workout meals with that out of the way. We say suggested because, again, it’s going to come down to a variety of factors that you and your nutritionist should sort out. Most importantly, it’s going to depend on how intense your workouts will be and what you’re training for. An ultra-distance runner, for example, might scarf down a Nutella-laden bagel, whereas a bodybuilder may want to reach for a small bowl of rice and steak . Here’s a general guide: medium protein, high carb, and low fat is probably the best way to go. You want anywhere from one to four grams of carbs per kilogram of body weight, 20-30 grams of protein per meal, with the rest of your calories coming from high-quality fats . ( 4 ) You can also use our macro calculator to find a solid starting point. Again, this is just a starting point, and you may need to adjust your numbers based on which way the scale tips and how quickly. Again, the rules aren’t that rigid, but a few rules of thumb can help you achieve your goals. Protein after a workout is a must, but you don’t have to chug a protein shake immediately after your last set (more on that in a minute). Why protein? Remember that during a workout you’re stressing the muscles and creating microscopic tears in the muscle tissue. Protein is the building block of all muscle, so it needs plenty of this vital macronutrient to rebuild your muscle tissue after intense physical labor. Equally as important are carbs — yes, the macronutrient mainstream society and Instagram influencers everywhere have demonized is actually vital toward your physical fitness. Carbs help replenish glycogen, which provides energy for your muscles. Multiple studies have found that ingesting carbs and protein after a workout is better for glycogen replenishment. ( 5 ) “Post-workout is the best time to replenish with carbs and provide protein for recovery,” North adds. “Carbs included here help provide a good surge of insulin to promote growth and deliver carbohydrates to be stored as glycogen in the muscle. If you’re picking one meal to go high carbs in, this is it.” Keep in mind that you should always seek out high-quality carbohydrates and protein, as studies have shown the quality of a macronutrient is vastly superior to how much of it you eat. In other words, a chicken breast with whole wheat toast will always be preferable to deli meat on white bread because the former is packed with more nutrients. ( 6 ) [Related: How Much Protein Do You Actually Need Per Day?] If it doesn’t affect your performance, there’s likely no problem. Yet personal trainers and nutritionists will sometimes advise against eating much of this macronutrient before a workout. Fats digest slower than simple carbohydrates and protein, thereby stopping spikes in blood sugar — an effect that some people want from their pre- and post-workout meals. It takes the body about six hours to convert fat into energy, whereas it takes about half that time for it to tap into carbs for fuel. [Related: How to Gain Muscle — A guide to Eating For Mass] As we discussed in the last section, high-quality macros are the key to success. Yet, we know most people in Western society are eating sub-par fats like chips and hydrogenated oils. If you’re eating good fats like avocados and olive oil, you’ll be on a better track. ( 7 ) That said, you need fats for more than energy. Fats help facilitate hormonal functions, such as testosterone — a necessary hormone for muscle building and…other activities. A quick note on fats: Fats are more calorically dense than carbs. There are nine calories in a gram of fat than four calories in a gram of carbs or protein. So choosing quality fats is important, and this macro is vital for your health. However, indulging in fats too often will usually leave you hungry and a few hundred calories down. When planning out your meals, you’ll normally ingest ample fats residually from meats. A tablespoon of olive oil, while healthy, will also cost you 140 calories and do nothing to fill you up/ Here are some suggestions that North likes to enjoy herself. The level of hydration and electrolytes you’ll need will once again come down to your body and the intensity of your workouts. And it’s not just water — electrolytes are a key part of staying hydrated, too. To start, you should never enter a workout thirsty or dehydrated. Traci Thompson, MS, director of PEAK at University of Utah Health’s Wellness & Integrative Health, says this can lead to a host of problems down the line. “Dehydration impairs your body’s ability to regulate heat, which causes your body temperature and heart rate to rise. This causes you to feel more tired during exercise,” she says on the university’s website . Dehydration can also impact your motor control, decision making, and concentration, Thompson says — all things you need when lifting heavy weight. People often assume you can become dehydrated just by sweating, but it can also be caused by urination or excessive mouth breathing (the vapor on your tongue evaporates).  [Related: What Are Workout Splits and Which Is the Best One?] So how much should you drink? Here’s a good trick to find out: weigh yourself before and after a training session (in kilograms) and subtract those two numbers. Then add how much fluid (water or sports drink) you consumed during your training session, and you get your sweat-loss volume. (Tip: one liter of water is one kilogram, so half a liter is .5 kilograms) So if your initial weight is 90 kilograms and your post-training weight is 89 kilograms, and you drink half a liter of water, your sweat-loss volume is 1.5 kilograms. Make sense? This number is important because you should strive to ensure your sweat-loss volume is less than two percent of body mass. So that 1.5-kilogram number is acceptable for the 90-kilogram athlete. And it’s not just the water you lose you have to keep an eye on either. Overhydration is a genuine threat to athletes that can lead to conditions like nausea, headaches, and confusion. These symptoms are caused by water-electrolyte imbalances or when there’s too much water in your system and not enough electrolytes. ( 8 ) Electrolytes are simply minerals with a small electrical charge (don’t worry, you’re not going to get electrocuted). These electrical charges help the body regulate your heartbeat, muscle contractions, fluid regulation, and more. They also help maintain the balance of fluids in and out of your cells — you don’t want to have too little or too much fluid in them. Electrolytes only work when they’re dissolved in water. Some of the most common electrolytes are: Some research has found that an hour of sweaty activity can produce seven grams of lost sodium; the FDA’s recommended daily intake is 2.3 grams. Those recommendations are made for the average, sedentary person, so make sure you consume enough sodium to support your athletic goals. ( 9 ) A lack of proper electrolytes can lead to increased heart rates and physical discomfort, and in extreme cases, can lead to heart attacks and even death. Talk with your nutritionist or general physician to ensure you’re getting all the necessary electrolytes. Generally speaking, vitamins and minerals will only improve your workouts if you’re low in those nutrients. Vitamin B12, for example, is important for energy production, but taking a bunch of pre-workout B12 won’t give you extra energy. A possible exception here is antioxidants like Vitamin C or Vitamin E. [Related: Fat Loss For Athletes — The Right Way to Approach Calories and Hormones] Exercise seems to cause an increase in free radicals, and there’s some limited evidence that consuming antioxidants around a workout could reduce the cell damage that occurs during exercise. ( 10 ) It certainly won’t make or break your workout, but it’s always a good idea to have a source of Vitamin C with a meal anyway, particularly since it makes it easier to absorb iron. The pre-workout supplement world is way too enormous and complicated to tackle in this piece alone. We strongly recommend you take a look at our list of the best pre-workout supplements to get a handle on which compounds might be most useful for you, but here are a few that have the most research behind them. Caffeine : This stimulant promotes wakefulness and alertness and has strong links to better reaction time, working memory, power output, and endurance. One hundred milligrams is the amount you’ll find in a small cup of coffee; some pre-workouts contain up to 350 milligrams. Choose what works best for your body. ( 11 ) Related: How Coffee Naturally Boosts Your Workout Performance Beta-alanine : Research published in Amino Acids , the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research , and elsewhere have concluded that 1.6 to five grams may increase endurance and help with strength training sets in the eight- to 15-rep range. ( 12 ) Related: The Best Beta-Alanine Supplements For Sprinters, Lifters, and More Citrulline : Several studies, like one published in the European Journal of Sports Science, has found that about 5 to 8 grams of this amino acid may improve blood flow and circulation, which could potentially help with endurance and power output. ( 13 ) Related: The Best Nitric Oxide Supplements For Citrulline, Arginine, and More Creatine : An amino acid that’s really strongly linked to power output and muscle size , a great way to improve performance, but it doesn’t need to be taken before or after a workout — get five to 10 grams per day. Beware, though. Many foods have naturally occurring creatine, so limit your intake via a supplement to about three to five grams. ( 14 ) Related: The Best Creatine Supplements For Bulking, Focus, and More Consuming the right amount of calories , macronutrients, and micronutrients is vastly more important than when you eat. Your gains (probably) won’t go out the window if you don’t eat within an hour or two of your workout. Recent studies have shown that the so-called “anabolic window” is only effective for dedicated bodybuilding athletes, so unless you’re dedicating your life to the sport, this doesn’t apply to you. ( 15 ) Instead, pay attention to distribute your protein intake throughout the day evenly. Studies have shown this strategy has led to increased protein synthesis and improved body composition . ( 16 ) “We don’t necessarily need to hammer in the food immediately as there is a natural delay in gastric emptying post-training,” says North. “As far as my understanding, the ‘60-minute window’ for consuming protein post-workout has been debunked. Eating nutritious food across the day is important for muscle recovery, and it’s not necessarily going to be negated if you have to wait over an hour to eat your next meal. Immediately after training, it’s best to prioritize hydration then get on to eating within approximately 90 minutes.” Many sports nutritionists will tell you that when you eat is not as relevant as what you eat and how much of it you eat — but in the grand scheme of things, timing won’t necessarily be the difference between achieving or missing your goals. Consume enough protein, carbs, and micronutrients, and results will follow both during and after your workouts. And be sure you’re getting ample sleep (at least seven to nine hours per night). Again, your overall caloric intake and daily patterns are much more important than the time you sit down with a fork and knife. Consider seeing a dietitian or a nutritionist so that you know what numbers you need to be hitting.

    "text": "When you’re trying to build muscle, it’s no secret that you need to eat enough protein to go along with your lifting. Ghost Whey Protein is a popular option in the supplements world for chasing those gains. As a nutrition coach, I often help my clients up their protein intake, so I like Ghost’s high protein content and unique flavors. Does Ghost live up to the hype when compared to the other best whey protein powders ? Overall, we think this unique blend can be effective (and tasty), but we don’t love its lengthy list of additives. At BarBend , we know the importance of sports nutrition for fitness goals, and we put every product through our supplement testing methodology to deliver honest ratings, having tested over 110 protein powders. Here’s what we’ve found — let’s dig into our Ghost Whey Protein review. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. This protein powder comes in unique flavors like ice cream, toaster pastry, cereal milk, and more. Each rounded-single-scoop serving sports 25 grams of protein and 130 calories. From the brand Ghost Lifestyle, Ghost Whey Protein contains 25 to 26 grams of a whey protein blend per scoop, making it a contender for one of the best protein powders for muscle gain . The whey protein blend consists of whey protein isolate, whey protein concentrate, and hydrolyzed whey protein. Whey protein is a high-quality, bioavailable, complete protein source, meaning it contains all the amino acids your body needs post-workout, and they can be rapidly absorbed. ( 1 ) Not everyone’s stomach can take whey, which comes from milk and contains lactose. Ghost Whey Protein contains digestive enzymes (protease, bromelain, and lactase). Our bodies naturally produce digestive enzymes, which are responsible for absorbing nutrients from food. People with certain medical conditions or sensitivities may not make them on their own, so adding them in supplement form may help. ( 2 ) Each scoop of Ghost Whey Protein contains 120 to 150 calories, 1 to 3 grams of fat, and 2 to 8 grams of carbohydrates (depending on your flavor choice). These low numbers are ideal for keto diets and potential weight loss, but you may want more if you’re looking to bulk up overall. Ghost Whey Protein comes in 11 unique flavors that collaborate with brands like Chips Ahoy and include real cookie pieces. An upside for those with a sweet tooth but a potential drawback for others — our expert tester and some customers find it too sweet. It also contains high fructose corn syrup, the artificial sweetener sucralose, and a long ingredient list with other additives. The price per serving ranges from $1.61 to $1.75, which may be a bit steep, but you do get more grams of protein than some comparable brands. Ghost Whey Protein is not third-party tested. Have you tried BarBend ’s protein intake calculator ? If you’re aiming for muscle gain or even weight loss, you may well find you have a high goal, and reaching for Ghost Whey Protein can help you reach it. Of course, there’s more to protein powder than how much protein it has (surprisingly) — here’s who should or should not try it. A protein shake is a quick and easy way to kickstart muscle recovery after a workout. Ghost Whey Protein gets a lot of hype and engagement from customers and influencers. They call themselves a “sports nutrition lifestyle brand.” But what is it actually like to add this supp to your stack? Our expert tester, a certified personal trainer, provides ratings for us on taste and solubility using a scale of 1 (boo) to 5 (hooray). I’ll weigh in with my take on ingredients and formulation, price, and safety. There are a few types of whey protein, and Ghost Whey Protein uses a blend. They also indicate the percentage of each type — it is 90% whey protein isolate, 80% whey protein concentrate, and 10% hydrolyzed whey protein. Each type offers different benefits — whey isolate has the most protein, whey concentrate has more nutrients since it is the least processed, and hydrolyzed whey has the quickest absorption. The whey isolate and concentrate have been sunflower lecithinated, which can improve mixability without adding any soy. Ghost Whey Protein also includes digestive enzymes meant to help even more with absorption. Aside from the protein and digestive enzymes, it has a slightly longer ingredient list with additives and thickeners, high fructose corn syrup, and the artificial sweetener sucralose. Some folks prefer to avoid those ingredients. I’m knocking the score down to a 3.5 out of 5 since the protein and digestive enzymes are still excellent if you’re okay with the sweeteners — but you might prefer to avoid all the extras. With 11 unique flavors to choose from, could Ghost Whey Protein be one of the best-tasting protein powders ? Our expert tester, a CPT, says maybe not — but it can still be great for people with a strongly nostalgic sweet tooth. They explain: “I chose the Milk Chocolate , and thought it was pretty sweet for a protein shake — though most of their flavors sounded like they would be too sweet for me. They recommend 5 to 6 ounces of liquid, but I added even more to try to reduce the sweetness. It didn’t taste terrible, though.” They rate the taste a 3.75 out of 5. Mixability matters to on-the-go athletes. We need to know if it’s a blender-only deal or if we can pop it in a shaker bottle with just water. Our expert tester says, “This powder blended pretty well. With just the 5 to 6 ounces of water they recommend, it was pretty thick. But I added a little more water and it didn’t feel watered down at all. The scoop has a convenient home right under the lid too.” They score it a perfect 5 out of 5 for mixability. One tub of Ghost Whey Protein costs $44.99 for 26, 27, or 28 servings. The price per serving is $1.73, $1.66, or $1.61. They also offer a subscription for $33.74 per tub, making each serving $1.30, $1.25, or $1.20. Sure, it’s pricey, but the subscription cost is a great option if you know you like it. Ghost Lifestyle also offers samples for $2.49 per serving, which is a nice feature and somewhat unique among protein supplements. I’m rating the price a 4 out of 5. Since the FDA does not regulate dietary supplements, like protein powder , we look for third-party testing to ensure the safety and transparency of the nutrition label and ingredient list. Ghost Lifestyle does not do third-party testing, and there is no information on their website about manufacturing, so it’s a 0 out of 5 from me. Narrowing down your protein powder from all the options is a complex task. To help you decide, consider some high-level properties. First, how much protein does it have? If you count your macros, how many grams of fat and carbs? You’ll also want to consider micronutrient content, other ingredients and sweeteners, affordability, and safety. Let’s put Ghost Whey Protein to the test — how does it compare when we put it alongside some other favorite brands? We chose Transparent Labs, Xwerks, and 1st Phorm because they have similar protein content and favorable reviews. The most significant difference is the type of whey — while Ghost Whey Protein offers a whey blend, the other three are purely whey protein isolate. Of course, Ghost includes the digestive enzymes that may help digestion, but cutting straight to whey isolate may help more. Ghost Whey is also the least expensive, with the other three hovering around $2 per serving. It has the second-highest protein content, with Transparent Labs taking the lead at 28 grams per serving. Ghost and 1st Phorm Protein use artificial sweeteners, while the others use the natural sweetener Stevia. Here’s what it’s like to be a customer of Ghost Whey Protein and how other customers rate the product. Ghost Whey Protein seems to be a solid protein supplement. It has a high protein content and comes in flavors that partner with the dessert brands of your childhood. For those who prefer something less dessert-like without artificial sweeteners, this won’t be the one for you. Folks sensitive to lactose may also prefer a whey isolate, although the digestive enzymes may help. Not every supplement will work for every person, but if you like a sweeter taste and aren’t sensitive to lactose, this could be a fun product to try, and you can always start with a sample. As with any of the best protein powders , it helps to be able to try it out before committing fully. Yes, Ghost Whey Protein can be a great asset for muscle gain since each serving contains 25 to 26 grams of high-quality whey protein that can be rapidly absorbed after training. You still need to consume enough protein and calories throughout the day (while training consistently) to stimulate muscle growth, but this is a great and convenient addition. Ghost Whey Protein is not third-party tested. The price per serving of Ghost Whey Protein ranges from $1.61 to $1.73. If you go with a subscription, each serving ranges from $1.20 to $1.30.

The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor or nutritionist before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Join BarBend tester Jake Herod, NASM-CNC, and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, as they unpack some of our favorite protein powders from Legion, Xwerks, Momentous, and more. With 8 different flavors and 28 grams of whey protein from hormone-free, grass-fed cows, Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate is an excellent way to hit your protein macros. What makes a great protein powder? Well, the answer is subjective, but we think clean and effective ingredients should do the trick. This pick combines grass-fed whey protein isolate with a blend of digestive enzymes, so you can enjoy each scoop with minimal digestive unrest. Transparent Labs has a lean formula with only 120 to 150 calories per serving, including 1 to 3 grams of carbs, 2.5 grams of fat, and 28 grams of protein. Considering this is among the highest protein per serving (other whey supplements usually have 20 grams to 25 grams), the formulation ranked pretty well. “While the formulation varies slightly between flavors, the core formula remains the same,” says our expert reviewer, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “Based on the amount of whey protein, Himalayan rock salt, stevia , and natural flavors, Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate scores a 4.5 out of 5 for its formulation.” “This is, without question, one of the best protein powders I’ve had in recent memory,” says our tester, a certified personal trainer. “You get the satiety you want from a mixed shake, there aren’t any negative side effects post-consumption, and the flavors are impeccable. I’d recommend this powder to anyone looking to switch up their supplement regimen. It’s a clear staple in my routine now.” This whey isolate also has no artificial sweeteners, whereas most others often include ingredients like sucralose. Plus, it’s made with milk from grass-fed cows and includes digestive enzymes to help limit stomach discomfort. “ I didn’t experience any bloating or stomach rumbles, which was a pleasant surprise as I’ve had other proteins that caused serious GI distress,” says our tester. After mixing the powder with water in a shaker bottle, we noticed zero clumping, floaties, or settling. This is a big priority, especially for those who don’t want to spend time taking out and cleaning their blender. So, we gave this product a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “ Although the FDA does not regulate manufacture of supplements, they do have the authority to ensure supplements are not adulterated or mislabeled. The third party testing that Transparent Labs products undergo provides confidence in the ingredients and lack of contaminants in their products ,” says Dr. Karen Shackelford, M.D. Also, we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Transparent Labs landed in the top 25% overall, earning a B. See our results below. Unfortunately, though, this protein is a little pricey, compared to other options on the market. One serving can cost as high as $2, whereas most others are around $1.50 per serving (or less). So, we had to give this product a 3.5 out of 5 in the price per serving category. If you’re looking for a more wallet-friendly option, we’d recommend supps from Nutricost or Jacked Factory. Good for: Athletes wanting a clean, third-party tested protein powder available in a variety of tasty flavors. Read our full Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate Review . An all natural, non-GMO, fat-free whey that's cheaper than many competitors, Legion Whey Isolate Protein Powder is made from 100 percent grass-fed whey protein isolate from sustainable dairy farms in Ireland. It's also higher in calcium compared to other powders on the market. One protein powder isn’t necessarily better for one gender than another. However, considering people who menstruate tend to need some extra iron, finding a supplement that offers a little extra is a bonus. Legion Whey+ has about 5 to 6% of your daily iron value in some flavors. That’s one reason why we chose Legion Whey+ as our best protein powder for women . We like this pick from Legion for its no-nonsense formulation. One serving is 120 calories with 22 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbs and no fat. “Legion Whey+ scores a 4.75 out of 5 for its formula,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer. “It’s not the most protein-dense protein powder, but its macro ratios and ingredient sources are impressive.” We also like that Legion uses grass-fed milk, no artificial sweeteners, and even has a little iron, which is great for female athletes. There’s plenty of flavor variety, too. If you’re someone who loves to bake with their protein, there are endless possibilities with these flavor options, like Chocolate Hazelnut and Mint Chocolate. “The Cinnamon Cereal flavor tastes just like Cinnamon Toast Crunch,” our tester, a certified personal trainer, says, giving it a 4.5 out of 5 for flavor. “I wish the taste were a little stronger but I enjoyed it.” We also gave Legion’s protein a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “There were no problems when I mixed this protein with a shaker bottle,” our tester says. We noticed no clumping or settling, which is exactly what you’d want in a protein supplement. Legion is third-party tested, but we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test it alongside more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Legion landed in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. Unfortunately, this product may not be in every athlete’s price range. One 30-serving container costs $59.99, which is about $1.99 per serving. Most comparable protein supplements cost around $1.50, which may better fit some budgets. Browse some options from Nutricost or Bulk Supplements if you’re looking to save a few bucks or buy in bulk. Good for: Individuals wanting a protein-forward powder with minimal carbs and fat along with up to 6% of your daily iron value. Read our full Legion Whey+ Review . Offering 25 grams pf whey protein isolate alongside nearly 7 grams of BCAAs, Sports Research Whey Protein Isolate is a great option for those looking to supplement their diets, build muscle, and enhance workout recovery. Protein is essential for those looking to build lean muscle and increase athletic performance, and this whey protein isolate supports those goals with hefty doses of protein, BCAAs, and micronutrients like vitamin D, calcium, and potassium. Athletes may also like that it’s been third-party tested, with Informed Sport verifying it free from banned substances. Overall, BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois scored its formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “This is a pretty impressive whey protein powder — just take a look at its amino acid profile,” she says. “It contains 25 grams of protein per serving, including 6.9 grams of BCAAs , but minimal carbs and fat. If you’re looking to increase your protein intake without skewing your other macros, this could be a great option.” One downside? “If you’re prone to flavor fatigue, you might get bored with Sports Research Whey Protein Isolate ,” she says, noting that the supp only comes in three basic flavors. That said, BarBend team member Eric Pisko enjoyed the brand’s Creamy Vanilla flavor, scoring it a 5 out of 5. “Definitely got the vanilla flavor right with this protein and it does have a creamier aspect to it, whether it was taken in water or milk. Would rate this as a very good-tasting protein powder,” he says. He also scored its solubility a 5 out of 5 “Mixed great in a shaker cup. Not chunky at all and I found it smooth to drink,” he says. It’s worth noting, though, that this protein contains both tree nuts, a common allergen, and sucralose, an artificial sweetener. If you’re in the market for supps free of artificial sweeteners, we’d recommend products from brands like Ritual or Legion. Good for: Those that want a creamy protein powder that’s third-party tested and free of banned substances. Dig into this easily digesting grass-fed whey isolate that provides 25 grams of protein with each lean 110 calorie scoop. It comes in three tasty flavors at a cost-effective price making it a solid choice for nearly anyone. Let’s be totally honest, there’s no one protein powder that’s better for one gender over another — we all need protein. But considering many male athletes enjoy supplements that support hypertrophy , we think this formula is a great option. And it goes without saying, this pick can work for any athlete who wants a high-protein powder. After close review, BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois scores this formula an overall 4.25 out of 5. This protein is pretty low in calories, with as few as 110 calories per scoop, including up to 27 grams of protein, up to 1.5 grams of fat, and only 1 gram of carbs. So, this is definitely a protein-dominant supplement. We don’t love, however, that Jacked Factory uses sucralose to sweeten their powder, as it can cause digestive issues for some athletes. (If you’re in the market for organic proteins, check out offerings from Legion or Ritual.) Jacked Factory offers a good flavor variety, from Blueberry Muffin to Cinnamon French Toast. “The Fruity Cereal Splash tastes a lot like Froot Loops,” our tester, a certified personal trainer, says, giving the flavor a 4 out of 5. “I enjoyed the flavor, though the aftertaste was a tiny bit odd but it didn’t make me dislike the flavor.” Unfortunately, we had to dock this powder a little for solubility. “This powder mixes really easily but I did see a little separation,” our tester says, giving it a 4 out of 5 for solubility. “It’s nothing too noticeable, though.” “ The supplement is manufactured in Canada at a cGMP certified facility, which implies high quality control standards with purity and potency of ingredients, but the product does not undergo third-party testing ,” notes Dr. Karen Shackelford, M.D. This supplement is among the most price-friendly, earning a 5 out of 5 for price per serving. One 30-serving container costs $39.99, which is only about $1.33. For a grass-fed protein, this is a pretty low price point, considering most other grass-fed proteins are close to $2 per serving. Good for: Budget-minded athletes looking for a flavorful whey protein isolate powder. Read our full Jacked Factory Authentic ISO Review . This clean, transparent protein powder relies on organic, non-GMO yellow peas for its 20-gram protein dosage. Additionally, the subscription-based model helps ensure you’re always stocked up to help you meet your nutritional goals day in and day out. Ritual’s Daily Shake 18+ might be the fanciest vanilla protein in the game, as the brand touts its “ handcrafted ” flavor as coming from a “direct-from-farmer vanilla bean extract sustainably harvested in Madagascar.” But taste isn’t all this vegan-friendly protein offers — BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois scored its formulation a 4.5 out of 5. “Essential Protein Daily Shake is third-party tested and made with traceable ingredients, so you know exactly what you’re putting in your body and where it came from,” she says. This formula is pretty lean compared to other vegan proteins, which tend to be higher in carbs or fats. Ritual’s shake is only 115 calories per serving, including 3 grams of carbs (all of which are fiber), 2 grams of fat, and 20 grams of protein. It is, however, a bit high in sodium, per Bourgeois, with 290 milligrams per serving. We also like that this complete protein is free of sugar and major allergens. Ritual uses no artificial flavors and this supplement is third-party tested, so you can rest assured the formulation is free from banned substances. Ritual’s protein also provides a complete amino acid profile, so you can reap all the benefits you’d get with an animal-based product. But how does its “handcrafted” vanilla taste? “Mixed only with water, this protein has a nice taste, though I did notice a tiny chalky aftertaste,” our tester, a certified personal trainer, says, giving the flavor a 4 out of 5. “I also blended it with berries in a smoothie and it mixed seamlessly. But I can still sip it in a shaker cup with no problem.” If you’re looking for a more traditional vanilla taste, we also like offerings from Onnit and Sports Research. Solubility scored a 5 out of 5. “I was surprised at how much I liked the consistency of this protein,” they say. “The texture is smooth, not thick and it wasn’t too watery either. All I did was shake it in a blender cup.” One downside? The price is pretty high compared to most other protein powders — vegan proteins included. One 15-serving bag costs $44, which is about $2.94 per serving. We also wish the package had more servings, considering most other protein powders have 30 per tub. Good for: Vanilla enthusiasts searching for a plant-based protein powder with traceable ingredients. At 21 grams of plant-based protein per serving, Ora Organic offers a blend of pea and rice protein to help you hit your intake goals. Available in Vanilla Chai, Chocolate, Vanilla, or Unflavored, there's a dessert-esque protein option for a range of palates. Ora Organic’s protein powder promises more than just 23 grams of protein per serving — it’s also packed with more than a dozen organic superfoods that deliver micronutrients like calcium, iron, and potassium. This supp is Certified Vegan and USDA Organic, and contains no artificial flavors, GMOs, erythritol, and soy. It’s also gluten-free. “Ora Organic’s Plant-Based Protein Powder provides 39% of your daily iron needs in one serving. Pretty impressive,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, noting that those following a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle often have an increased risk of iron deficiency. ( 15 ) No matter their dietary preferences, athletes need iron . She also likes that each serving contains just 3 net grams of carbohydrates and no added sugar. “It’s a pretty lean protein powder, great for those who need to boost their protein intake without skewing their other macros,” she says. She is, however, wary of proprietary blends. “The primary ingredient in this protein powder is a proprietary blend of several ingredients,” she notes. “I’m usually cautious with proprietary blends because I like to know exactly how much of each ingredient I’m consuming, or how much is in a product I’m recommending to a patient or client.” Overall, she scored the formulation a 4 out of 5. “The balance of macronutrients is great for those who just need to boost their protein intake without affecting their carb or fat intake,” she says. After trying the Vanilla Chai flavor, our tester scored the taste a 4 out of 5. “It’s good, but it’s more ‘chai-flavored’ than any kind of authentic chai drink,” they say. “You can taste the vanilla and cinnamon, but I prefer a bit more spice.” Solubility, meanwhile, scored a 5 out of 5. “No clumps, which shocked me since it’s a hefty two-scoop serving,” they say. The price is the only thing that would keep them from buying it again. “You only get 20 servings per container, which isn’t much considering the price is well over $2 per serving. I’d like at least 30 servings in a tub.” If a budget option is more your speed, we’d recommend protein powders from Nutricost or Bulk Supplements, both of which offer options to buy in bulk. Good for: Athletes wanting a USDA Organic and Certified Vegan protein powder. With nothing artificial, whey from New Zealand, a good amount of fiber, and little sugar, this mass gainer will satisfy most athletes. It's a clean mass gainer that focuses on simplicity over added bells and whistles. A typical protein powder is around 100 to 150 calories per serving. For those looking to gain some weight, these numbers won’t add much to your daily intake. Transparent Labs’ Mass Gainer, one of the best mass gainers on the market, can certainly help with that. For the purposes of weight gain, this formula nails it. “Transparent Labs Mass Gainer scores a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation,” Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer, says. “It accomplishes exactly what it’s intended to accomplish and the ingredients list is very transparent. However, the sodium and saturated fat content is quite high.” One serving is 730 to 750 calories with 106 to 110 grams of carbs, 51 to 53 grams of protein, and 13 to 14 grams of fat. You get double the protein of most traditional protein powders with some extra carbs and fat to help promote weight gain. However, we think it’s important to note that this isn’t a full meal replacement — you don’t get the vitamins and minerals of a complete meal. If you’re looking for a heartier dose of macros, check out our list of the best meal replacements . Our testers, including certified personal trainers, give the flavor an overall 4 out of 5. “I tried the Chocolate Glaze Donut and it actually tastes like a donut,” they say. You do only get two flavor options with this mass gainer, though, so if you’d like more variety, you may want to check out Huel Black Edition or Rival Nutrition Clean Gainer. Despite the density of the powder, this supplement dissolved really well in water, earning a 5 out of 5 for solubility. “It had a nice texture and I didn’t notice any clumping or chunks in my shaker cup,” says our tester. The price per serving is pretty expensive compared to other protein powders (about $4.67 per serving). However, most other mass gainers are actually around that price range, so comparatively, this one is pretty reasonably priced, earning a 4 out of 5 in that category. However, we do wish the container came with more servings. One tub only has 15 servings — some athletes may not want to re-up their supplements every two weeks or so. Good for: People wanting a high-calorie protein powder to support weight gain protocols. Read our full Transparent Labs Mass Gainer Review . Need a protein powder that’s light on cost yet heavy on flavor? Available in four traditional tastes — Chocolate Peanut Butter, Chocolate, Strawberry Milkshake, and Vanilla — this Nutricost offering is available for less than $1 per serving, which can be ideal for athletes looking to build a well-rounded supplement regimen on a budget. We like Nutricost Whey Concentrate for muscle gain because it delivers 25 grams of protein per serving and includes a 2:1:1 ratio of branched-chain amino acids ( BCAAs ), which research has shown to be the most effective when training. ( 19 ). This is also a pretty lean whey protein concentrate, according to BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, with just 1 to 3 grams of carbs and around 3 grams of fat per serving. Our tester, a certified personal trainer, was also a fan, scoring both this supp’s taste and solubility a 5 out of 5. “I don’t generally love peanut butter , actually,” she says. “But they have the perfect amount of peanut in this product — it doesn’t overpower the chocolate.” She also didn’t note any side effects. “My partner has stomach issues with some proteins, but didn’t have any with this one,” she adds. That may not be the case for everyone, though. “This whey protein contains sucralose, which can be hard to digest for some,” notes Bourgeois. Overall, though, Bourgeois scores Nutricost’s formulation a 3.5 out of 5, with high marks for its macro and essential amino acids . If you prefer your supps to be free of artificial ingredients, we’d recommend offerings from Ritual or Legion. Finally, this protein is about on par with other protein powders in terms of price, but you can save a bit of coin by buying in bulk, which we always like. While a 25-serving container runs around $1.50 per serving, a 69-serving container costs just $0.87 per serving. Good for: Budget-minded athletes wanting a supplement with high protein content per serving. Read our full Nutricost Whey Protein Concentrate Review . Gainful Plant-Based Protein Powder offers up to 24 grams of organic brown rice and pea protein, which delivers a complete amino acid profile. Right now, take 50% off your first order with the code: BF50. No matter your dietary preference, there’s a protein powder that works for all athletes, including those following a plant-based diet. We like Gainful Vegan Protein Powder for its customization options — you can snag a bag with 14 or 28 servings, and experiment with six different flavors via Gainful’s single-serving flavor packets. All told, it’s one of the best vegan protein powders we’ve tested. “I really like that Gainful offers a personalized protein powder formula, and I like that it’s unsweetened and free from artificial ingredients,” says BarBend expert reviewer and registered dietitian nutritionist Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, who scores the formula a 4.5 out of 5. This vegan protein supplement combines organic brown rice and organic pea proteins to deliver 26 grams of protein per serving. BarBend ’s Alex Polish, a certified personal trainer, paired their powder with two of Gainful’s six available flavor packets — Chocolate Peanut Butter and Cafe Mocha — and found both “ delightful ,” scoring the supp a 4.5 out of 5 for both taste and texture. “The mocha flavor doesn’t quite give me the coffee-esque vibe that I want, but it’s still very pleasant. It’s even strong enough to completely mask some pretty grassy greens powder taste when I tossed all of the above into a blender with a banana and some oat milk,” they say. Solubility, meanwhile, scored a 3.5 out of 5. “In the blender, this comes out smooth,” they say. “In a shaker cup, it’s pretty sticky on the sides, but then again it doesn’t take the most shaking in the world to get it into a nice solution.” When buying Gainful supplements, customers fill out a questionnaire that helps the company cater to their needs. Polish appreciated this, but also found that it makes it tougher to “purchase a single pouch instead of locking yourself into a subscription.” Subscribers, though, do get text or email access to a registered dietitian who can provide nutritional advice. That’s a nice perk, but does it justify the cost? A 14-serving bag amounts to $3.21 per serving, making it more than $1 pricier than many other vegan protein powders. “I don’t love the price point, especially because there are so few servings per bag,” says Polish. “But if getting supps that feel customized is your thing, I understand the added allure.” If you’d rather spend less on your protein, options from Nutricost and Jacked Factory cost a fraction of Gainful’s protein, but they do lack the brand’s sense of personalization. Good for: Plant-based athletes wanting a unique approach to tastes with each protein shake. Read our full Gainful Protein Powder Review . Coming in at 20 grams of whey protein isolate per serving, Wellah Protein Your Whey offers Milk Chocolate, Dark Chocolate, Vanilla, and Coconut flavors. Each flavor is sweetened with stevia. Whey certainly isn’t the only protein powder out there, but if you’re looking for a supplement that’s high in protein with few other macros, whey is a solid bet. One serving of Protein Your Whey contains 20 grams of whey protein isolate, 3 grams of carbohydrates, and between 0 and 0.5 grams of fat, an impressive balance that ensures you can reap the benefits of whey protein . “Wellah Protein Your Whey is a lean way to boost your protein intake at or in-between meals,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. Bourgeois also notes that this powder doesn’t contain any “extra fluff,” as each flavor contains roughly five to six ingredients, none of which you should have any trouble pronouncing. Bourgeois does note, however, that some flavors contain added sugars — a no-no for some athletes. If added sugars are something you’d like to avoid, check out protein options from Transparent Labs or Legion. This product also has 220 milligrams of sodium per scoop. “If you’re sweating heavily and need to replenish, this probably isn’t an issue,” says Bourgeois. “However, those trying to monitor or limit their daily sodium intake may feel that this takes up a chunk of their recommended daily intake.” Overall, Bourgeois gives this supp’s formulation a 4 out of 5. “This protein powder hit the mark on its protein per serving, but its sodium and added sugar content may not be for everyone,” she says. Our testers score the solubility a 4 out of 5. “You don’t have to go nuts with your shaker bottle to get this mixed well. It’s nice and foamy on top, which is cool and makes up for some of the thinness and grit you get if it’s in water. But in milk, much better. Either way, it’s definitely best if you drink it right after mixing it up. “ Taste also gets a 4 out of 5. “Put this in milk when you want a taste of cereal milk without the cereal . It gives your milk an added sweetness boost without being too sweet or artificial ,” says our tester. Good for: People wanting a whey protein powder that’s free of artificial ingredients. Huel Black Edition is a completely plant-based meal replacement that's loaded with vitamins and minerals. You can also choose from a wide variety of flavor options. While we recommend getting the majority of your macros (and micros) from whole foods, research suggests that meal replacement supplements can help contribute to weight loss. ( 16 ) According to our expert reviewer, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, Huel Black Edition “does a better job of providing a balance of carbs, fat, and protein” than many meal replacement options on the market, making it one of the best meal replacements for weight loss we’ve tested. Each serving of this vegan-friendly supplement contains 400 calories, 24 grams of carbs, 18 grams of fat, and a whopping 40 grams of protein. It also packs in a “diverse micronutrient profile,” per Bourgeois, with hefty doses of calcium, iron, and vitamins A, C, D, E, and K. The carb count may be low for some, says Bourgeois, and if you’re one of them, we’d recommend one of Huel’s Ready-to-Drink shakes (37 to 41 carbs) or Orgain Organic’s Nutritional Protein Shake (28 to 30 carbs). That said, BarBend ’s Rosie Borchert found herself satiated and energized after servings. “It was totally satiating, and I felt energized and full for a good 3 or 4 hours,” she says. “As a meal replacement, I loved that I was getting balanced macros that could support my workout,” she adds. “Sometimes when I play beach volleyball in the morning, I get up and go to the beach at 6 a.m. So having this shake made sure I was getting fueled up when I didn’t have time to make myself some breakfast.” Borchert also enjoyed the taste, giving it a 5 out of 5. “I was worried this was going to be sweet and kind of gross, but the taste is so subtle and satisfying,” she says. “Outside of being flavored, it reminded me of drinking oatmeal. Really liked it a lot.” Bourgeois notes that each serving “requires two scoops, which may not be ideal for mixing and solubility.” This turned out to be true for Borchert. “This isn’t the most soluble drink,” she says. “When you let it sit for a while, some of the mix will settle onto the bottom.” Solubility scored a 4 out of 5. Good for: Those wanting to support their weight loss journey with a dedicated meal replacement powder. Read our full Huel Black Edition Meal Replacement Review . This whey isolate from Momentous offers 20 grams of protein with only 100 calories per serving. In addition to the protein, there's also 90mg of calcium and 115mg of potassium, as well as an enzyme blend to help aid digestion. A protein smoothie is a great way to start your day, especially before a workout. Momentous Whey Isolate is one of the best protein powders for smoothies we’ve tested, as it can blend seamlessly with your favorite fruits and nut butters. Our testers noticed zero settling and the product dissolved seamlessly — after all, you don’t want your blender jamming up with powder clumps. Momentous has all the must-have flavors, including Chocolate, Vanilla, and Unflavored. So, you can find a flavor that combines well with your usual smoothie ingredients. Personally, I’d recommend mixing the chocolate with nut butter and banana. On the other hand, I love vanilla with berries. Or, if you make a savory-tasting smoothie with veggies, the unflavored option is probably your best bet. After trying the chocolate, our tester, a certified personal trainer, gave the overall taste a 4 out of 5. “The chocolate has a rich flavor and is a lot like cold hot chocolate,” they say. “I’d definitely drink this protein time and time again.” Momentous protein blends well, so you don’t have to worry about it clumping at the bottom of your mixer. “ I mixed a double scoop in water, which is double the dose,” our tester said, giving this protein a 5 out of 5 for solubility . “It still mixed really well even in just a cup.” So, in a blender, you should have zero issues. Also, we worked with an accredited, third-party lab to test more than 150 protein powders for accuracy and purity. Momentous landed in the top 50% overall, earning a C. See our results below. Overall, our team liked this formula. It only has 100 calories per serving, including 3 grams of carbs, 0 grams of fat, and 23.27 grams of protein. We also like the inclusion of digestive enzymes , though we don’t love that it’s added in a blend. “[This protein] scores a 4.25 out of 5 for its formulation, with deductions for its cost per serving and the presence of proprietary blends,” according to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, our expert reviewer. We did have to give Momentous a 1 out of 5 for price per serving, though. One 25-serving bag costs $54.95, which is about $2.20 per serving. While we do like that Momentous uses high-quality protein and is third-party tested, you can find similar products from Nutricost and Jacked Factory at a lower price point. Good for: Athletes that prefer to take their protein supplements in smoothies. Read our full Momentous Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate Review . A surprisingly delicious vegan protein powder that's totally free from artificial ingredients and soy, Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Protein contains a 2:1 ratio of rice to pea protein powder, and 4 grams of fiber. Pea protein has proven to be a solid alternative to whey protein for vegans, with two studies published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition and Sports finding no difference in muscle gains when pitting pea protein vs. whey protein .( 17 )( 18 ) Pea lovers may also dig Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Protein Powder, which achieves a complete protein profile by combining pea protein and brown rice protein. “Transparent Labs Organic Vegan protein powder contains only five to seven ingredients, depending on the flavor, and provides a whopping 24 grams of protein per scoop,” says BarBend expert reviewer Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “Plus, you get 30% of your daily iron needs.” That’s great news for vegans, as research has shown that a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle can put individuals at risk of an iron deficiency. ( 15 ) Also, this supp is Informed Protein Certified, which should provide the peace of mind that what you see on the label is what you get. “There are only two flavors available, so if you’re not a fan of chocolate or vanilla, this may not be the protein powder for you,” adds Bourgeois. We’re sorry to report, too, that our tester found the Vanilla option to be “more artificial” than they like, scoring its taste a 2 out of 5. “I noticed a unique smell when mixing this powder. It’s not as if the powder has gone bad, but it’s somewhat off-putting,” they add. Also, after mixing this powder in a shaker bottle with water, our tester noticed quite a lot of foam. It dissolved pretty well overall, but there was still a bit of texture in the liquid afterward. Solubility scored a 4 out of 5. In terms of side effects, our tester did experience a bit of an upset stomach after. “ For me, this could be a personal reaction to the stevia sweetener or specific flavor,” they say. Nevertheless, those with sensitivities to stevia may want to proceed with caution. Good for: Individuals wanting a high-quality plant-based protein powder. Read our full Transparent Labs Organic Vegan Protein Review . This product is clean and simple with 27 grams of whey protein isolate per serving and under one gram of carb and fat. Overstimulated by the abundance of flavor options when it comes to protein powders? Sometimes, an unflavored profile can be more appealing, especially when looking to hit your daily protein counts through means other than a standard shake. Thanks to its transparent ingredients list, low price point, and non-existent taste, this whey protein isolate from Bulk Supplements is our top pick from the unflavored variety. As I, a certified nutrition coach, have tested this powder before, I can attest to the smooth consistency and absent flavor of this popular protein source. Unlike other “unflavored” powders, this Bulk Supplements offering literally has no taste, making it a great protein addition for smoothies, baked goods, and other recipes where you’d rather taste the whole-food ingredients than a powdery supplement. If you’re seeking unique recipes to eat more protein , this can be an excellent ingredient option. Overall, I rate the flavor (or lack thereof) at 4 out of 5. There aren’t many questions surrounding the makeup of this whey protein isolate, either. As with other Bulk Supplement profiles, the ingredient list is pretty transparent meaning you can easily identify everything contained within the powder. I also rate the label transparency at 5 out of 5 thanks to the inclusion of the powder’s full amino acid profile. This gives you a breakdown of all amino acids contained within the dietary supplement for further explanation of what you’re actually consuming with each serving. Bulk Supplements Whey Protein Isolate is also third-party tested, similar to the brand’s other silhouettes. However, I score this protein option at 3 out of 5 for the category as there’s little information regarding the certifying lab. I feel a more identifiable stamp from more recognized entities like Informed Choice or NSF would be more reassuring. This whey isolate is available in multiple container sizes with prices starting at $1.09 per serving. If you’re in need of a flavorless, budget-friendly protein source, this can definitely fit the bill. Good for: People that prefer an unflavored protein for adding to recipes or smoothies. Read our full Bulk Supplements Whey Protein Isolate Review . For athletes wanting a complete protein solution for post-workout needs, MyProtein Impact Whey Isolate can be just the ticket. A majority of the calories within this formulation are designed to help promote post-workout recovery, and the ingredients contain no added sugars or fat per dosage. The flavor profile of protein powder is what makes each option enticing — do you think you’ll want to down a shake each day if the taste is off-putting? For this round-up, we picked MyProtein’s Impact Whey Isolate as the best tasting protein powder thanks to its roster of enjoyable flavors, third-party testing certifications, and easy-to-mix solubility. Our tester, a certified personal trainer, tried the Cookies & Cream variety and has high praise for the mouthfeel of this particular blend. “The cookie crumble chunks give this shake some texture, and I really like the notes that remind me of a perfect dessert-time treat,” they state in reference to their 4 out of 5 taste rating. “The Cookie Monster would definitely approve of this formulation.” Speaking of formulations, this MyProtein offering carries two third-party certifications from Informed Choice and Informed Protein. As such, we rate Impact Whey Isolate at 5 out of 5 for the category. However, registered dietitian and BarBend expert contributor, Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, notes, “This makeup does contain some artificial additives , which may be a burden to some athletes. Plus, the micronutrient profile of Impact is somewhat lacking — I wouldn’t rely on this powder as a singular source of daily vitamins and minerals.” When it comes to blending this Impact Whey Isolate for a tasty treat, our tester says, “I had no issues with regards to clumping or residue. Naturally, the cookie crumbles wouldn’t dissolve in my shaker bottle, but I’ve had other flavors, too, and can say there’s no worry about grit or thin consistencies.” As far as value is concerned, we appreciate that MyProtein offers this protein powder in multiple container sizes between 0.55 and 11 pounds. However, the price is somewhat high with costs starting at $1.69 per serving. Wallet-minded athletes are able to find different solutions with similar protein counts at a lower cost. Good for: Athletes valuing flavor as a top factor in their protein powder selection. Read our full MyProtein Impact Whey Protein Review . This impressive supplement from Vital Proteins combines milk protein isolate with bovine collagen peptides to create a unique formulation to help you meet your daily protein needs. This powder is available in your standard Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry offerings in addition to Cold Brew Coffee for athletes wanting a more adventurous flavor profile. For athletes wanting to improve bone and skin health through supplementation, collagen can be a potential solution given its noted influence on skin elasticity, hydration levels, and bone density. ( 20 ) Vital Proteins — the brand behind some of the best collagen peptide supplements — also crafts a protein powder containing the helpful amino acid. Vital Performance Protein can be a tasty way to tackle your collagen levels with each enjoyable sip. I’ve taken Vital Performance Protein in the past and do feel the formulation is worthwhile, especially for athletes that traditionally take a collagen supplement with the morning coffee or tea. I like the inclusion of milk protein isolate to give this powder that shake-like feel, and lactose-free makeup of the powder means it can be suitable for those with lactose-based dietary restrictions. However, I rate the formulation at 4 out of 5 as there’s some discrepancy amongst your actual protein per serving. If you add the counts from the milk protein isolate and bovine collagen peptides together, this 28-gram measurement does not equal the listed protein total of 25 grams. The taste of this collagen protein, in my opinion, is pretty standard — what you’d expect from the classic Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry varieties. That said, I do enjoy the Cold Brew Coffee option that can be quickly added to your morning cup for a sweet treat. I’ve also rarely seen a Cold Brew flavor offering when comparing other protein powders in my rotation. I rate the solubility at 3.75 out of 5 for this Vital Proteins offering and strongly recommend mixing this with a milk frother or motorized blender. When I shake this powder in a standard shaker bottle or turn it with a spoon, I’m often left with a gritty texture. Giving your mixing efforts a little more horsepower, though, can help eradicate this unwanted mouthfeel. Good for: Those wanting a third-party approved collagen protein supplement. As a budget-friendly casein option, Nutricost Casein Protein Powder comes in three flavor options with costs starting below $1 per serving. This easy-to-mix powder also creates a smooth, enjoyable consistency when mixed that can be perfect for taking advantage of casein ’s slow-digesting qualities post-workout . “ Casein is a slow-digesting milk protein that can help to prevent muscle breakdown when consumed at bedtime. It can promote satiety throughout the day when consumed as part of a meal or snack,” states BarBend expert contributor and registered dietitian Austin Bou. To reap the benefits of this protein option, we recommend Nutricost’s Casein Protein Powder. This appealing supplement can deliver between 24 and 25 grams of micellar casein per serving (depending on flavor) and the formulation is third-party tested for purity and label accuracy, although there is limited information on the certifying lab. As a certified nutrition coach, I do enjoy Nutricost offerings and have experience with this particular casein powder. The ingredients label is easy to read and decipher, and I do appreciate the third-party testing. That said, though, I rate this powder at 3.5 out of 5 for third-party testing as it’s unclear as to which certifying lab is conducting the tests. Other protein powders carry recognizable stamps from labs like NSF or Informed Choice which makes it easier to identify third-party-approved supplements during purchasing journeys. I also score the packaging at 3.5 out of 5 since your servings per tub is dictated by your flavor of choice. For example, when looking at the 2-pound tubs you can expect 26 servings of Chocolate, 30 servings of Unflavored protein, or 28 servings of Vanilla. This could be detrimental for those that need protein stores for specific timeframes. While the following points may seem to be negative, what places Nutricost’s casein powder amongst the best casein protein is its flavor. Yes, you are limited to just three options, but I score the taste at 4 out of 5 thanks to its smooth, creamy aesthetic and just the right amount of sweetness (for my palate, at least). Good for: Athletes wanting a slow-digesting protein option for post-workout recovery or nighttime muscle support. Reading ingredient labels online can give you a good idea of what to expect from a protein powder. But you can’t really put a product to the test without sipping it yourself. To save you from buying and returning any supplements, we took the testing in our own hands, trying more than 100 different protein supplements. We scored each product on a scale of 1 (woof) to 5 (yeah!) in categories like taste, solubility, and side effects. See some of the other considerations that went into our picks below. Sometimes it can be difficult to eat enough protein throughout the day though, which is where supplements come in. Like other powdered products like the best creatine supplements or pre-workouts, protein powder is intended to be mixed with your liquid of choice and blended into a shake for consumption. The amount of liquid required for a serving can depend on your brand’s specific instructions, so it’s always important to read any listed instructions before trying to concoct a beverage before or after training. A majority of powders come with 20 grams of protein or more per serving, but the main metric to consider when calculating how much protein to take is your daily protein requirement. The recommended daily allowance for protein is roughly 0.8 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. ( 21 ) This daily protein count also includes your intake from whole-food sources throughout the day, so it’s important to look for a protein powder that compliments your dietary habits in an effort to help you achieve your goals. According to Catherine Kruppa, registered dietitian and BarBend expert contributor, “If your goal is muscle gain and recovery, the best time to drink your protein shake is within 30 to 60 minutes after you finish your workout. After a workout your body’s tank is empty, and it needs to be replenished with plenty of carbohydrates and protein.” Since there are so many options on the market, there are a lot of factors to consider before you buy and use even the healthiest protein powder. Different athletes are going to want different products, depending on their fitness goals. Here are a few factors to consider. Ultimately, your fitness goals should influence which protein powder you choose. Are you interested in getting lean or do you want to put on some size? Consider your goals and look for a protein that can assist your efforts. As Dr. Karen Shackelford, M.D., notes, “ Resistance training combined with protein supplementation can promote muscle growth , also known as hypertrophy. These supplements may enhance muscle-building by boosting anabolic hormone production, including growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and testosterone. This leads to increased protein synthesis in muscles. Additionally, whey protein contains leucine , an amino acid that can directly trigger muscle protein synthesis .” If you have a lactose intolerance, you want to consider the type of protein powder you purchase. While it may only be 2 or 3 grams, whey concentrate does contain more lactose than whey isolate protein and may not sit well in your stomach. Those sensitive to lactose may prefer to stick with whey isolates or lactose-free, vegetarian options, such as pea protein , a plant-based source of protein. How much protein you’re getting per serving can be just as important as where the protein is sourced from. On average, you can expect around 25 grams of protein per serving from high-quality supplements with some outliers both below and above this mean metric. You’ll also need to think about your personal nutrition and whether the added macronutrients are warranted in relation to your whole foods diet. Crunch the numbers and look for a protein powder that helps you achieve your daily calorie and macro goals. The vast majority of protein powders contain a dash of soy lecithin because it can help to improve mixability. Concerns over soy raising estrogen levels or lowering testosterone levels have been floating around the strength training world for years, but studies show that most people’s hormone levels are unaffected by soy. ( 22 ) Unfortunately, the FDA doesn’t regulate supplements, like protein powder, in the same way it monitors other foods and drugs (more on that below). If you’re someone who desires peace of mind when it comes to a product’s purity, you’ll want to scour the nutrition labels for evidence of third-party testing. If you’re going to spend your hard-earned money on a product, it’s important that you actually enjoy the taste. Every individual has their subjective flavor preferences, so each person will like or dislike various flavors. While most protein powders probably won’t have too many ingredients (outside of protein), you still want to take a close look at the nutrition label. Try to opt for a product that has as little artificial ingredients as possible. You should also pay attention to the calories, carbohydrates, and included fat in each serving, as these can be influential on your overall nutrition, too. The best protein powder for your training program is one that fits your budget best. From our calculations, the average price of high-quality protein powder hovers near $2 per serving, so this can be a good starting point for your shopping experience. However, some brands do offer multiple container sizes or “Subscribe & Save” services that can be helpful in dropping that price per serving to a more manageable number. Whey protein powders are generally pretty low-calorie, as the majority of the formula contains protein. Typically, you can expect one serving of whey to be somewhere around 110 to 130 calories — a nice, rounded number for putting into your best calorie calculator . However, calorie needs vary from one person to another. So if you’re looking to supplement with whey protein, consider your daily expenditure and consult a medical professional as needed. The protein powders on this list are all derived from either whey or pea sources. But even from there, you can find subcategories of each different protein type. Here are a few differences you can expect: While most protein powder formulations tend to have similar ingredients, they can vary quite a bit from brand to brand. Here’s what to avoid in protein powder: Artificial sweeteners can help create pleasing flavor profiles, but as BarBend expert contributor Aimee Gershberg states, “We do not have conclusive evidence to support any consensus on what these additives do for long term health outcomes such as in regard to the gut microbiome or weight management.” Fillers such as maltodextrin can be used in protein powders to increase the carbohydrate content. These highly-processed add-ons can potentially trigger allergies and may lead to gut disturbances. It’s always wise to look at the sugar content of your protein powder. Excessive sugar counts, especially with added sugars, can hike up your caloric intake and potentially lead to blood sugar spikes. Of course, you should also listen to your body when choosing a proper protein supplement. If you’re sensitive to certain sweeteners like stevia or need to avoid gluten, read through the ingredients list to ensure those compounds are not present in your powder. In general, protein powder is a dietary supplement designed to help athletes improve their daily protein consumption in an easier method than constantly dining on whole-food sources. Protein can be sourced from both animals or plants, and can also include additives such as helpful micronutrients, vitamins, flavoring agents, sugars, and more. How much protein you should consume will depend on factors such as your body mass, training regimen, and current goals. If you go over those recommended numbers though, there is nothing to worry about. In the absence of any underlying condition, there is no evidence that there are any harmful health effects from consuming “too much protein.” However, it is always recommended to consult your physician if you have concerns regarding excessive protein intake. Protein powders have a pretty long shelf life but they can expire after a certain period of time. Before you scoop from an old tub, make sure to double check the expiration date. You can take protein powder every day, but determining whether you should is dependent on your overall fitness goals and other dietary habits. If you’re already consuming enough of the macronutrient through whole-food meals, then there is no need to consume protein powder on a regular basis. If you find that you’re failing to meet your daily protein requirements through whole foods, alone, then feel free to supplement your nutrition with a high-quality protein powder. Identifying the “best” protein type for muscle gain can be subjective, but we often recommend complete protein sources, or those featuring a full amino acid profile, for those embarking on muscle-building journeys. Complete proteins are often animal-based, but some plant-based proteins with multiple protein sources can be worthwhile, as well. In the end, the main goal is to find a protein powder that supports your daily protein goals as you eat and train your way to greater muscularity.
