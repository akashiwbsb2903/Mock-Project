If I was to have a very large meal with 70+ grams of protein from a source thats harder to digest like meat. Would eating fruits with proteases enzymes like pineapple, kiwi, and muscadine grapes help utilize and absorb more of the protein during the digestion process?"

Now my question is whether it is safe to eat a can of tuna everyday? Or two? It would be great to hit my protein in 10 minutes worth of tuna cans"

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!"

It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it."

So im asking if its the protein already in your system (day before), or the protein that's starting digestion (day of), or the protein while sore and in recovery (day after), that has the largest effect on muscle growth? \n\nAgain, im asking solely to understand how protein actually affects muscle growth, not looking to only eat protein once every 3 days or looking for diet advice, thanks!"

But then a bag of Goya dried red lentils is 160 calories, 11g protein, 5g fiber. Lower fiber and 1g of protein per every ~14 calories. \n\nNot just lentils either. I have Iberia red kidney beans, which are 70 calories, 9g protein, 14g fiber per serving (1g protein per 8 calories). Goya's label for the same beans says 140 calories, 9g protein, 6g fiber (1g protein per 16 calories). Way less protein and fiber than Iberia. \n\nAnd this is across so many other brands too, different for every brand, different for canned vs. dried. What's the deal??\n\nI'd like to point out that I know the serving sizes vary across each product, but that doesn't explain why the calorie to protein and calorie to fiber ratio is so different."

The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking?

I don’t NEED to do keto since I’m generally pretty healthy, but I do like the benefits. As well as the creative meals, like pork grind and cream cheese/shredded cheese crust pizza.  \n\nMy question is - is it harmful to eat Keto meals while also consuming regular meals every now and then?

    "combined_text": "Title: New[ish] to Supplements; Trying to offset the horrible lack of libido/pleasure caused by Adderall+Zoloft+Buspirone by creating a stack. Questions about my new buylist.\n\nPost: **For TLDR: Skip to 'What I PLAN on buying tomorrow, and Why(input/help requested!)'**  \n\nHeyo, so to make a long story short - I started taking Adderall to treat my ADHD back in September of last year, and ever since combining Adderall with Zoloft+Buspirone, my private 'hobby' has kind of taken a nose-dive in terms of enjoyability, pleasure, and even practicality, leading me to this:\n\n# What I take at the moment:\n\n* Maca Root, 3 grams a day, split into 2 doses; one in the morning before breakfast, and one at night before bed.\n* L-Arginine, 4 grams a day, split into 2 doses, also one in the morning and at night.\n* Selenium, 200mcg taken at night\n* Omega 3s\n* B12(apparently good for people on Adderall, and also good for Type 1 diabetics, of which I am one of)\n* Magnesium(since Adderall depletes magnesium levels; I take it at night, not sure of the dosage atm)\n\n# The problems I am seeking to fix with this stack:\n\n1. Frequently, I will lose interest mid-'session'(because now, it has become a session since it is such a process...), and my guy goes down... And then, when I do have it going and I'm into it...\n2. It takes forever to finish. Like, my god - I will sit there and pound at this thing for literally an hour straight until I finally can finish, and by then I am more just trying to get to the end, which of course makes the end ultimately suck.\n3. General lack of interest in the activity itself, women, men(I'm bi), etc\n\n# What it has done for me so far:\n\nSo, in order to try and help fix the above issues, I started reading up on some things other people on Adderall have done, and I learned about Maca root and L-Arginine; how Adderall is a vasoconstrictor, and how L-Arginine can promote Nitric Oxide production and increase vasodilation through that, so starting back a few months ago I began taking both of them.  \n\nThe first month was pretty awesome not gonna lie. I don't know if it was the Maca or the L-Arginine, but hol\\~y crap, it wasn't just working better - it actually *felt* better. That's what really opened my eyes to the world of supplements.   \n\nI started reading up more on the two, and found out they were apart of some meme-stack called the '[god-tier c\\*m](https://archive.org/download/1551656613734-0/1551656613734-0.png)' (It's just L-Arginine+Lechitin+Zinc+Selenium), which, yeah- it makes sense;  \n\n(Also note - I saw a big bottle of Selenium in Walmart after seeing that pic a while ago and bought it... yeah that stuff definitely increases the volume that uh... your fellahs produce. I can personally attest to that.)  \n\nNow that I've brought up Walmart that leads me to this:  \n\n# What I PLAN on buying tomorrow, and Why(input/help requested!)\n\nUp until now, I've been buying my Maca and L-Arginine both from Walmart, in the Spring Valley brand(which apparently sucks from what I've read on here.) - I'm going to be buying them online tomorrow for the first time, and I have gone ahead and picked out some extra ones to add onto it, since I'm not really getting as good results with the stack now as I was back when I began.\n\nFrom what I have read, it's because Maca has a tolerance that builds up, and also L-Arginine has low bioavailability, and L-Citrulline is better(QUESTION: Should I combine them?)\n\nSo here is the list of all the stuff I wanna buy next month(including some of the other ones I've seen talked about. **NOTE: All of them are by Nutricost! Please advise me on if this is a good idea or not:**\n\n1. Nutricost Sunflower Lecithin (1 Pound) \\~ $19.95\n2. Nutricost Maca Root Capsules (Lepidium meyenii) 750mg, 180 Capsules \\~ $15.95 (**Question:** Should I get this from 'The Maca Team' ? I read some people talking about how their Maca kinda made them feel all wired and jittery and strange, and it kind of has  turned me off of them. I very much want a good source for my Maca though.)\n3. Nutricost Zinc Citrate (50 mg) 120 Capsules \\~ $11.50(I read that apparently, you can deplete your zinc levels by doing the deed too much, and I noticed my multivamin didn't have any in it, and my diet didn't really have much either, so I went ahead and added it)\n4. Nutricost Selenium 200mcg, Vegetarian Capsules \\~ $13.95\n5. Nutricost L-Citrulline 500mg, 120 Capsules \\~ $12.95(**Question**: How many at a time do you need?)  \n\nThank you!  \n\nSorry about the long post."

By taking these, I don't need to take glutathione directly, which is not well-absorbed.\n\nAdditionally, I am taking astaxanthin, which is known for its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can help protect the skin from UV damage and improve its elasticity. Glycine is also a component of collagen, which is crucial for skin health. These two should get all my bases covered when it comes to skin health.\n\nFinally, I included Omega-3 to round out my regimen and provide general health benefits, such as supporting heart and brain function. All four of these supplements have a decent amount of clinical research to back their benefits, so I feel confident in my choices. I considered other supplements, but because you can get most of what you need by eating leafy greens, I decided that it just didn't make sense to add more. What do you think?"

In contrast the calcium carbonate powder I have from Nutricost is super fine and powdery in the jar and dissolves without problem in water. Maybe it is not possible to get magnesium oxide fine powder because it is hygroscopic. I will also try pressing before I put in water.\n\nEDIT: I Tried pressing the magnesium flat with a butter knife on a hard surface to press out the clumps before pouring it in the water.

You don’t need protein shakes, but if you do want them, here’s what finally worked for me. \n\nDisclaimer: There are many causes of gut irritation, so take this with caution. I’m only focusing on gut irritation caused by shakes (big hit of protein in one go).\n\n\n🔍 Background\n\nI’ve tried so many vegan proteins (rice, pea, soy, blends) and always farted as a result. I don't have issues in with my diet normally so it makes sense the shakes were the problem.The same method could be applied to any protein source or dietary change.\n\n\n✅ Method Summary\n\nKeep FODMAP foods low (if practical) during adaptation.\n\nSlowly (4–6 weeks) increase protein shake doses so your body/gut can adapt.\n\nTake a supplement containing protease + alpha-galactosidase. This is the magic stuff! It breaks down protein and GOS carbs so reduces gas during the adaptation phase.\n\nYou won’t become dependent on it. It just helps your gut adjust. You can taper off later.\n\n\n\n📅 Protein & Supplement Ramp-Up Plan\n\n(Reference to capsule means the enzyme supplement and scoops means the number of shake scoops)\n\nWeek 1\n\n½ scoop daily\t1 capsule\t\nKeep diet simple, track symptoms.\n\nWeek 2\t\n\n¾ scoop daily\t1 capsule (test 1 day without midweek)\tIf symptoms flare, stick with enzyme.\n\nWeek 3\t\n\n1 scoop daily\t1 capsule first few days, then taper\n\tTry skipping enzyme every other day.\n\nWeek 4\t\n\n1 scoop daily (steady)\tOnly if symptoms\t\nGoal = tolerate shake enzyme-free.\n\nWeek 5\n\n1 scoop + ½ scoop second shake\t\nEnzyme with 2nd shake if needed\t\nStart gently adding 2nd shake.\n\nWeek 6\t\n\n2 × 1 scoop shakes daily\tEnzyme only if symptoms\tGoal = 2 shakes/day, enzyme-free.\n\n\n\n💡 Final Thoughts\n\nBe kind to your gut. Give it time to adjust. Patience > quick fixes.\n\nMy wife is grateful I figured it out.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf the digestion works too well, you'll need more fibre!\n\nI use rice protein as it's the lowest fodmap"

Returned to sports eventually by starting to lift weights, got really strong and fit again and absolutely loved it, was deadlifting 2x my bodyweight etc and had just started competing in small events. I ran occasionally (pain free) as I had recovered fully, but not as the main focus. Unfortunately I got injured again - I fell while doing box jumps a year ago and got a sacroiliac joint compression injury and very strangely (to me at least), running is one of the few things I can do entirely pain free and is approved by my physio. \n\nWhile I’m doing physio & I can definitely still lift weights, I have to lift way lighter and it’s hard not to compare what I lift now with what I could do before. The same thing happened to me with my ankle injury when I had to quit running and I ended up losing motivation for a while. I want to be consistent with working out for my health at least though - and I’m thinking of switching back to running mainly with a bit of lifting to maintain some strength - have any of you had to make drastic changes to your sport of choice like this? How do you handle it mentally/ rewire yourself to love the new sport and enjoy movement again post injury? Also curious if anyone has tips to not lose too much muscle mass/ strength train appropriately for a runner because I know strength training is still going to be on the books (it helps a lot with my hyper mobility so I definitely don’t plan to stop it entirely). \n\nI got really depressed when I had to quit running for the first time because I was really involved in the sport, and ended up quitting all sports for a while. I’m determined not to let that happen this time - I’ve already had a mopey few months that have made me put on some extra weight again, and I’ve decided it’s time to get back on it. I’m okay with shifting focus, maybe just until I recover, maybe long term, but I know that with the way my brain works, I need a core sport to focus my training around, and since running is what works best right now, it might just have to be that.  \n\nI know there’s a chance I’ll recover fully over the course of a few years the way I did with my ankle injury and maybe be able to switch back to lifting, but for now I want to figure out what I’ll be best at in my current state. I’d love to know about other people’s experiences with similar switches - just to motivate myself, be inspired, and get advice. \n\nAnd if you’re a runner - how do you structure your workouts, strength training to running ratio, etc? I’d love to know!"
