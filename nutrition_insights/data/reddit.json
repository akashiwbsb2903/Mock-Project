(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!"

Or there will be a point where you won't be able to build muscle without increasing protein?\n\nLike what would happen in the scenarios if i took less protein instead of 1.6g:\n\n\\- 1.5g\n\n\\- 1.4g\n\n\\- 1.3g\n\n\\- 1.2g\n\n\\- 1.1g\n\n\\- 1g"

Rye flour contains high levels of phytase that will be activated during the soaking process. ... Even without the rye flour, overnight soaking of oats and other low-phytase grains greatly improves digestibility but won’t eliminate too much phytic acid. ... You can keep whole rye grains and grind a small amount in a mini grinder for adding to these grains during the soaking process.\" (https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vegetarianism-and-plant-foods/living-with-phytic-acid)\n\nIs it safe to consume raw cracked rye if it's been soaked for, say, 12-15 hours. I can't find any reliable answers online, so I thought I'd ask here..."

Two people can eat exactly the same foods yet have completely different outcomes in terms of energy, digestion, or body composition.\n\nI started working with JM Nutrition, a group of registered nutritionists here in Canada, to understand why, in my case, certain meal plans didn't produce the same results I saw in others. It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it."

However questions arise on:\n\n1. How beneficial is this in improving SPI protein quality for muscle synthesis. The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking? Is all \"amino spiking\" bad? Should the company revise their labels, marketing and change the protein content advertised? \n\nI am more inclined to say it's okay but perhaps people from the nutrition field can describe it better or have specific opinions.\n\nThis is not a post seeking professional medical advice."

The idea was to try to figure out which foods gave people the most sustained feeling of satiety per calorie, and their study included 38 common foods. I find the recommendations personally useful but, since the original list is pretty limited, it’s surprising that it doesn’t seem like their methodology for finding satiety indices has ever been extended to more foods nor have I seen replications. This seems like a really useful tool for weight loss, and the methodology makes it sound pretty simple to perform. It also had some counter-intuitive results like boiled potatoes being by far most satiating foods despite a lot of modern diet advice focusing on protein and fiber for fullness, which I think would be worth exploring further.\n\nIs there a reason nothing else was done with the satiety index concept or are there other more recent papers I’m missing?"

But almost no one talks about herbs—despite the fact that some of them have real benefits backed by research.\n\nAs an athlete, I’ve been experimenting with teas made from herbs like peppermint, tulsi, ginger, rooibos, etc. While they aren’t perfect, I’ve noticed legit improvements. Most notably sleep and mental clarity. \n\nDo you think herbs should be part of an athlete’s nutrition stack—or could it just be placebo? Curious what this community thinks."

This means that even if protein intake is not perfectly distributed across meals, for instance, a smaller amount in the morning and a much larger, protein-rich dinner, the body can still effectively utilise that protein for muscle building, provided the daily total is met. Don’t think you need to front-load 50% of your protein requirement immediately after your workout.\n\n# Optimal Daily Protein Intake for Muscle Building\n\nFor most individuals aiming to build muscle through resistance training, the recommended total daily protein intake is approximately **1.6 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight**, which translates to about **0.7 grams per pound of body weight**. Some recommendations suggest going up to 2 grams per kilogram, or roughly 1 gram per pound, but these don’t factor in lean muscle mass, so are likely higher than necessary. A meta-analysis of existing literature concluded that as long as total daily protein intake was at or above this range, **the specific timing of protein consumption relative to a workout did not significantly impact muscle gain**.\n\n# The \"Anabolic Window\" is Very Flexible\n\nThe traditional notion of a narrow \"anabolic window,\" which suggested consuming protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, largely originated from studies where subjects trained in a completely fasted state. However, this concept has limited relevance for most people who consume meals before their workouts. When a mixed meal is eaten pre-exercise, its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects can last anywhere from three to six hours, meaning that **nutrients are often still circulating in the bloodstream during and even after a training session**.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis found that if the total daily protein intake is sufficient, the **exact timing of protein relative to the training session makes no meaningful difference** for muscle gain. Furthermore, the actual physiological \"anabolic window\" for muscle protein synthesis is much broader than just a few hours; it **peaks approximately 24 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for as long as 48 to 72 hours**. This indicates that the body has an extended period to utilise available nutrients for muscle repair and growth.\n\n# Meal Timing and Protein Portion Sizes\n\nResearch demonstrates considerable flexibility in when and how much protein one consumes per meal. A study showed **no significant advantage** between consuming protein immediately before exercise versus immediately after. Building on this, another trial specifically examined what happens when individuals neglect all nutrients for three hours both before and after a resistance training bout, while still optimising total daily protein. The results showed **no significant or meaningful difference in muscle size and strength gains** compared to a group that consumed protein immediately around their workout. This means there is **tremendous flexibility** in fitting protein intake into a busy schedule. While studies suggest that doses of around **30 to 50 grams per meal (or 0.4 to 0.6 grams per kilogram of body weight / 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound of body weight)** appear to maximize muscle protein synthesis *per meal*, the body is also perfectly capable of effectively utilizing much larger protein amounts, such as **75 to 100 grams, from a single meal** for muscle protein synthesis. This is particularly helpful for individuals who find it more practical to consume a significant portion of their daily protein in one or two larger meals, such as dinner.\n\n# Nutrient Availability Trumps Ingestion Time\n\nThe crucial element for muscle protein synthesis is the **presence of nutrients in circulation**, not the precise moment those nutrients are ingested relative to your workout. Nutrients typically **peak in the bloodstream one to two hours after consumption**. Therefore, if you eat protein before a workout, those amino acids will become available in your system during or shortly after your training, ready for use by your muscles. This clarifies why a rush for immediate post-workout protein is often unnecessary, especially if a pre-workout meal has been consumed.\n\n\\---\n\nTaken from r / healthchallenges"

I feel like I’m going a little insane because I am constantly seeing so much conflicting info on what the “right” way to eat is, and I really don’t know what to believe now. \n\nOn the one hand, I’ll see a bunch of people swearing up and down that you should eat steak and eggs for every meal. But then someone else will say that red meat is awful for you and will give you cancer, and say you should ACTUALLY be eating a ton of rice and lentils and beans. But then another person jumps into the convo and is like, “No! Rice is bad because too many carbs! Don’t eat rice!!” And then somebody else pops in like “You need to just eat a bunch of vegetables.” And then another person says “Noooo a lot of vegetables, like potatoes and tomatoes, are actually bad for you.” \n\nSo basically what I am hearing is that every single diet is simultaneously the best thing you can eat and also the worst thing you can eat, just depending on who you ask, because everyone always thinks they’re right. As someone who is trying to eat better and more nutritiously, what should I ACTUALLY be eating? Please help, I cannot stand the misinformation anymore 😭"

If we eat a well-diversified meal with complex carbs, proteins, and healthy fats, we might experience tiredness afterward. \nBut what if we eat a sweet dessert at the end? Would that increase in blood sugar be beneficial? Since the rest of the meal releases energy more slowly (due to the complex carbs), maybe that dessert would help us avoid crashing or feeling sleepy?

While a negligible difference numerically, it's a huge difference percentage wise, so it got me thinking: is the 4 cal/g number really that consistent?\n\nI've always had this game theory in the back of my head, that because different types of carbs break down differently, it stands to reason that carbs from sugar (such as fruit) would have a lower thermal effect than more resistant starches (think potatoes), and thus would be worth more calories per gram. If this were the case, the cal/g of fruit sugar would work out to 7.

This burnt me out last year, because it robbed me of my day of rest. However, I did get some peace with having prepped nutritious dinner. \n\nI need advice from a type B person.

After cooking, I weighed it again and it was only 80 g. A quick search showed that 80 g cooked meat has about 20 g of protein. But usually meat loses only around 25 % of its weight while cooking, so the macros from the raw meat should still apply afterward. So I logged just 20 g of protein today. Did I do this right?

And its a common misconception that you body will be able to pass all of the excess. \n\nAre there are supplements on the market that are tablets and are just pure collagen? Does anyone else see this? Or have I completely misunderstood and you would need and use that extra vitamins C to process the collegen on top of what other vitamin C you might consume? \n\n(I also know that vitamin toxicity is rare but it's nasty and in some cases irriversable)"

This is one definition I have seen of what an \"essential amino acid\" is.\n\n2) Is the definition of an \"essential amino acid\":  \"An amino acid that an animal needs to get from its diet because it's body cannot build it on its own?\"\n\n3) For pure arguement case, not practicality. (I will never feed a cat a vegan diet.) I know cat's are carnivores, BUT are there any amino acids a cat needs that cannot be consumed from non-plant sources if a human wanted to spend the time and energy to feed their cat it. Again, this is for an arguement two non-cat owners are having, its not for practical purposes, just about who is right in an arguement. It is not an arguement about what one should be feeding their cat. More about the definition of what a carnivore is.\n\n3.5) If there are amino acids non-animals cannot produce that an animal needs\n\n\\- A carnivore is an animal that needs to eat meat because it cannot get the amino acids it needs from anywhere else.\n\nIf non-animals can create every amino acid an animal needs\n\n\\- A carniore is an animal that eats significantly more meat based calories than non meat based calories\n\nI think?"

I have read some stuff about how these may have a link to cancer and can upset your gut micro biome, but I don’t how how much of that is legit vs. just click bait. How big of a health concern do these ingredients really pose? \n\nEDIT: Thanks guys. I opted to try the Pioneer Pastures shakes from Target instead. Would recommend those!"

The older tubs used to say something like “2 scoops = 25g protein” and also listed the scoop size as 55cc. So I always just followed that, assuming 2 scoops = one serving (25g protein).\n\nBut recently, I noticed the new tubs don’t mention the scoop size anymore, and the scoop they include now is only 33cc. That’s a pretty big difference.\n\nI’ve been taking 4 scoops of the 33cc one (basically guessing that it’s around the same as the old 2 scoops of 55cc), but now I’m not sure if I’m overshooting or undershooting the amount of protein.\n\nAnyone else notice this change?\nDo we know how many grams of the chocolate Naked Whey actually fit in the new 33cc scoop?\nWould love to hear how others are measuring this now.\n\nThanks!"

Many people said \"eat more during the day to prevent this\". Sure, that is good advice. The point of this post is for when dieters are already in this situation, for any reason (exercised more than usual and did not increase calories enough to compensate, burned dinner, overestimated their calorie intake that day, etc.).

Forgive my lack of science knowledge, but doesn’t Gluconeogenesis have to be happening at those high levels of protein intake — unless you are taking steroids and mobilizing that protein for growth (going anabolic)?\n\nIt’s kind of obvious honestly. People who do ketogenic diets therapeutically (for example epilepsy patients) have to monitor protein intake because high protein will kick them out of ketosis. Why are people recommending intakes higher than the body can actually use?"

From the introductory paragraph:\n\n>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume “1.6-2.2g/kg” [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don’t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you’ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume – it certainly won’t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn’t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.\n\nThis article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition."

    "combined_text": "Title: A rundown of things that basically cured my severe anxiety/OCD/anhedonia\n\nPost: I lived with 24/7 nonstop fight or flight from ptsd and other issues for years, dissociative symptoms and OCD symptoms due to extreme anxiety that would not go away no matter what I did. Ssri and buspirone did absolutely nothing. I also couldn't experience joy or most emotions.\n\nI started researching supplements and after about 6 months of careful trials of different supplements, this is what is working really well for me right now. My mind feels so much better now and my life is genuinely enjoyable again for the first time in like 15 years!\n\n\nSupplements I take every day:\n\n*** NAC ***\n\n-has a long list of health benefits for everyone to take and no known risks to take it long term. For anxiety, it can help balance glutamate levels, and has been studied clinically as a treatment for OCD, anxiety and several other mental health issues. I saw a HUGE improvement after being patient through an adjustment period of maybe 4 days (I took it at bedtime so I could sleep through the adjustment symptoms; not everyone has these symptoms but it basically just made me feel a bit \"icky,\" and Ive read that this can happen because it is basically doing a detox at first). Since then, I feel so much better every day after I take it. I started at 600mg of extended release (Jarrow makes one called NAC Sustain- this extended release makes it gentler than absorbing all of it at once and I take it religiously now), and am increasing it to 1200mg daily (one around 8am and one around 3pm) because 1200 is closer to the recommended therapeutic range for mental health. So far so good!\n\n*** Methylated B-Complex or Methylated Multi with the complete spectrum of Methylated B Vitamins ***\n\n- I'm taking Pure Encapsulations O.N.E and felt AMAZING mood and energy lift with my first dose. A lot of people have issues with methylation and I highly suggest getting a fully Methylated multi to see if you can feel a difference. If your system has methylation issues, it can cause a whole slew of mental and physical health symptoms due to it causing various deficiencies.\n\nI really like O.N.E because it also has *inositol* which is a great supplement for anxiety too, as well as a decent dose of CoQ10 which can also help! It honestly has a whole bunch of useful supplements included. If you look for it on Amazon it might look like the $45 option is the main price, but the 30 pill container is only $23, you just have to click the listing to see that one as an option.\n\n*** PEA (Palmitoylethanolamide) ***\n\nThis one has been a complete game changer for me. When I feel overwhelmed, anxious or stressed (or OCD) I start fixating on all my body aches and discomfort. PEA basically erases all of those aches and feelings of discomfort. It has been studied for things like fibromyalgia, nerve pain, anxiety/ocd/depression, autism related sensory issues, brain fog and neuroinflammation, and I absolutely love it. I dont necessarily \"feel\" anything when I take it (which is good), but i feel very obviously achey and generally uncomfortable when I dont take it. \n\nI'm taking Nootropics Depot PEA, one before bed every night and one around 8 or 9am every morning (I wake up around 6 most mornings).\n\n*** multi-strain probiotic complex *** \n\na lot of mood and mental health stuff can be supported with probiotics since the gut has a \"brain\" in it\n\nI'm taking a brand called OMOGS Women's Probiotic, but it's a cheap brand and I'm going to look for an extremely well rounded brand when I run out of these. \n\nI'm also taking Jarrow S. Boulardii, and until recently was taking Akkermansia. I intend to keep all of these in my daily routine, and it has made a huge difference in my digestion which has helped me feel less uncomfortable and therefore reduced anxiety, but also there are many mental and mood conditions that are caused by bad gut health \n\n*** A good quality L Theanine ***\n\nI'm taking Life Extension Theanine XR Stress Relief, which is an extended release L Theanine. I like it so far. I've also bought mints with L Theanine in them and liked that too. L Theanine is good as a daily supplement or as-needed. The mints seemed to make me a little bit on the drowsy side, but the extended release one is working great as a daily supplement and I love it. \n\n*** Good quality Magnesium Complex (with Magnesium L threonate) ***\n\nSome complexes come with magnesium malate and/or magnesium taurate in it. I change up the brand from time to time but always make sure L Threonate is in it. These are usually 3 pills in a 200mg serving, and I take the 3 pills split up throughout the day to keep from getting drowsy, but I can take 2 at once just fine if I'm not sleep deprived. Days when I miss the magnesium always tend to be more painful, uncomfortable, moody and stressful. If I take it late, I can feel a huge difference when it kicks in!! \n\nIve tried 3 brands so far (from Amazon):\n\nMagTech (with taurate, and my favorite brand so far)\nMagEnhance (with taurate)\nAmandean Magnesium Complex (with malate)- currently taking this one and I have been feeling really mentally good lately so it might be better than MagTech but seems more subtle\n\n*** Magnesium Bisglycinate at bed time ***\n\nI take this religiously at bedtime. Sometimes 100mg and sometimes 200mg depending on how much sleep aid I feel I need. It makes me a bit too drowsy during the day but makes a HUGE difference in my sleep quality and I dont feel as relaxed without it at night and wake up a lot more without it. It is the only sleep aid ive ever tried that doesnt make me sleepy the next day or want to sleep through my alarms. \n\nMy go-to brand of bisglycinate is NutraBio\n\n!!Magnesium citrate and oxide can give you sudden, explosive diarrhea so I would avoid those.\n\n*** 1 mg liquid melatonin ***\n\nI dont like how melatonin makes me feel, but if i take .5mg - 1mg of liquid melatonin along with my magnesium at night, they work really well together without feeling too strong. Also, it helps prevent night time reflux!\n\n*** D3/K2 ***\nI had a slight D deficiency, and found out you need to take it with K2 and Magnesium for absorption/balance.\n\nI take 4000iu D3 (with K2) a day. I started out taking Nordic Naturals, which I liked. Recently I'm trying Thorne liquid drops, and I add the drops to a bottle of water every morning and sip it somewhat slowly and feel a noticeable boost from that!\n\nAS NEEDED supplements:\n\n*** GABA (not gabapentin) ***\n\n is an EXCELLENT go-to for extreme anxiety and stress, if you are okay with possibly feeling a little sedated. I would typically wait until like 2 or 3 hours before my work shift ends, when my brain is fried and im already going to be suffering the rest of the shift anyway if I dont take something, and the slight sedation isnt too much to be able to still do my job and it really does help.\n\n*** L Theanine *** \nUseful as-needed for high stress but more subtle than GABA\n\n*** Mushroom Complex ***\n\nI have been taking a Transparent Labs Mushroom Stack combo that has Lion's Mane, Cordycep and Reishi. Before I reduced my SSRI, it was too stimulating for me to take it unless i was really draggy and fatigued. On fatigue days, i use it as a pick me up so i dont have to rely on caffeine\n\n*** Ginseng ***\n\nSame as the mushrooms, it's stimulating so if my anxiety is high i avoid it, but if i need a caffeine type boost i take this and it works pretty well without the caffeine downsides\n\nUseful supplement but I stopped taking it because I am feeling better and dont need it now:\n\n*** Shoden Ashwaganda ***\nAt first i took this as-needed but felt a bit wonky when I would take it. Eventually I started taking it daily (usually in the late afternoon when stress from the day had built up) and after a while it felt really stabilizing to take every day. But I stopped because things like NAC, methylated vitamins and a couple OTC meds had balanced me enough I dont need it anymore \n\nNootropics Depot makes a Shoden Ashwaganda that is affordable and I liked that one.\nMood Mingle also makes one, but it has B vitamins and i didnt want to take non methylated B vitamins.\n\n- also I want to suggest sticking with the Shoden type. Other types might be worth trying (and might even work better for you)! But Shoden was the only one I personally have enough experience with to recommend\n\nOTC meds that helped me enough to mention:\n\n\n*** H1 allergy meds ***\nMy anxiety has turned out to be linked to a histamine imbalance in my body, and if you have any allergies or regular sinus symptoms like sneezing, runny nose etc, I highly recommend trying Claritin and Nasacort to see if it cuts down on your anxiety symptoms. Sounds weird, but histamine overload can cause anxiety! I notice an enormous difference when I take H1 histamine blockers (claritin, allegra - both non-drowsy, zyrtec can be drowsy for some people, but more on that later) and Nasacort.\n\n*** Pepcid (H2 histamine blockers) ***\n\n if by any chance you might have similar anxiety triggers to mine, Pepcid is an H2 histamine blocker that works in the digestive system. If you ever have heartburn, I strongly suggest avoiding things like Tums and switching to Pepcid (test out the strength that seems to make a difference for you). It also really makes a difference in my mood and ability to relax.\n\nPrescriptions that are not typical anxiety meds that have been game changers:\n\n*** Ubrelvy or another gepant ***\n\nThis one was a complete accident discovery. It is a migraine med, if you have headaches just ask your doctor about it. Whenever I take a Ubrelvy, I can be having the worst OCD meltdown ever and Ubrelvy just FIXES it like magic somehow!! I did some digging and found out it also helps glutamate similar to NAC. As far as I know it is not researched for anxiety, but I can say that for me it is a lifeline. I asked for a prescription for Nurtec or Qulipta because Ubrelvy is an as-needed gepant, but those other two are daily meds. \n\n\nEven though it’s not approved for anxiety, it:\n\nReduces neuroinflammation.\nCGRP is tied to stress signaling.\nHelps prevent overstimulation.\nMight improve dopamine availability, especially if CGRP is disrupting reward/motivation circuits\n\n\nSome researchers even argue that CGRP antagonists should be explored for depression or anxiety actually!\n\nTied to the glutamate thing is the histamine issue:\n\n\nWhen histamine is high, it tends to push serotonin up (through indirect pathways).\n\nIf serotonin gets too high, especially in certain brain regions, it can flatten dopamine and increase obsessive thoughts or anxiety. It can cause numb emotions, anhedonia, obsessive spiraling, etc\n\nMost anxiety meds raise serotonin. I was cracked out when I was taking Lexapro because they just kept raising my dose when it didnt work. I got switched to Wellbutrin that only works on dopamine and norepinephrine, and reduced my lexapro, and it magically reduced my anxiety and racing thoughts by at least half. \n\nI also found out I have ADHD (i got medicated for that before I tried all the other stuff) and from my experience, guanfacine is way more effective at reducing overwhelm- induced anxiety than my stimulant (vyvanse). I consider guanfacine a necessity for me too for anxiety. A lot of doctors seem to only give it to kids but id rather give up stimulants than let guanfacine out of my rotation.\n\nThese meds are very useful but without the supplements and OTC meds I mentioned above, id still be a scattered nervous wreck who can barely function, always feels like something is wrong and is miserable every waking hour.\n\nI'm adding this note about Zyrtec:\n\nI accidentally tried Zyrtec one day when I meant to take Claritin. Not everyone has drowsiness from Zyrtec, but I do. But it isnt like benadryl, it's actually kind of like a pleasant mild sedation that takes the edge off. I cant overthink even if I tried with the Zyrtec. I just feel really chilled out, like when youre slightly intoxicated, but it's safe to take every day if needed. I will probably start using this as a go-to for extreme situations when being drowsy is safe and I just need an emergency chill pill. I definitely am going to trial it for my night regimen to see if it helps with sleep and maybe (crossing my fingers) the anti-anxiety effect will be a bit tamer the next day when I wake up but still taking that edge off, because I really like it!!\n\nThings I'm trialing at the moment, tbd if they will stay:\n\n*** Nordic Naturals Memory Support ***\n\nI think i might have gotten the last bottle of this in existence but in case it ever comes back into stock:\n\nI wanted a well rounded omega complex, and this one has your basic EPA and DHA, not as complete as I really wanted. BUT it does also have phosphatidylserine (PS) which i was dying to try it (it's used for anxiety, brain fog and even ADHD treatment), and also has curcumin and Huperzine A. Ive been leery of the Huperzine A causing too much energy but it's going okay as long as I take it like 11am or so. I feel like the first time i took it close to bed, my brain was too alert. Definitely no brain fog!! Lol\n\n*** quercetin phytosome (with luteolin) ***\n\nJust got this one today for neurological support and I'm so excited to try it!!\n\nI also have come and gone with taking a daily amino acid complex, creatine, protein powder isolate and green banana powder which help me feel good but I always forget because I have to mix them as a shake and I unfortunately get lazy lol\n\nFor my histamine sensitivity i take a DAO supplement which also ties into my anxiety \n\nMy boyfriend thinks Im overmedicated because he wont even take tylenol when he has severe pain, but i feel like a functional person for the first time in a decade so....no ragerts :)"

Don't fall for it.\n\nPost: I saw a story online with The Rock looking slim and muscular, he lost 60 pounds of muscle,a and a story came out that it was due to gut issues which are probably true, a lot of people who are healthy and workout are developing inflammatory bowel diseases. One theory is the supplement protein, amino, creatine powers with additives possibly irritating the gut slowly but surely and taken long term causing full blown inflammation. I know this is what MMA figher GSP said, he gut Ulcerative Colitis and was bulking up taking three protein powder shakes creatines, aminos daily. He just did fasting and clean dieting removing all ultra-processed foods, junks, etc.\n\nThe Rock on the other hand if I were to guess is invested in a new Gut health line, that will drop soon. He probably partnered up with the doctor Mark Hyman who supposedly cured him.\n\nIn their interview the Doctor just said he gave a him a concoction of stuff, he doesn't give the exact protocol because he will probably drop the supplement Gut Cure later on. If he really did heal his gut why not just drop the meal plan, and supplements used?\n\nThis why I say be careful of Celebrity endorsements or of them curing themselves naturally, its mostly marketing gimmick to sucker the consumer, usually its geared toward women they tend to buy these fad diets and cures up like candy. My Mom and Aunt would fall sucker to those infomercials in the 90s of slimming down pills and stuff.\n\n  \nHere is a snippet:\n\n“That was at the beginning of 2024, and I was just getting ready to launch into what would become a nine-month workload for me — nonstop work,” Johnson said. “And I was thinking, ‘Holy s–t, how am I going to get through this with my gut issues? I’m not digesting properly.’”\n\nLuckily, Hyman was able to provide Johnson some relief, finding the issue began after he took multiple rounds of antibiotics, which messed with the bacteria in his gut. He was missing Akkermansia, which coats the lining of the intestine and protects from inflammation and a leaky gut, Hyman said.\n\n“We basically rehabbed your gut. Gave you probiotics and plant compounds—pomegranate, green tea, cranberry — to help rebuild it,” Hyman said. “And we made you this amazing gut health shake with 10-plus ingredients personalized for you.”\n\n[https://nypost.com/2025/06/12/sports/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-reveals-frustrating-gut-health-issue/](https://nypost.com/2025/06/12/sports/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-reveals-frustrating-gut-health-issue/)"

I've also been sober and focusing really intensely on my career without a break so the edge was rather sharp so to speak. I know this dosage isn't recommended. And 6 months into this habit, I found myself unable to cry in acting class (I could cry on my own no problem) and compulsively eating but nothing ever felt like 'enough'. Feedback in my acting classes was 'where is your drive' and I found I couldn't muster it or even be bothered to. Peaceful apathy is what I'd call it. Not useful in these situations.  \n  \nI eat a fresh wholefoods diet minus protein bars (5 star health ratings only) and have a very very active lifestyle. I intermittently fast whenever my schedule is available for it- which means 2-3 times a week. But once I started eating, it was like I couldn't stop! It wasn't until I was 6kg over my optimal, feeling clogged and sluggish that I realised I just simply wasn't getting a kick or satisfaction out of food- like my reward system had completely been dampened. It was actually a scary feeling- the food compulsions, because it felt like I had no control, and I've always prided myself in discipline. I know 6kg doesn't sound like much but I essentially when from a size 6 to 10 ladies- I'll admit a lot of it is muscle but it's not lean and I hate how heavy my body feels when it has too much muscle on it- I'm a dancer so fluidity and lightness is important. \n\nI'm now over 2 weeks off ashwa and my tears in acting class are returning! But so is the blushing and anxiety... which I'm not so stoked about. But I'm finding that any overeating feels less compulsive and more habitual at this point which is super exciting. So keen to shed off these extra kilos and feel like myself again, I'm glad this all coincided with 'bulking season'. Definitely learnt my lesson on dosage! Please learn from my experience <3"

Specifically it causes mild asthma which I don't need an inhaler for unless I'm sick with something else. However, I live with it daily. A little cough here, a deep breath to feel it 'catch' there. Stress is also a factor for me.\n\nI'm fit, eat well, and still have problems. My dad has had similar problems his whole life, and is also fit. Immunotherapy for common allergens has helped, but I'm still just always inflamed. It's like my immune system is bored all the time.\n\nRecently I was on a six day taper of methylprednisolone for an unrelated issue, and during the time I was on the steriod I felt like I'd been cured of asthma. It was so easy to breathe, I stopped event thinking about the inflammation in my lungs etc...\n\nObviously I can't take a powerful steroid like that all the time; however, after learning how it works at a high level, I am thinking about adding some supplements to see if it has any positive impact for me.\n\nI wanted to get the opinion on what dosage to start at, what dosage to work up to, supplement brands, and if there's any other recommendations.\n\nCurrently, I take the following supplements daily:\n\n\\- Vitamin D3 (2000 IU). Bloodwork was low before supplementing, and am normal now. I'm inside almost all the time.\n\n\\- Omega-3 fish oil (600mg)\n\n\\- Vitamin B12 (1000 mcg). Bloodwork was low before supplementing, and am normal now. I eat animal protein, and meet my nutritional needs for protein, but the B12 was still low.\n\nI'm considering adding the following:\n\n\\- Curcumin. Maybe start @ 450mg?\n\n\\- Resveratrol. 500mg?\n\n\\- Alpha-lipoic acid. 100mg?\n\n\\- Berberine. 550mg?\n\nI could increase the dose over time, but was thinking about starting small.\n\nI could get the ALA from Costco combined with CoQ10 and Acetyl L-Carnitine, but not ALA on its own. I'm not sure if the brands Costco sells are decent for the supplements listed above, or if I should look elsewhere? I was thinking about adding NAC; however, I read it can have negative interactions with Curcumin.\n\nThanks for any advice."

    "combined_text": "Title: Focus on bone health, Are these a safe approach for supplements ?\n\nPost: Hello all,\n\nI am a male 27 years old. 97 kg, 214 lbs. I have been doing weight lifting for the past 6 years, but more seriously on the last 3. I take care of my protein and diet intake.   \nRecently, I have been trying to do some running and sports that include running. But a few months ago after playing soccer for about 1.5 hours, my shins have been hurting. And after they healed I tried running and I can feel the pain hit in when I try to do fast sprints. \n\nI have been looking into working on my bone density since that maybe the issue. I do take in a multivitamin, omega 3 and a Glucosamine and MSM daily. I did some research and I read that to optimize this, I need Calcium, Magnesium, D3, and K2. \n\nI also need to mention I am **lactose intolerant**, so I intake the minimum amount of dairy so way less natural calcium.\n\nThe multivitamin has the following :  \n300mg calcium, 84mg magnesium, zinc 11mg\n\nI am looking to probably buy these 3 supplements :  \n[Kirkland Signature Calcium Plus With Vitamin D3 & Minerals 600 mg | 800 IU, 500 Tablets | Costco](https://www.costco.ca/kirkland-signature-calcium-plus-with-vitamin-d3--minerals-600-mg--800-iu-500-tablets.product.100291275.html)[webber ](https://www.costco.ca/webber-naturals-vitamin-k2d3-120-mcg--1000-iu---220-softgels.product.4000062820.html)\n\n1500 (600 mg Elemental Calcium) Calcium, 800 IU D3, 7.5 mg Zinc , 50 mg Magnesium\n\n[naturals Vitamin K2+D3 120 mcg / 1000 IU - 220 softgels | Costco](https://www.costco.ca/webber-naturals-vitamin-k2d3-120-mcg--1000-iu---220-softgels.product.4000062820.html)\n\n120 mcg K2, 1000 IU D3\n\n[webber naturals Magnesium Citrate 150 mg - 300 Capsules | Costco](https://www.costco.ca/webber-naturals-magnesium-citrate-150-mg---300-capsules.product.100107807.html)\n\n150 mg Magnesium\n\n  \nAccording to my research, this is safe and will meet my requirements. Did anyone take a similar approach for extra bone density and health? Is this safe or do you see any risks ?"

With many individuals failing to meet recommended daily intakes, supplementation has become popular. Magnesium bisglycinate, a form chelated (bound) to the amino acid glycine, is marketed as a superior option due to enhanced bioavailability and gentler gastrointestinal effects. However, a deep dive into the scientific literature reveals a more nuanced picture, where its primary advantage may lie more in tolerability than in a dramatic absorption superiority for everyone.\n👇"

Maybe it is not possible to get magnesium oxide fine powder because it is hygroscopic.

    "combined_text": "Title: New[ish] to Supplements; Trying to offset the horrible lack of libido/pleasure caused by Adderall+Zoloft+Buspirone by creating a stack. Questions about my new buylist.\n\nPost: **For TLDR: Skip to 'What I PLAN on buying tomorrow, and Why(input/help requested!)'**  \n\nHeyo, so to make a long story short - I started taking Adderall to treat my ADHD back in September of last year, and ever since combining Adderall with Zoloft+Buspirone, my private 'hobby' has kind of taken a nose-dive in terms of enjoyability, pleasure, and even practicality, leading me to this:\n\n# What I take at the moment:\n\n* Maca Root, 3 grams a day, split into 2 doses; one in the morning before breakfast, and one at night before bed.\n* L-Arginine, 4 grams a day, split into 2 doses, also one in the morning and at night.\n* Selenium, 200mcg taken at night\n* Omega 3s\n* B12(apparently good for people on Adderall, and also good for Type 1 diabetics, of which I am one of)\n* Magnesium(since Adderall depletes magnesium levels; I take it at night, not sure of the dosage atm)\n\n# The problems I am seeking to fix with this stack:\n\n1. Frequently, I will lose interest mid-'session'(because now, it has become a session since it is such a process...), and my guy goes down... And then, when I do have it going and I'm into it...\n2. It takes forever to finish. Like, my god - I will sit there and pound at this thing for literally an hour straight until I finally can finish, and by then I am more just trying to get to the end, which of course makes the end ultimately suck.\n3. General lack of interest in the activity itself, women, men(I'm bi), etc\n\n# What it has done for me so far:\n\nSo, in order to try and help fix the above issues, I started reading up on some things other people on Adderall have done, and I learned about Maca root and L-Arginine; how Adderall is a vasoconstrictor, and how L-Arginine can promote Nitric Oxide production and increase vasodilation through that, so starting back a few months ago I began taking both of them.  \n\nThe first month was pretty awesome not gonna lie. I don't know if it was the Maca or the L-Arginine, but hol\\~y crap, it wasn't just working better - it actually *felt* better. That's what really opened my eyes to the world of supplements.   \n\nI started reading up more on the two, and found out they were apart of some meme-stack called the '[god-tier c\\*m](https://archive.org/download/1551656613734-0/1551656613734-0.png)' (It's just L-Arginine+Lechitin+Zinc+Selenium), which, yeah- it makes sense;  \n\n(Also note - I saw a big bottle of Selenium in Walmart after seeing that pic a while ago and bought it... yeah that stuff definitely increases the volume that uh... your fellahs produce. I can personally attest to that.)  \n\nNow that I've brought up Walmart that leads me to this:  \n\n# What I PLAN on buying tomorrow, and Why(input/help requested!)\n\nUp until now, I've been buying my Maca and L-Arginine both from Walmart, in the Spring Valley brand(which apparently sucks from what I've read on here.) - I'm going to be buying them online tomorrow for the first time, and I have gone ahead and picked out some extra ones to add onto it, since I'm not really getting as good results with the stack now as I was back when I began.\n\nFrom what I have read, it's because Maca has a tolerance that builds up, and also L-Arginine has low bioavailability, and L-Citrulline is better(QUESTION: Should I combine them?)\n\nSo here is the list of all the stuff I wanna buy next month(including some of the other ones I've seen talked about. **NOTE: All of them are by Nutricost! Please advise me on if this is a good idea or not:**\n\n1. Nutricost Sunflower Lecithin (1 Pound) \\~ $19.95\n2. Nutricost Maca Root Capsules (Lepidium meyenii) 750mg, 180 Capsules \\~ $15.95 (**Question:** Should I get this from 'The Maca Team' ? I read some people talking about how their Maca kinda made them feel all wired and jittery and strange, and it kind of has  turned me off of them. I very much want a good source for my Maca though.)\n3. Nutricost Zinc Citrate (50 mg) 120 Capsules \\~ $11.50(I read that apparently, you can deplete your zinc levels by doing the deed too much, and I noticed my multivamin didn't have any in it, and my diet didn't really have much either, so I went ahead and added it)\n4. Nutricost Selenium 200mcg, Vegetarian Capsules \\~ $13.95\n5. Nutricost L-Citrulline 500mg, 120 Capsules \\~ $12.95(**Question**: How many at a time do you need?)  \n\nThank you!  \n\nSorry about the long post."

    "combined_text": "Title: \"Cleanest\" (aka: Least contaminated) Protein Powder for Building Mass?\n\nPost: Good afternoon r/Supplements,\n\nI am a recovering cancer patient (Lymphoma.) All of my scans have been perfect, and I am effectively cancer free according to my doctors. Thank goodness! In spite of that, I am still having a tough time putting weight on like I used to, and I still have other symptoms (like night sweating) which are commonly associated with cancer. Because of all that, I decided that it was finally time to get my ass back in the gym. The way I see it is, if I can actually build some mass and keep it on, then I have little reason to be concerned about my health at this point (considering the good scans and the word of my doctors.)  \n  \n**Part of that process for me has always been consuming whey protein powder.** I was struggling to hit the recommended macros for my weight, even before getting cancer, and that is especially the case now. In the past, I would default to Nutricost's Choc/PB Whey Isolate, which I would drink with milk or blend it into a smoothie after my workout. At the time, I was very satisfied with their product and this routine. Since getting cancer, however, I have become concerned over the fact that a lot of these commercial protein powders contain lead and other heavy metals, as well as BPA, etc... and started looking into possible alternatives to Nutricost. So far, I have had a very hard time finding anything that is up to my standards. I even looked into organic beef protein as a potentially viable alternative to whey protein, only to discover that the most \"organic-seeming\" brand I could find contained 5x the level of arsenic as a can of sardines. I've looked into other types of protein too, and I just keep getting crap.\n\nAs somebody who is just getting over cancer, I am really not trying to poison myself with this sort of thing any longer; I *want* to make healthy lifestyle changes. I've been doing a ton of research over these past two weeks, but I keep coming up short. A lot of places don't display their heavy metals testing-- or, if they do, the tests are rarely ever dated. I've personally called around and emailed many of these companies directly, but they won't send me their tests. I am hearing many versions of \"Yeah, we're compliant, I promise... No we won't send you the tests, those are proprietary,\" and I can't tell you how absolutely frustrating this is as a diligent consumer.  \n  \nCan anybody please recommend me a few brands to look into, that meet my criteria? I want an organic, daily-use protein powder that is free of BS. No heavy metals, BPA, and other carcinogenic crap... It does not need to be easy to mix, I just want as few additives as humanly possible."

Have fun :)\n\nPost: # Analysis of \"Menerals\" Dietary Supplement: A Due Diligence Report\n\n\n\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis report provides a multi-faceted assessment of the \"Menerals\" supplement brand, synthesizing available corporate, scientific, and consumer data to inform a comprehensive due diligence review. The investigation was significantly constrained by the profound scarcity of verifiable information. The official website,[https://menerals.com/](https://menerals.com/), is inaccessible, and the brand's digital footprint is remarkably minimal. Corporate records reveal a direct contradiction between the company's legal registration address in West Virginia and its public-facing address on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in Nevada. This corporate opacity, coupled with a lack of market presence and third-party accreditation, represents a major risk for a consumer brand.\n\nGiven the product's likely nature, a detailed scientific analysis of common mineral supplements and fulvic acid was conducted to provide essential context. This analysis reveals that while minerals are essential for human health, there is limited scientific evidence to support the use of supplements for the general population. The likely inclusion of fulvic acid in a \"Menerals\" product presents a notable risk profile, as this ingredient is associated with potential side effects, interactions with various medications, and a significant risk of heavy metal contamination due to imprecise purification. The broader regulatory landscape, as evidenced by enforcement actions from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against other companies, highlights the common industry practices of making unproven health claims and selling adulterated products. In conclusion, the \"Menerals\" brand exhibits multiple characteristics of a high-risk venture, lacking the transparency, credible feedback, and scientific backing that would be expected of a legitimate dietary supplement company.\n\n\n\n# 1. Introduction and Analytical Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n# 1.1. Report Objectives and Scope\n\n\n\nThis report is designed to provide an expert-level analysis of the \"Menerals\" supplement brand by synthesizing all available information. The scope of this analysis is broad, encompassing an examination of the brand's corporate legitimacy, market presence, and consumer sentiment. Furthermore, it includes a critical scientific review of the efficacy and safety of the ingredients commonly found in such products, followed by an overview of the regulatory environment to provide a complete picture for due diligence. The objective is to produce a nuanced, evidence-based assessment that can guide a potential consumer, journalist, or professional investigator.\n\n\n\n# 1.2. Methodological Limitations and Data Contamination\n\n\n\nThe investigation was fundamentally challenged by a profound scarcity of relevant information, necessitating a reliance on contextual and inferential analysis. The single most critical limitation is the inaccessibility of the official website,[https://menerals.com/](https://menerals.com/).Without access to this primary source, it is impossible to verify the product's official marketing claims, a definitive list of its ingredients, dosage recommendations, or any purported scientific evidence the company might offer.  \n\n\n\nThe research material is heavily polluted with irrelevant information, a phenomenon that itself is a key finding. The digital environment is saturated with content related to topics that share similar-sounding names or spellings, requiring rigorous filtering. These irrelevant search results include a wide range of topics:\n\n* Discussions and articles related to video games such as Stellaris and other online communities. \n* Detailed information on surf camps and travel companies in various global locations. \n* Corporate profiles for other, unrelated \"mineral\" companies in the oil and gas or industrial sectors, such as Minerals Technologies Inc. and ES3 Minerals LLC. \n* Generic consumer complaints from platforms like eBay that are not specific to the \"Menerals\" brand and often describe issues with shipping and communication for other products. \n\nThe presence of this significant amount of \"noise\" signals a remarkably low digital profile for the target brand, highlighting a critical absence of an established market presence.\n\n\n\n# 2. Corporate and Market Presence Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.1. Business Registration and Corporate Profile\n\n\n\nA review of corporate records reveals Menerals, LLC is legally registered in the state of West Virginia.The designated office and mailing addresses are listed as 190 Ridgeway Drive, Bridgeport, WV, with Benjamin Davisson identified as the organizer and member. \n\n\n\nHowever, a separate public-facing profile with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) provides a different location, listing \"Menerals, LLC\" in Reno, Nevada.This direct contradiction between the company's legal registration address and its public BBB profile location is a significant point of concern. A legitimate business typically maintains a consistent public presence and corporate identity. The existence of two separate, conflicting addresses creates an immediate barrier to conducting effective due diligence and complicates any potential legal or consumer protection actions. This discrepancy may indicate an unestablished business, a dropshipping model, or an intentional effort to obscure the true nature of its operations, all of which undermine consumer trust and accountability. The BBB profile also indicates that the business is not currently rated because it has been in business for less than six months and does not yet have a sufficient track record.This finding is central to understanding the brand's nascent status and its minimal digital footprint.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.2. Market Footprint and Third-Party Accreditations\n\n\n\nThe brand’s market footprint appears to be in its earliest stages, with no established reputation or third-party accreditations. Menerals, LLC is not a BBB Accredited Business, a status that requires a commitment to upholding the organization's standards for trust. Its unrated status with the BBB is a direct consequence of its recent formation.The absence of an established history contrasts sharply with a well-regarded company like BiOptimizers USA Inc., which holds an A+ BBB rating in a similar category and location, demonstrating a long-standing commitment to consumer trust.The lack of any formal accreditations or certifications is a further red flag, as these are critical benchmarks for consumer confidence in the dietary supplement industry.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.3. Consumer Feedback and Public Sentiment\n\n\n\nThe brand has an extremely limited to non-existent digital footprint in terms of consumer feedback. A comprehensive review of public forums like Reddit reveals no substantive discussions about the \"Menerals\" supplement. Search queries related to the brand name yield results that are overwhelmingly unrelated to dietary supplements, often linking to discussions about gaming or other general topics. The only relevant result is a thread title on the \n\n\n\nr/Supplements subreddit, \"My experience with Menerals,\" but the associated content is noted as being inaccessible. The complete lack of public reviews or a discernible customer base suggests one of two scenarios: either the brand is so new that it has not yet generated a customer base large enough for public discussion, or it is a \"ghost\" brand with no real product fulfillment or customer service. The total absence of feedback is a significant data point, as it is a more compelling sign of a potential lack of legitimacy than a handful of negative reviews.  \n\n\n\n**Table 1: Corporate and Market Profile of Menerals, LLC**\n\n||\n||\n|Attribute|Information from West Virginia Registry|Information from Better Business Bureau|\n|**Legal Name**|Menerals, LLC|Menerals, LLC|\n|**Registration State**|West Virginia  |N/A|\n|**Designated Officer**|Benjamin Davisson  |N/A|\n|**Legal Address**|190 RIDGEWAY DRIVE, BRIDGEPORT, WV  |10437 Double R Blvd. Reno, NV 89521  |\n|**BBB Accreditation**|N/A|NOT BBB Accredited  |\n|**BBB Rating**|N/A|Not Rated (In business less than 6 months)  |\n\n\n\n# 3. Product Claims and Scientific Context\n\n\n\n\n\n# 3.1. The Critical Data Gap: Absence of Official Website Content\n\n\n\nAs noted previously, the inaccessibility of the official website makes it impossible to conduct a direct analysis of the product's specific claims, ingredients, or dosage information. Therefore, the following scientific review is based on an analysis of the principles and common components associated with a product named \"Menerals.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 3.2. Foundational Scientific Principles of Mineral Supplementation\n\n\n\nMinerals are foundational to human health, serving as essential nutrients that support a wide range of physiological functions, from bone development to nerve signaling.They are broadly classified into macrominerals (e.g., calcium, phosphorus, magnesium) and trace minerals (e.g., iron, zinc, selenium).While a balanced diet is generally sufficient to provide these nutrients, the dietary supplement market is built on the premise of filling perceived \"gaps\" in nutrition.  \n\n\n\nHowever, extensive clinical research indicates that the broad use of multivitamin and mineral supplements does not provide overall benefits for the majority of the population.A comprehensive analysis of studies involving over 450,000 people found that multivitamins did not reduce the risk for chronic diseases like heart disease or cancer, nor did they slow cognitive decline or reduce the risk of an early death. In some cases, supplements have even been shown to be deleterious. For example, a trial in Finnish smokers showed that beta-carotene supplements statistically significantly increased lung cancer incidence. This broad scientific consensus among major medical institutions serves as a cautious baseline against which any unproven claims for \"Menerals\" must be measured.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 3.3. In-Depth Ingredient Review: Fulvic Acid and Mineral Complexes\n\n\n\nAssuming \"Menerals\" is a mineral complex, it is highly likely to contain fulvic acid, a common ingredient in such supplements. A review of this compound reveals a high degree of uncertainty regarding its purported benefits and a significant number of documented risks.\n\n* **Fulvic Acid:** Research indicates that fulvic acid, a group of chemicals that form during the breakdown of organic matter, is anecdotally used for a variety of conditions, including hay fever and fatigue. However, there is \"no good scientific evidence to support these uses,\" and any alleged benefits from its anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective properties are largely unproven in human studies. A significant danger associated with fulvic acid is the risk of heavy metal contamination, as the compound is extracted from soil and requires thorough purification to avoid harmful elements like lead and mercury in the final product. This risk is particularly high for products from suppliers who use unreliable extraction methods. From a health perspective, fulvic acid is associated with side effects such as diarrhea, headaches, and a sore throat. It may also worsen autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, by boosting the activity of the immune system. Furthermore, it can interfere with medications that slow blood clotting or suppress the immune system. \n* **Common Mineral Complexes:** Using ZMA (Zinc, Magnesium Aspartate, and Vitamin B6) as a representative example, the research shows that while each component is essential for bodily functions, there is limited research to support the common claims made by manufacturers about enhanced muscle strength, recovery, or sleep quality.A registered dietitian advises that for most people, a balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients, and supplementation should only be considered in the case of a verified deficiency. \n* **Risks of Excessive Doses:** The research explicitly warns that taking high doses of various minerals can be harmful. For instance, taking more than 400 mg of magnesium supplements can cause diarrhea. High doses of copper can lead to stomach pain and, over time, damage the liver and kidneys. The use of manganese supplements at high doses for long periods might cause muscle pain, nerve damage, and other neurological symptoms. The lack of a verified dosage for the \"Menerals\" product, due to the inaccessible website, compounds the health risks for a potential consumer.  \n\n**Table 2: Summary of Scientific Consensus on Mineral Supplementation and Fulvic Acid**\n\n||\n||\n|Ingredient|Role in the Body|Scientifically Supported Benefits|Potential Risks and Side Effects|\n|**Magnesium**|Turns food into energy, supports muscle and nerve function, promotes bone health.  |May ease symptoms of depression and anxiety.  |High doses (more than 400mg) can cause diarrhea.  |\n|**Zinc**|Supports immune system, cell creation, and wound healing.  |May help lower fasting blood sugar in people with diabetes.  |Excessive intake can have negative effects.  |\n|**Fulvic Acid**|Forms during breakdown of plants/animals; often found in humus.  |Anecdotal uses for hay fever and Alzheimer's, but no good scientific evidence to support these claims.  |Can worsen autoimmune diseases, interact with blood thinners, and may be contaminated with heavy metals.Side effects include diarrhea and headaches.  |\n\n\n\n# 4. Regulatory and Compliance Review\n\n\n\n\n\n# 4.1. The U.S. Regulatory Framework for Dietary Supplements\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the dietary supplement industry is primarily regulated by the FDA and FTC.Under federal law, dietary supplements do not require pre-market approval. However, they cannot be promoted for the treatment of a disease, as they are not proven to be safe and effective for such purposes.The FTC focuses on preventing false and misleading advertising, which can include unproven health claims and the use of \"gag clauses\" to suppress negative consumer reviews.The FDA's enforcement is primarily post-market, where it can issue warning letters or take legal action against companies for violations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 4.2. Analysis of Regulatory Actions (Case Studies)\n\n\n\nA review of regulatory enforcement actions against other companies provides valuable context for the risks associated with a brand like \"Menerals.\"\n\n* **Mother Earth Minerals, Inc.:** The FDA issued a warning letter to this company following an inspection and a review of claims made on its website, highlighting the agency's authority to act on a brand’s publicly available information. \n* **Mineral Store, Inc./Elemental Research, Inc.:** This case is particularly relevant. The FDA issued a warning for the product \"Cesium Plus,\" citing significant violations.The company failed to submit a new dietary ingredient notification, a requirement for any new ingredient not previously present in the U.S. food supply before 1994.The FDA also determined the product to be adulterated, stating there was \"no history of use or other evidence of safety\" for cesium chloride. The agency cited reports of serious heart problems in humans and animals associated with the ingredient, concluding that it presented a significant risk of illness or injury.This enforcement action is a textbook example of the types of risks that can arise with a product containing unverified or novel trace elements, which is highly pertinent to a brand named \"Menerals.\"  \n\nThe lack of any public-facing information for \"Menerals\" makes it impossible to verify its compliance with these regulations, but its general lack of transparency and a verifiable business history suggests a high risk of similar violations.\n\n\n\n# 5. Synthesis and Recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n# 5.1. A Multi-Layered Risk Assessment\n\n\n\nBased on the multi-faceted analysis, the \"Menerals\" supplement brand exhibits a high-risk profile across all key areas of due diligence.\n\n* **Corporate Risk (High):** The conflicting addresses on legal and public records, coupled with the brand’s unrated and unaccredited status with the BBB, points to a significant lack of transparency and a nascent, potentially unstable corporate structure.\n* **Market Risk (High):** The complete absence of an official website and the minimal to non-existent consumer feedback make it impossible to conduct basic due diligence on the product, its claims, or its customer support. This non-existent digital footprint is highly unusual and suspicious for a modern consumer product.\n* **Scientific and Health Risk (High):** Based on the product's name, it likely contains mineral complexes and possibly fulvic acid. The scientific consensus on the general efficacy of multivitamins is cautious at best. The known risks associated with fulvic acid—including the potential for heavy metal contamination and adverse reactions in individuals with autoimmune conditions—pose a significant health hazard, especially when product information and safety warnings are unavailable to the consumer.\n\n\n\n# 5.2. Recommendations\n\n\n\n* **Avoid Purchase:** The overwhelming number of red flags—including corporate opacity, a non-existent public profile, and the potential health risks of its likely ingredients—precludes any positive recommendation. It is not possible to verify the product's safety, efficacy, or even its physical existence.\n* **Consult a Medical Professional:** Before taking *any* dietary supplement, it is crucial to consult a doctor or a registered dietitian. The research confirms that for most people, a balanced diet provides all the necessary nutrients, and supplements may be ineffective or even harmful if taken without a medical need. \n* **Prioritize Transparency and Third-Party Verification:** When considering a dietary supplement, look for brands with a clear and consistent corporate identity, positive ratings from organizations like the BBB, and independent certifications from reputable laboratories such as [ConsumerLab.com](http://ConsumerLab.com), NSF International, or U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). These third-party verifications are essential for ensuring a product contains what it claims to and is free of contaminants. \n\n**Table 3: Review of Available \"Feedback\" and Data Contamination**\n\n||\n||\n|Relevant Information|Irrelevant Information (Data Contamination)|\n|\"My experience with Menerals\" Reddit thread title, which is inaccessible.  |Discussions about video games like Stellaris.  |\n|Menerals, LLC profile on the Better Business Bureau.  |Information about industrial companies like Minerals Technologies Inc. and ES3 Minerals LLC.  |\n|The legal business registration for Menerals, LLC.  |Reviews and details about surf camps and travel companies.  |\n||General, unrelated consumer complaints from an eBay seller and a networking forum.  |\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp9q2ok8uklf1.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce56d8bb4d7afa9ea5f6d1e056e39a5d8150d33\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvecssdktklf1.png?width=3568&format=png&auto=webp&s=842a43e0c151186c8ef7e1d7d736e0a0fce164a5"

I actually really like it except it lasts for hours usually and has thrown my sleep way off. I can't seem to identify what's causing it despite playing with when I take any supplement or cutting one out for a day or 2 here or there.\n\nSometimes, when I do get tired, I will pass out and wake up literally only 3 hours later and be unable to get back to sleep. Often I'll pass out later for another 2 - 4 hours but not always, and sometimes I don't feel great on those days. And once or twice I slept like 10 hours on and off.\n\nI try to train 3 - 4 days a week, but lately I'm skipping days on poor sleep days and only getting 2ish because of it. Also worried about such little sleep negatively impacting my gains but honestly I seem to be getting consistently stronger faster.\n\nI think the obvious solution is to cut out some or all supplements and start reintroducing them one at a time but I'd still love to here others people's insights and experiences relating to this."

The general benefits are well-known and seem to work for a lot of people:\n\n* **Improved Sleep Quality:** This is the big one. It can help lower core body temperature and promotes a feeling of calm, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep without morning grogginess.\n* **Calming / Anxiolytic Effects:** It acts as a neurotransmitter, which can help take the edge off anxiety and stress during the day.\n* **Collagen & Connective Tissue Support:** It's a key component of collagen, so it’s great for skin, joint, and bone health.\n* **Glutathione Precursor:** It helps the body produce glutathione, a master antioxidant.\n\n**The Surprising (and Unofficial) Side Effect**\n\nHowever, while digging through forums and anecdotal reports online, I've come across a recurring theme: **a noticeable decrease in libido / sex drive.**\n\nI want to be clear, this is **not** a common side effect listed in major clinical studies, which makes it all the more interesting to discuss from a user-experience. To my knowledge, no study has specifically examined the **relationship** between glycine intake and libido\n\n**Diving into the 'Why': The Plausible Pathways**\n\nBefore just dismissing it,  there are actually a few plausible mechanisms that could explain why this might happen in some individuals:\n\n1. **Glycine as an Inhibitory Neurotransmitter:** This is the most likely explanation. Glycine's main job in the central nervous system is to be a \"brake pedal.\" It calms things down. Sexual arousal and libido, on the other hand, require strong \"gas pedal\" signals from excitatory neurotransmitters (like dopamine). It’s possible that by boosting the body's primary \"brake\" system, Glycine inadvertently dampens the excitatory signals needed for a strong libido in some people.\n2. **The Serotonin Connection:** Some research suggests that Glycine can influence and increase serotonin levels in the brain. As many people know from the side effects of SSRI antidepressants, elevated serotonin is very frequently linked to a decreased sex drive. If Glycine is nudging serotonin levels up, it could potentially be causing a similar, though likely much milder, effect.\n3. **Indirect Hormonal Influence (More Speculative):** Glycine can have some influence on the pituitary gland. Any significant shift in hormones like prolactin could theoretically impact libido, though the evidence for this pathway is much weaker than the first two.\n\n**So, I'm turning to the collective wisdom of this sub:**\n\nI'm curious to see if the anecdotal reports hold any weight in a larger group.\n\n* Has anyone else experienced a noticeable drop in libido while taking glycine?\n* If you did, what was your dosage and when did you take it (e.g., 3g before bed)?\n* Did the effect go away if you stopped or lowered the dose?\n* Conversely, has anyone noticed **no effect** or even a **positive** one on their libido, perhaps due to the benefits of better sleep and lower stress?\n\nGlycine is fantastic for sleep. However, some experienced a potential drop in libido. This could be biologically explained by Glycine's role as a primary \"brake\" (inhibitory) neurotransmitter in the body or its potential to increase serotonin. Wondering if anyone in the community can confirm or deny this from their own experience."

    "combined_text": "Title: Hollow undereyes and temples and collagen degradation after taking a Malaysian supplement laced with corticosteroids (18M)\n\nPost: I’m 18 and I need to ask about something unusual that happened after taking a supplement called Kian Pee Wan which I very recently found out is laced with corticosteroids. I have no idea which corticosteroid exactly. Based on the manufacturer’s other products and what I've read about them it’s most likely dexamethasone.\n\nDuring each period I took this supplement, my temples and under-eyes became hollow noticeably. Before taking it, despite being severely underweight for years, I had a lot of volume just UNDER my eyes and my temples weren’t THAT thin (but my cheeks were, obviously) the back of my jaw didn't look big or anything.\n\nThe hollowing worsened with each round of exposure. Looking back, the changes happened only during the times I took the supplement, I didn’t realize it at the time. This is not normal aging. This time this has become too hard to ignore I cannot keep living in denial and I highly suspect the corticosteroid in the supplement has been somehow hurting. My eyes literally look sunken, my face looks absolutely horrible from below/lower angle. My eyes used to be narrow and wide and now they look rounded as if something is constantly very lightly pulling on the bottom of them and there is this weird ridge on my eyelids from it as if there is excess skin.\n\nIn the Summer of 2024 I did a 1-month course. January 2025, 2 week (ish) course. In last may I did a 3 week course and starting on June 20th I did a roughly 45-day course which is the most recent. now I completely stopped.\n\n\nEven though I gained 20 pounds during the last round NONE of the fat went to my temples. they’re still hollow and look even worse than before\n\nMy arms actually gained subcutaneous fat which is really weird since corticosteroids supposedly cause fat loss in the arms. Yes I did get moon face in the lower half of my face (everything under my cheekbone), my stomach got a little bit bigger, but no fat loss in the arms??\n\n\nI also suspect the corticosteroids severely impacted my collagen and skin health my nasolabial folds are now very pronounced my skin barrier feels destroyed, and skin looks unhealthy overall and aged. Indentations on my forehead appeared that weren’t there before. Also after the first time I tried this supplement, I noticed dehydration lines around my mouth that I had never seen before in my life.\n\n\nI cannot find anybody else that has experienced this issue. Everything on reddit and google talks about moon face, buffalo hump, or peripheral limb fat loss, but nothing like this.\n\nI want to make this clear I did not take prescription corticosteroids deliberately. This was a contaminated supplement. I was laced. I'm not trying to promote anything illegal/dangerous and I don't plan on taking this shit ever again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced hollow temples or under-eyes after corticosteroids? Does anyone know how this might have happened and if this might improve after stopping, losing the gained weight, and waiting long-term? Because that's what I plan on doing. I also plan on taking biosil for my collagen, and a multivitamin since my diet has always been pretty lacking. I would seriously appreciate any insight.\n\nTL;DR: Took a Malaysian supplement (Kian Pee Wan) that was secretly laced with corticosteroids. Instead of just “moon face,” I developed severe hollowing in my temples/under eyes and skin/collagen damage that got worse each round. Stopped now and wondering if anyone else had this and if it can improve long-term"

I like his clips, his advice seems sound. \n\nIn the end, he is selling his products and services. Services are some sort of workout plan, probably includes a nutrition plan. Also, a line of supplements. \n\nThe supplements are suspect, in my opinion. Not because of the contents being not legitimate, but because they are very expensive. Like 70 bucks/ month for one bottle, one month supply. \n\nTwo products are testosterone support. They have several herbs, fernigreek and such. Amino acids. That sort of thing.\n\nThey also contain shilajit, which I know from doing a little reading is generally not legitimate in a capsule form. It needs to be a resin, it's kind of rare and kind of expensive, mixing it up with a bunch of stuff in a capsule is just sort of suspicious. Suspicious for being poor quality, amounts to nothing, a waste of money, is what I mean. \n\nCurious if anyone has any insight or commentary or experience with this individual or his products. I do kind of like the guy, I think he knows his stuff, but I think he might be... I think his profit margins might be massive on these products, which appear to be basic blends of fairly common minerals and herbs and such.. . . that are sold at a fairly exorbitant price."

Take the year or even 2 to fill out your cap and you’re going to go very far.”\n\nMy original plan was to do this show then rebuild for 2 weeks and then cut for 6 weeks to hit the Hurricane Classic on October 16.  But one of the big take away from the pro seminar (10 Olympia level athletes) was to tune out the noise, listen to your coach and judges feedback…\n\nSo we are taking the feedback and going all in on growth.  Gonna get to my cap next season (PEELED)… was 227 at weigh ins… cap is 242 so if we assume I could’ve been 5 lbs leaner I’ve got 20lbs of tissue to build."

Robinson, Jr. photographed by Richard “Dick”Falcon.\nRichard “Dick” Falcon 1909-2005.\nBorn in Italy and raised in Ohio, Falcon emerged as a seminal figure in mid-century American physique photography. His early passion for physical culture led him to bodybuilding, gym ownership, and life modeling at Ohio State University—where his eye for the male form took artistic flight. Working primarily in gelatin silver prints, Falcon’s imagery appeared in vintage physique magazines like Tomorrow’s Man, and his studio served both fitness enthusiasts and a discreet network of collectors. His Columbus-based Falcon Athletic Club became a hub for photographing hundreds of athletes with anatomical precision and subtle emotion.\n\nLetter from Robinson to bodybuilder Stuart Wright:\n“Dear Stu-\n\nWas concerned for your safety so I called your Dad to see if you are okay and not in need up to your big beautiful pecs. Was glad to hear you are high, dry, & handsome. Of course I already knew you were handsome.\n\nEnclosed are some recent pics of a Florida gig. They are by Dick Falcon. Have ordered 13 of them in 8x10. Thought you might enjoy these. Do hope you get by A.M.D. while you are there- I know you’d enjoy yourself and have fun if you do.\n\nAm driving everywhere now. I really enjoy the freedom. Drove to Houston June 3-5. Got the flu- was real ill for 2 weeks. Ok now except for cough. Hope the pants [?] and shirt fit. Write when you can.\n\nP.S. I really appreciated your XMAS visit, you looked great! Sincerely, Bill”"

Self coached so far\n\nCurrently just doing 10-13k steps per day at 2500 cals with ~170g protein and rest from whatever.  \n\nGot a few questions,\n1. Given skin colour, do I need a tan or would the stage glaze that’s given as part of show be enough?\n2. Weight cap is 98.4kg, does that seem feasible given current state/condition to come in competitive? It will be a natural show, no plans on stepping on gear until maybe mid 30s at earliest if ever tbh \n3. When it comes to the final weeks, is there anything that I really need to make sure to think about? Asking experienced competitors. Essentially what tips do you have for peaking as well as possible?\n4. In terms of cardio, would steps be enough to get to where I need to or would there need to be specific focused cardio? Thinking of doing 30mins on stairmaster from like 8 weeks out. \n5. I do have exams to study for. These would be around 6 weeks out, just wondering if anyone has experience with something like this close to a show and any recommendations on how they handled it."

It simply helps make ATP (energy).\n* **🩺 Myth:** Creatine damages kidneys. **✅ Fact:** Safe at 3–5 g/day in healthy people. Concern came from misread case reports.\n* **🧑‍🦲 Myth:** Creatine causes hair loss. **✅ Fact:** One small, unreplicated study. No consistent evidence.\n* **🥵 Myth:** Causes dehydration or cramps. **✅ Fact:** Trials show fewer cramps and injuries in users.\n* **👶 Myth:** Unsafe for kids/teens. **✅ Fact:** Increasing evidence of safety.

Daily 3–5 g works fine (loading just speeds results).\n* **👵 Myth:** No benefit for older adults. **✅ Fact:** With resistance training → stronger muscles, better bone health, function.\n* **🏃 Myth:** Only for lifters. **✅ Fact:** Helps in endurance, recovery, hydration, concussion & neuroprotection.\n* **♀️ Myth:** Less useful for women. **✅ Fact:** Effective across all life stages; may aid mood, bone health, pregnancy.\n* **💊 Myth:** Other forms (HCl, ethyl ester) are better. **✅ Fact:** **Creatine monohydrate = gold standard.** Cheaper, safest, best studied.\n\n# 🎯 Takeaway\n\n* Safe, effective, versatile supplement.\n* Best for **muscle, recovery, brain health, and aging support.**\n* Stick to **Creatine Monohydrate, 3–5 g/day.**"

    "combined_text": "Title: For those with anxiety disorder and overactive bladder (urinary urgency), alkalising the urine with baking soda 200 mg daily may greatly reduce the anxiety\n\nPost: I have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), and on some days, my anxiety flares up much higher than normal. \n\nI theorised that my high anxiety days might be precipitated by irritation of my bladder lining, as I have overactive bladder (aka irritable bladder), and on days when my anxiety is worse, I often have increased urinary urgency. The main symptom of overactive bladder is urinary urgency (having to go to the toilet urgently several times daily).\n\nDoing some research online, I read that acidic urine can irritate the bladder lining. So I then started to experiment with making my urine less acidic, doing this by taking baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) 200 mg daily, away from meals. Baking soda is an alkalising agent, and so counters urine acidity. By alkalising the urine in this way, I hoped my bladder lining would be less irritated, and hoped this would reduce my anxiety.\n\nSure enough, after I started taking baking soda 200 mg daily, I noticed that my high anxiety days completely disappeared! Normally I would have around 2 days a week with much higher anxiety levels than normal. But I have been taking baking soda 200 mg daily for over two months now, with zero high anxiety days. So this trick with baking soda seems to work for me.\n\n\n\nHow does alkalising the urine with baking soda reduce anxiety? What might be the mechanism? Well many mental health conditions — including anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar, ADHD, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia and autism — have been now  linked to inflammation in the body and brain, and some researchers think that this neuroinflammation could be the underlying cause of the mental symptoms, since brain inflammation greatly disrupts brain operations.\n\nThe way the immune system works, if inflammation is detected in the body organs (such as the intestines, stomach, bladder, liver, etc), this information is signalled up to the brain by the vagus nerve, and in response, the brain ramps up its own internal inflammation levels. This increased neuroinflammation in the brain could then precipitate or worsen mental symptoms.\n\nNow overactive bladder is linked to ongoing chronic inflammation of the bladder lining (ref: [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289139/)). So it could be that in people who have overactive bladder, irritation of the bladder lining from acidic urine may worsen bladder inflammation, thus increasing brain inflammation, which in turn could exacerbate mental symptoms such as anxiety.\n\nAround 17% of the population suffer from overactive bladder (ref: [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903463/)), so this condition is not uncommon.\n\n\n\nOf course, I cannot be sure that this is the actual mechanism by which alkalising the urine reduces my anxiety. But for those with overactive bladder as well as generalised anxiety disorder (or panic disorder), it might be worth experimenting with 200 mg or more of baking soda daily, taken away from meals.\n\nFor the purpose of urine alkalisation, drugs.com says baking soda oral dosing is from 325 to 2000 mg, taken 1 to 4 times a day (re: [here](https://www.drugs.com/dosage/sodium-bicarbonate.html#Usual_Adult_Dose_for_Urinary_Alkalinization)). However, if you take higher daily doses of baking soda, eg 1000 mg daily, I find you can become slightly lightheaded, as baking soda will make the blood very slightly more alkaline, and alkaline blood in turn causes constriction of blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to lightheadedness. However, I do not notice any lightheadedness side effects on 200 mg daily.\n\nBaking soda should be taken away from meals, as it reduces stomach acid levels, and this can interfere with digestion.\n\nNote that the pH levels of the blood and body tissues are very tightly controlled, and moderate amounts of baking soda will barely change body pH levels. Blood pH is normally tightly maintained between 7.35–7.45. Baking soda will however substantially increase urine pH to make the urine less acidic.\n\n\n\nPossibly urine alkalisation might also help other psychiatric conditions as well, like depression, OCD, bipolar, ADHD, anorexia nervosa, etc, if people with these conditions also suffer from overactive bladder.\n\nUrine alkalisation is also known to help prevent kidney stones."

I have come across several studies tying some supplements that I love to cancer risks, particularly feeding tumors that you may not know you have or fueling cancer cells. It is especially true of amino acids and NAD boosters. \n\nSome supplements that I like that may be a concern: serovital since it has amino acids, thorne’s resveracel since it has NR, and glutathione. \n\nI have autoimmunity and there are supplements that genuinely help lower inflammation and give me more energy. \n\nThanks for any thoughts on this. \nWhat are the thoughts here on the risks? Is it worth the risk? I keep going back and forth on it."
