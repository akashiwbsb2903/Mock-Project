( 1 ) Created in the body from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine, this sports nutrition supplement helps your body produce more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energetic molecule that powers short, intense muscle contractions like those used in the Olympic lifts. Our product testers evaluated dozens of creatine supplements, including many that are vegan-friendly. In our testing , we looked at: We’ve helped nearly 2 million readers find high-quality supplements, and we’re confident our guide to the best vegan creatine supplements will help you do the same. Medical disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Also our choice for the best creatine supplement overall (vegan or otherwise), Transparent Labs Creatine HMB earns 4.5 out of 5 points for its formula, which includes a clinically backed dose of creatine monohydrate of 5 grams per serving. The powder also contains ß-hydroxy ß-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, which is known to play a role in reducing muscle protein breakdown. ( 2 ) On top of that, Transparent Labs Creatine HMB contains BioPerine black pepper fruit extract. Black pepper is a source of piperine, a compound thought to increase the bioavailability of nutrients — meaning, this creatine supplement could be more readily absorbed by your body than those without piperine. Finally, the inclusion of vitamin D may further enhance muscle protein synthesis. ( 3 )( 4 ) According to registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, it’s a really strong formula backed by clinical research. The one thing that’s missing, Bourgeois notes, is caffeine for those who take creatine pre-workout. “Many people include creatine as part of their workout routine,” she says. “This formula doesn’t contain any caffeine, which might be a bummer if that’s what you’re looking for.” Our product tester, who tried the Peach Mango flavor, liked the taste well enough, though “there’s something weird about it,” she says. “The flavor itself is good and strong enough, but I think the BioPerine, which is a derivative of black pepper, is altering the taste. When you smell it, it smells spicy in a weird way. When mixed, it tastes a bit bitter unless mixed with more than the recommended amount of water.” Still, she gives it 4 out of 5 points for taste. Additionally, all three of our testers who tried this product had issues with solubility, collectively awarding it 3.5 out of 5 points. They each noted that the powder didn’t dissolve fully, resulting in “floaties” that needed to be shaken up again before each swig. Read our full Transparent Labs Creatine HMB Review . Legion Creatine Gummies are the best creatine gummies overall, and they happen to be vegan-friendly, too. These gummies are formulated with the widely researched creatine monohydrate, and they provide the upper end of the optimal dose, which earns them 4 out of 5 points for formulation. Deductions in their score stem from the use of sugar alcohols, which can cause gastrointestinal distress in some individuals. According to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, “There’s definitely more room for research on creatine gummies, but Legion’s version is intriguing.” The clinically-backed dose, the third-party testing, and the flavor variety are all on her “pros list” for this product, she says. However, if you plan to start creatine supplementation with a loading phase , these gummies may be a no-go for you, she says, due to the fact that each serving contains 8 grams of sugar alcohols. “Research has shown that sugar alcohols like erythritol can cause digestive upset,” Bourgeois points out. “Sugar alcohols may cause nausea, bloating, and diarrhea, among other gastrointestinal effects.” Our tester didn’t have any issues with side effects, and mostly enjoyed their experience with the gummies, rating them with 4 out of 5 points for both taste and texture. They’re “more sweet than tangy and not a ton of flavor but easy enough to get down” and while “these do get stuck in your teeth a little and stick together in the jar,” it’s not a dealbreaker for our tester. Though pricey at about $1.50 per serving, Legion Creatine Gummies earn 4 out of 5 points for price because gummies in general are much more expensive than creatine powder. Legion also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if you don’t like them, no questions asked. This unflavored micronized creatine is available in two different size options and is Informed Sport certified, vegan, and gluten-free. You can even subscribe to recurring deliveries and save 15 percent. It doesn’t get simpler than this: This Sports Research supplement contains creatine monohydrate, and that’s it. No more, no less. “Each dose provides the upper end of what research deems the optimal dose of creatine monohydrate,” our tester says, “and there’s no unnecessary fluff to drive up your cost or potentially cause unwanted symptoms.” As such, this supplement earns 5 out of 5 points for its formula. “Sometimes, less is more in the supplement world,” says registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “You get a research-backed dose of creatine monohydrate here. Because it’s a straightforward supplement, there’s no puzzling it into your routine. It can fit easily.” If purity is a concern, you’ll be pleased to know that Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate is manufactured in a cGMP-compliant facility, Non-GMO Project Verified, NSF certified gluten-free, and NSF Informed Sport-certified. This creatine supplement also earns 5 out of 5 points for taste, or the lack thereof. It’s unflavored, and there’s no taste at all, our tester says. The same goes for solubility, which also earns 5 out of 5: “If you didn’t tell me there was creatine in this water I wouldn’t know. It’s truly tasteless and mixes easily,” our tester raves. That said, “If you’re someone who likes a little flavor in their creatine, you’re out of luck,” Bourgeois says. Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate only comes unflavored.” This no-frills creatine powder earns high marks from our expert product tester. “ProHealth hits all the high points,” they say, awarding it a perfect 5-out-of-5 score for the formula. “You get 5 grams of micronized creatine monohydrate per scoop, and each batch is third-party tested for quality, purity, and potency.” Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois likes the simplicity of ProHealth Longevity Creatine. “You don’t have to sacrifice research-backed dosing of creatine for other ingredients,” she says. “It’s also free of 10 major allergens: dairy, egg, soy, wheat, gluten, corn, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts. Not all creatine products are made in allergen-free facilities.” Bourgeois points out that ProHealth uses Creavitalis , which is marketed as a high-quality and easily absorbed creatine monohydrate, as opposed to the current standard used in most products, CreaPure . “We know creatine has a lot to offer, but I’d love to see more research on Creavitalis, specifically.” Bourgeois says. ProHealth Longevity Creatine earns 4 out of 5 points from our tester for taste. “I noticed a slight aftertaste in water, and my wife thought it tasted metallic, but we didn’t notice this when mixed in a sports drink” he says. Our tester gives it 5 out of 5 points for solubility, noting that it’s much more powdery than other creatines he’s tried so it mixes great, but it does settle at the bottom of the glass or bottle eventually. This product is more expensive than average for a plain creatine monohydrate powder at $0.55 per serving, so it earns 3.5 out of 5 points for price. However, the increased cost may be worth it to those who need a product certified to be free from the 10 major allergens. This extremely inexpensive creatine is micronized for extra solubility. We also appreciate Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate for its available flavor profiles, although the use of sucralose as a sweetening agent may lead to GI distress in some athletes. Fitness enthusiasts on a budget will love that Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate powder costs just 20 cents per serving. A tub of 100 servings will run you a little over $20, or less if you choose to subscribe and save. It earns a perfect score of 5 out of 5 points for price. It has a winning formula, too, earning 4.5 out of 5 points. While it contains the upper end of the clinically backed dose of creatine—5 grams per serving—a half-point deduction comes from the inclusion of sucralose in flavored options. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener known to cause digestive upset in some individuals, which is something to be aware of if you have a sensitive stomach. “Nutricost stays true to its name with this one,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, LDN. “Each serving provides a clinically-backed dose of creatine monohydrate at a budget-friendly price. I love that Nutricost doesn’t limit their dosing to keep your cost per serving low.” In addition to its low price, it tastes good, too. Rather, it tastes like nothing, our tester says, which is ideal for an unflavored creatine product. “It’s actually tasteless, even in water,” they say, awarding it 5 out of 5 points. Nutricost creatine doesn’t score quite as high for solubility, earning a score of 3 out of 5 points. It settles in the bottom of the glass if you don’t drink it in one go, our tester notes. Read our full Nutricost Creatine Review . Our team of product testers, which includes certified personal trainers, certified nutrition coaches, and other health and fitness professionals, spent weeks identifying and testing—yes, actually ingesting—dozens of creatine supplements. We evaluated eight criteria for each product we tried, rating each on a scale from 1 to 5: A score of 1-2 is below average; a score of 3 is average for the industry; a score of 4-5 is above average. These products are also great choices for anyone, including those on a vegan diet. Making a case for creatine isn’t hard: There’s a very long list of creatine benefits . Vegan creatine supplements range in price from about 20 cents per serving to nearly $2 per serving. Expect to pay about $20 to $50 per month, depending on the brand. As you shop for creatine , keep these factors in mind. Creatine monohydrate remains the gold standard. For enhanced bioavailability, look for micronized creatine powder. Other forms of protein, like creatine hydrochloride (HCl) and creatine ethyl ester, have not been proven more effective or beneficial. ( 16 ) Look out for fillers. Except for flavors—and in some cases, depending on the type of supplement (i.e., gummies), preservatives—creatine supplements don’t need many ingredients at all. In fact, some of the best creatine supplements contain just one ingredient: creatine. One common con of creatine is bloating, and minimizing artificial sweeteners and additives can help keep digestion smooth. If you plan to use your creatine pre-workout, consider a formula with caffeine to boost energy levels and further enhance exercise performance. If you want to be sure about the quality and purity of your creatine, look for independent analyses of the contents. The best indicator of quality is a certification from the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), but certificates of composition from any lab can tell you if the product contains any contaminants and if it is properly dosed. The cleanest vegan creatine supplements are those that contain only pure creatine monohydrate powder. Examples include Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate and Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate, both of which have a single ingredient: micronized creatine monohydrate. Yes. Vegan creatine is synthesized in a lab, and most creatine supplements on the market are made that way. Look out for gelatin in capsules and gummies if use of animal products is not negotiable for you. Unfortunately, it’s tough for vegans to get enough creatine from diet alone, since the most potent natural sources include red meat, poultry. and fish. Vegetarians can get small amounts through eggs and dairy products. Luckily, most lab-created creatine products are, in fact, plant-based creatine. Since they are synthesized chemically from the amino acids sarcosine and cyanamide, they do not contain animal byproducts. Exceptions include gelatin in capsules and gummies. Yes, of course. People on a vegan diet can build muscle by following a hypertrophic strength training plan, eating in a calorie surplus, and prioritizing protein and amino acid intake. Creatine is not directly involved in muscle-building processes like muscle protein synthesis. ( 17 ) However, it can improve athletic performance and muscle recovery, leading to increases in muscle strength and power.

Björnsson’s day starts with one and a half liters of water mixed with Hydrate, an electrolyte powder , and creatine . His daily nutrition plan consists of five meals, which are organized when he wakes up and coordinated with his workout schedule. Björnsson consumes approximately 400 grams of protein en route to 8,000 daily calories . “I used to eat 10,000 calories daily . When I was younger, I was more active and needed more calories,” Björnsson recalled. “Now, I am old, lazy, and eat only 8,000.” Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Meal one contains approximately 1,640 calories, earning Israetel’s approval as a quintessential bodybuilding meal. When Björnsson feels sluggish during training, removing olive oil or another easily-controllable, high-calorie condiment from his diet can help alleviate the issue. Björnsson’s second meal packs approximately 1,390 calories. High-calorie liquid additions to meals make strongman dieting easier,” Dr. Israetel said. Meal three provides approximately 1,350 calories. For meals four and five, Björnsson repeats meals two and three. His current meal plan has resulted in noticeable gains in strength and size, fueling him to attempt another deadlift world record at the 2025 World Deadlift Championships on Sept. 6, 2025, in Las Vegas, NV.

But is it all hype? The most recent research suggests collagen may not live up to the claims that permeate the fitness world . Dr. Layne Norton , Ph.D. in Nutritional Sciences, doubts collagen’s value. Collagen supplementation looks like a scam. I am skeptical. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, helping make up the skin, bones, tendons, ligaments , and cartilage. There are at least 16 types, but types I, II, and III are closely tied to fitness and joint /skin health. There are four main ways collagen works in the body: Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice . The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. To separate fact from marketing, a 2023 randomized controlled trial from Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise examined how collagen supplementation affects muscle connective tissue protein synthesis after exercise. The findings showed that collagen ingestion during recovery did not increase connective tissue protein synthesis , suggesting that it may not enhance muscle and tendon repair the way some supplements claim. ( 1 ) A post shared by Jeremy L. Buendia (@jeremy_buendia) If muscle and connective tissue don’t benefit, what about skin? New evidence indicates collagen might not help skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles. A 2025 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials, including 1,474 participants, found improvements only in pharma-funded studies. In contrast, research not funded by pharmaceutical companies reported no significant benefits. ( 2 ) Excluding outlier studies, collagen supplements showed no significant improvements in wrinkles, hydration, or elasticity. Swapping collagen for whey protein might be the right move for strength, vitality, and muscle building . Whey protein consistently outperforms collagen in head-to-head comparisons for hypertrophy . ( 3 ) Research has shown no significant differences between whey and collagen for stimulating connective tissue synthesis, making collagen the inferior option for those seeking muscle growth or recovery benefits. ( 4 ) ( 5 ) “Collagen literally has the worst amino acid profile of any protein source on the market,” Dr. Norton asserted. “It is absurdly low in essential amino acids, specifically the branch chain amino acids and leucine, which stimulate muscle protein synthesis.” Everyone wants an edge in training, but high-quality research shows collagen’s effects on muscle and connective tissue are inconsistent. Its real-world impact on muscle growth, recovery, and skin health appears limited, leaving its effectiveness debatable.

( 1 ) The new data shows most benefits between 300 and 900 milligrams daily, typically taken for 8-12 weeks, with 600 milligrams being the most commonly effective dose . Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice . The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. The review was narrative rather than systematic, so no formal risk-of-bias scoring was applied. Eighty percent of studies were conducted on young men, with the first female randomized controlled trial only appearing in 2025, limiting data for females. Sample sizes were typically under 60 participants, and most studies lasted only 8-12 weeks, leaving long-term effects unclear. The muscle-building effects of ashwagandha are evident. “There is a discernible increase in lean mass that’s measured and verifiable,” Dr. Israetel explained, “It comes out to roughly a few pounds of muscle over that typical time course.” Approximately 25-40% of creatine’s muscle-building capacity; modest but meaningful. The results for strength were slightly better: the effects of “40 to 60% of the effect of creatine” for one-rep max improvements, typically showing 5-8% increases over 8-12 week programs. Ashwagandha appears to function through hormonal modulation. “Testosterone makes you jacked, cortisol makes you less jacked,” Dr. Israetel declared. “Testosterone makes you leaner, cortisol makes you less lean.” ( 2 )( 3 ) “If you reduce cortisol substantially with [ashwagandha] and boost testosterone, that’s where many of these other benefits really come from,” Dr. Israetel clarified. Ashwagandha appears to boost VO₂ max significantly, with studies showing approximately 4ml/kg/min improvements over 8-12 weeks. ( 4 ) This enhancement in aerobic capacity could improve recovery between sets and training sessions. Recovery markers showed improvement, demonstrating 10-20% better recovery scale scores and reduced soreness perception. A post shared by Blast Vitality (@blastvitality) Ashwagandha has robust effects on stress management, with multiple studies demonstrating anxiety reduction. ( 5 )( 6 )( 7 )( 8 ) This has psychological and physiological benefits, such as improved training outcomes through better sleep quality and lower chronic cortisol exposure. ( 9 ) While generally safe for most healthy adults, ashwagandha isn’t always completely side-effect-free, with many reports of undesirable mental and physical reactions. Reducing stress and anxiety, though good, could interfere with natural emotions if excessive. The review positions ashwagandha as a “moderate multi-mechanism adjunct” rather than a tier-one supplement like creatine. Ashwagandha provides roughly half of creatine’s physiological effects plus more benefits. Stressful periods like the latter stages of fat loss, when cortisol levels are elevated, may be optimal for ashwagandha dosing. Taking 300-600mg daily of high-quality extract in the morning may offer a low-risk option for modest but noticeable improvements. Always speak to your physician before taking new supplements.

Analyzed by the House of Hypertrophy (HoH), the research reveals evidence that challenges conventional advice. One to five reps is considered the strength zone , where hypertrophy is observed. Due to mechanical tension, volume , fatigue management, and joint health, the six to 12 rep range is often considered the sweet spot for muscle growth . Could a few sets of three to five reps produce similar or better growth stimulus? Fourteen trained individuals with at least two years of lifting experience performed unilateral leg presses and extensions . (1) Subjects trained one leg for three to five reps to volitional failure using heavy loads, while the other leg performed 20-25 repetitions to failure with lighter weights. Workouts comprised three sets per session with two-minute rest periods between sets, training twice weekly for nine weeks. Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. “Muscle thickness increases were not significantly different between conditions,” HoH noted. As other research determined, vastly different rep ranges can produce similar hypertrophy outcomes. ( 2 )( 3 ) However, while whole muscle thickness increased for both rep ranges tested, neither showed increased muscle fiber cross-sectional area from biopsies, likely due to sampling limitations. “Biopsies obviously only extract a relatively small portion of muscle,” HoH reported. “In the paper, just over 150 fibers were contained per biopsy, but muscles, even small ones, usually comprise thousands of fibers.” Did all subjects train to failure equally, and does it matter? This wasn’t entirely clear, though verbal cues encouraged effort. Literature indicates that trained lifters might benefit from pushing sets to complete failure, but training habits and individual effort could skew outcomes. ( 4 ) Determining a minimum rep number to stimulate hypertrophy is complicated, as many studies report rep ranges. Individual variation, including genetics , training habits, nutrition , health, and workout fatigue, determines how people can perform different rep counts at the same percentage of their one-rep max . ( 5 ) HoH previously advocated for a six-to-35-rep range for hypertrophy. Only six studies examined five or fewer repetitions, with many having confounding variables, such as additional sets or longer rest periods. Adding additional sets of three to five reps and resting longer enhances growth stimulus. Only two studies support three to five reps with these variables; the total evidence base is relatively small. Small-sample studies can fail to represent reality due to measurement error, sampling variance, or genetic differences between groups. This study, while promising, is limited, with only 14 subjects. If your goal is to maximize muscle hypertrophy…train with six or more reps per set. Those benefitting from three to five reps should stick to it and mix rep ranges for joint health and varied stimuli. While the new study suggests three to five reps may maximize hypertrophy when performed to failure, evidence isn’t yet strong enough to confirm that it’s equally hypertrophic. Six reps and above remain a safer minimum to maximize muscle gains, but some lower-rep work is still good for strength and motor unit recruitment.

Intense training sessions drain the body’s carbohydrate reserves, which muscles depend on for performance. If those stores stay low, it can slow recovery and reduce the ability to grow muscle. ( 1 ) Pairing carbs with quality protein restores glycogen and spares muscle tissue from further breakdown. Carbs are massively anti-catabolic. They prevent muscle loss to a huge extent. Dr. Israetel believes that consuming a post-workout sooner rather than later helps to halt muscle breakdown, setting the stage for better recovery. ( 5 ) A post shared by Casey Kelly (@caseykellyfit) “Relatively low-fat, high-carb, high-quality protein within 30 minutes of your workout…no more check marks left,” Dr. Israetel explained. Even strength athletes and strongmen in a calorie surplus follow the same strategy: Aim for clean, nutrient-dense foods, then fill the gaps with higher-calorie options to meet energy demands. You have a total calorie budget to hit. Establish a core of healthy foods that give you the most benefits. Balancing high protein and carbs with low fat is Dr. Israetel’s recipe for rapid recovery and muscle growth.

You don’t need a bench to build bigger, stronger pecs , though. Proper exercise swaps can get the job done. In late August 2025, bodybuilder Simeon Panda shared his favorite alternatives to presses and flyes for the upper, mid, and lower pecs. Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. The flat bench press is a proven mid-pec builder that secondarily recruits the triceps and front delts. However, evidence indicates that dumbbell and machine presses offer comparable chest activation. A 2023 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found no significant differences in hypertrophy between dumbbell, barbell, and Smith machine presses . ( 1 ) Cable presses also elicit strong chest activation through EMG testing. ( 2 ) The incline bench press targets upper pec fibers, but some might find it causes discomfort for the front delts and rotator cuffs. A trio of incline options can get around these issues. Incline dumbbell presses fire the upper pecs and engage stabilizers more than barbells, helping build strength . ( 3 ) Smith incline presses offer a safer, guided bar path, but they may not engage muscles as much as free weights; participants in one study lifted roughly 3% more with a barbell bench press. ( 4 ) A post shared by Simeon Panda (@simeonpanda) Other options include the cable or machine presses. Measurements from a 2020 study found that a seated chest press with a neutral grip triggered greater activation of the upper chest compared to an overhand grip bench press. ( 5 ) As a pec deck substitute, dumbbell and cable flye variations isolate the pectoralis major. Data from the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine examined muscle activation from flyes. They found that standing variations provided a similar stimulus to the pec deck due to constant tension. ( 6 ) A post shared by Simeon Panda (@simeonpanda) Lower pec development is key for the “shelf” aesthetic . Panda’s answer is dumbbell pullovers . It’s a potent alternative, but the degree of pec activation varies based on shoulder angle. ( 7 ) Decline presses on a Smith machine or with dumbbells target the lower pecs. Dumbbells are slightly superior for muscle engagement, making them a strong choice as a workout finisher.

    "combined_text": "Biological age tests: Should you get one?\n\n<p>Plus, five FREE ways to test how quickly you’re aging—from home.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/biological-age-testing\">Biological age tests: Should you get one?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare Johnson, the subject of the Netflix documentary Don’t Die , says he’s on a quest to achieve the lowest possible “biological age” (also known as bio age). He reportedly spends millions each year on anti-aging treatments—dozens of daily supplements, weekly acid peels for his skin, injections to boost collagen production, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and plasma infusions extracted from his 17-year-old son’s body. To determine what’s working, Johnson has undergone numerous tests to assess his bio age. Johnson says these tests show his age is now 5.1 years younger than when he embarked on his anti-aging quest. Apparently, he’s aging in reverse. Granted, not everyone’s buying it. A New York Times exposé, for example, claims Johnson’s biological age, in reality, has increased by 10 years. 1 Still, Johnson’s “don’t die” crusade is gaining traction. Bio age tests are a frequent topic on popular podcasts by Peter Attia, Joe Rogan, and Andrew Huberman. Google “bio age testing” and you’ll see dozens of ads for mail-order blood or urine testing kits that claim to reveal your biological age, pace of aging, and more. With prices tumbling into affordability, it’s natural to wonder… Should you or your client sign up for bio age testing? If so, which test is best? Just as importantly, what should you do with the information? In this story, you’ll learn: Your biological age (bio age) refers to how your cells function. It’s not necessarily the same as your chronological age, which refers to the number of candles on your birthday cake. For example, let’s say Chang, a 50-year-old man, works at a desk, spends his free time in front of the TV, lives in the most polluted city in the world, eats a candy bar for lunch, and smokes. On the other hand, Jabari, a different 50-year-old man, hits the gym several times a week, lives in the mountains, doesn’t smoke, relishes his five servings of veggies a day, meditates, and spends most evenings in his garden. Genetics aside, you’d be wise to wager that Jabari’s bio age is younger than Chang’s. Bio age testing kits measure one or more biological markers of aging, also known as biomarkers . For example, some tests focus on the size of your telomeres , the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. Others measure DNA methylation , a physiological process that chemically alters DNA. Once a company isolates and measures these markers from your blood or urine, it plugs the bio data into a formula that calculates your bio age. However, if you see a doctor with any regularity, you’re likely already tracking some biomarkers of aging. For example, biomarkers such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood glucose can help predict your risk of future cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of premature death. Biomarker testing can help you monitor your wellness proactively rather than waiting for disease symptoms to appear. For some, it also serves as a motivator. If you learn you have the bones of someone 20 years older, this may give you the nudge you need to start strength training consistently. In addition, biomarkers provide objective data, allowing you to track and evaluate various health-related actions quantitatively. By monitoring your blood pressure, you might learn that consistent exercise helps, but your late-afternoon energy drink does the opposite. You don’t have to be a billionaire (or even a millionaire) to track biomarkers of aging. In this section, we’ll cover several massively underappreciated, scientifically validated tests you can use to gain insight into your bio age—for FREE. Before scientists developed high-tech blood-based bio age tests, researchers used these free tests to calculate the pace of aging in the people they studied. People who are fitter and stronger tend to live longer. 2 That’s because muscles do more than just move us around. They also secrete anti-inflammatory substances, help to regulate blood sugar, slow cellular aging, protect the lining of the arteries, and more. All this helps reduce the risk of age-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, a phenomenon we explore in our article, The New Science of Muscle. Related to strength, your ability to balance is also key. If you’re middle-aged or older and can’t stand on one foot for at least 10 seconds, your risk of dying in the next seven years is double that of someone who can stand for longer, according to a study of 1,700 people. 3 The Sitting-Rising Test (SRT) is one way to assess both strength and balance at the same time. People with low scores on this test have a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, according to a 12-year study of 4,200 adults between the ages of 46 and 75. 4 ▶ How to measure it Lower yourself to the floor with your legs in a crisscross position. Then, with your legs in the same position, stand back up. As you stand, notice if you must use a part of your body—hand, shin, knee—as leverage. To score yourself, start with 10 points. Then, for each body part you used to stand, deduct a point. Subtract a half point if you became unsteady or lost your balance. Keep in mind that this (and other tests) serve as a proxy for your fitness. A low score indicates that your balance and coordination, muscle strength and power, and mobility may all require some attention. Like the SRT test, your grip strength provides insight into your overall fitness. If the muscles in your hands are weak, the muscles throughout your body are more likely to be weak, too. Poor grip strength can also predict future muscle weakness. In one study, people with a weak grip were more likely to walk slowly and be unable to rise from a chair, complete rigorous housework, or climb a flight of steps 25 years later. 5 Low grip strength has also been associated with: 6 According to one study, grip strength was a better indicator of longevity (or lack thereof) than blood pressure. 7 ▶ How to measure it Grab a standard tennis ball, and squeeze as hard as you can, for as long as you can. If you can manage 15 to 30 seconds before your grip fatigues, you’re doing fine. Ninety seconds puts you well above average—anything over 90 ranks you solidly in the upper-third percentile. If you’re below 15, keep in mind that this test is also just one indicator of your overall strength. (And squeezing balls to improve grip strength without training the rest of your body is unlikely to make significant improvements in your overall health and fitness.) A hand-held dynamometer—available for use at most occupational therapists’ and some gyms—can also test grip strength. (If you’re willing to shell out some cash, you can buy your own for somewhere between $100 and $500.) An ability to balance on one foot for an extended period can help reduce your risk of falls, one of the leading causes of injury-related death among older adults. In addition, many different bodily systems—the eyes, inner ear, skeletal muscles, and brain—must work together to help you stay upright. Conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer can all affect balance. As a result, an inability to stand on one foot can serve as a warning sign for eroding health and fitness. 8 ▶ How to measure it Stand near a wall or chair for safety. Keep your eyes open and hands on your hips. Then, lift your dominant leg and start timing yourself. Once you put your foot down, stop the clock. Repeat the test with your non-dominant leg. Once you have your times, compare them to the following averages, from a study out of Duke University, to see how you did compared to your age-matched peers. 9 Sometimes you know why you’re tired, such as the morning after binge-watching the last few episodes of a thriller. Once you catch up on your sleep, the weariness lifts. That’s not the same thing as fatigue , which describes persistent exhaustion that worsens over time and interferes with life. In addition to feeling physically tired, someone who’s fatigued feels mentally dull and emotionally exhausted. Think of fatigue as an early sign that something’s off, especially if you don’t know the cause. Let’s say you’ve already ruled out the usual suspects like too much caffeine, dehydration, too much alcohol, medication side effects, chronic stress, or too much or too little exercise. What’s left is likely a sleep disorder or a developing health problem such as anemia, obesity, depression, cancer, or diabetes, to name a few. If you’re 60 or older, fatiguability —or how worn out you feel after an activity—can also predict longevity. According to research out of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the higher someone scores in fatiguability, the higher their risk of death in the future. 10 Other research has linked high fatiguability with declines in gait speed, walking ability, and other tests of fitness. 11 ▶ How to measure it To measure fatigability, use a tool called the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale. Using a 0 (no fatigue) to 5 (extreme fatigue) scale, rate how fatigued you think you would feel after completing the following activities: If you score less than 15, you’re doing well. Scores between 15 and 24 are a warning sign. Anything 25 and above is regarded as severe, and worth mentioning to your healthcare professional. 12 Despite popular belief, both too little and too much body fat can influence health for the worse, as we explore in our infographic, Is body fat good or bad for you? Your muscle mass also plays a role, which is why someone’s body composition matters more than their weight . The gold standard methods that estimate body composition—underwater weighing, air displacement (Bod Pod), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)—certainly aren’t free. However, a recent study determined that a good old-fashioned (and cheap) tape measure can provide a comparably accurate estimate of body composition. 13 ▶ How to measure it To use a tape measure to keep track of your body fat percentage, measure: Ensure the tape is snug but not so tight that it cuts into the skin. Once you have your measurements, plug those numbers—along with your age, sex, height, and weight—into our FREE Body Fat Calculator , which will take it from there. Depending on where you live in the world, the following tests may not be free. However, as part of routine preventative care, your insurance might cover them. If your primary care doctor recommends yearly blood work, it’s for good reason. By keeping tabs on several blood markers, you can see if your health is trending toward type 2 diabetes or heart disease, both leading causes of premature mortality. Many blood markers can also be influenced relatively quickly (within 6 to 12 weeks) through lifestyle changes, supplement protocols, or medications. This makes them practical tools for monitoring whether various lifestyle or medical modifications are working. ▶ How to measure it If you’re not already doing so, consider having the following blood markers tested annually. Then, talk to your health care professional about what your numbers mean. They might use the following numbers, along with your blood pressure, to calculate a cardiovascular disease risk score. *Milligrams per deciliter of blood **Milligrams per liter When researchers study healthy super-agers aged 90 and older, strong bones are one of their defining features. 14 That may be because, like muscles, bones are live organs that secrete substances that may be beneficial to overall health and longevity. 15 For example, bones secrete osteocalcin , a hormone that plays a role in bone remodeling. When osteocalcin circulates in the body, it’s thought to play a role in everything from helping muscles to produce ATP to regulating brain neurotransmitters. Because of these varied roles, it’s thought that, as bones wear away, osteocalcin levels drop, contributing to many age-related health problems, including diabetes, low muscle mass, and cognitive issues. 16 17 (At least, that’s the theory. Most of this research has been done on mice.) Osteocalcin aside, loss of bone density can, of course, lead to fractures, which can increase your risk of death for up to 10 years after a break. 18 It’s especially important to keep tabs on bone health if you’re in any of these high-risk categories: ▶ How to measure it Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans are a type of X-ray that measures the amount of bone mineral content packed into a square centimeter of bone. Insurance often won’t cover these scans for people younger than 65 unless there’s a documented risk of developing osteoporosis. Out of pocket, the average cost is about $300. When you receive your DEXA results, you’ll see a T-score that represents how your bone density compares to the average bone density of a young adult with peak bone mass. A T-score of +1.0 to -1.0 means you have normal bone mineral density for someone your age. Anything below -1.0 means you might have osteopenia (low bone mineral density) or osteoporosis (porous bones that are prone to fracture). If you have some money to burn, you can learn an awful lot about your body. Here, you’ll find a quick run-down on some of the more high-tech tests you can get and what they can tell you. However, before we get into the details, we want to point out a few caveats: ▶ Biological age can vary over time, and by organ. Someone may go through a period of accelerated aging—saying, during a period of intense stress—then their rate of aging may slow as they focus more on recovery. Additionally, organs can age at different rates. For example, someone with heart disease may have a relatively older heart than their kidneys. (Not all tests measure individual organ age, but it’s becoming more common.) ▶ Commercial tests won’t always accurately reflect the changes you’re making. Until more research supports the reliability of these tests, evaluate your behaviors over isolated test results. If you’re eating more fruits and veggies, exercising more consistently, managing stress, and otherwise slaying the healthy lifestyle department, don’t sweat your results. Focus on doing the things we know improve health. ▶ If a company pairs your test results with a hard sell for a proprietary and expensive supplement protocol, be wary. It’s better to share and discuss your results with a trusted health professional than take health advice from a profit-seeking stranger over the internet. DNA methylation is a biological process that chemically alters DNA. Because the rate of methylation accelerates with aging, it can be used to estimate someone’s biological age and life expectancy, finds research. 19 20 21 The Horvath Clock and DunedinPACE both measure specific biomarkers that can be used to better understand someone’s methylation rate. Scientists developed these tests to help other scientists study how various lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and medicines affect aging. They didn’t develop the tests as a way for the average person to pinpoint their biological age. (Which hasn’t stopped companies from selling DNA methylation testing kits to the public.) They cost about $300. If you decide to get one of these tests, keep in mind your results won’t give you a complete picture of your health and longevity. Aging typically occurs at varying rates throughout the body. Your liver might age faster than your heart or brain, for example. So if you measure DNA methylation in your blood, that’s all you know about. Put another way, a DNA methylation test isn’t a substitute for your annual wellness checkup or blood work. Telomeres—the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes—wear away with age. The length of a telomere can predict how many times a specific cell can divide before dying. Abnormally short telomeres are associated with several genetic diseases. For this reason, when physicians suspect someone might have inherited a genetic disease, they’ll order a specific type of telomere test—the flow-FISH test —to measure the telomere length in all the cells in a blood sample. 22 23 It’s more debatable whether telomere tests can predict aging in healthy people. Just as importantly, the telomere test marketed to the public, known as the qPCR telomere test , isn’t used in research or medicine. These $100 tests are fine if you’re merely curious—just don’t base health and fitness decisions on your results. For years, only elite athletes cared about VO2 max, which describes the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can use during exercise. More recently, however, some experts have suggested that VO2 max can serve as a measure for athletes and non-athletes alike to track the rate at which their bodies are aging. People with high VO2 max tend not only to be more physically fit but also less likely to develop heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke. 24 25 26 27 In an observational study that followed the health outcomes of 5,107 Danish men over 46 years, men with above-average V02 max during middle age lived an average of five years longer than men with below-average V02 max. Each unit increase in VO2 max was associated with a 45-day increase in longevity. The researchers suggested VO2 max may more accurately predict all-cause mortality than high cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance. 28 You might think of V02 max as a canary and your aging body as a coal mine. As you age, your chest wall becomes more rigid, the muscles that surround the lungs weaker, and the oxygen-carrying blood vessels calcified and less elastic. The heart also squeezes with less force, max heart rate drops, muscle mass and strength decline, the mitochondria in cells and muscles lose their effectiveness, among other differences. In addition to raising your risk for many different diseases, these changes can also affect VO2 max, which tends to decline 10 percent per decade starting around age 30. 29 30 In the past, the only way to reliably measure VO2 max was in a fitness lab. You would wear a metabolic mask and a heart monitor while you ran or cycled to exhaustion. The mask collected your expired carbon dioxide and monitored how much oxygen you sucked into your lungs. This lab-based testing is still the most accurate way to measure V02 max as well as other key fitness metrics such as: Depending on where you live, you might be able to get your VO2 max tested for around $150. However, if you don’t have access to a VO2 max clinic, three somewhat less accurate options exist. ▶ The 1-mile walk test Wear a heart rate monitor as you walk one mile on a flat surface, such as a treadmill or running track. As soon as you complete the mile, record your heart rate and walk time. Then, plug it into the following formula to calculate your VO2 max: 132.853 — (0.0769 × Weight) — (0.3877 × Age) + (6.315 × Sex) — (3.2649 × Time) — (0.1565 × Heart rate) If that feels like too much math, you can also use a free online tool . ▶ The smartwatch test Many smartwatches will estimate your VO2 Max for you based on information the watch gathers from your workouts, sex, and age. Compared to in-office testing, smart watches can over- or underestimate V02 max, especially in people who are very out of shape or extremely fit. 31 Because of this, you don’t necessarily want to use your smart watch measurement to determine your current state of health. However, it can help you to see trends. For example, does your VO2 estimate drop after a few weeks of skipping your usual spin class? If so, that’s good information to have. ▶ The PR test Fitness performance correlates with longevity. If you’re getting faster at running a certain distance or can go a longer distance than before, you’re getting fitter and increasing your chances of living a long, healthy life. One way to test this: the 12-minute run test, also known as the Cooper test. (This is a validated way to estimate VO2 max—and shows about a 90 percent correlation with lab-based measurements.) Here’s how it works: Run as fast as you can on a flat surface, such as a treadmill set at a 1 percent incline or running track, for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, record your distance. Then, plug it into one of the following formulas to calculate your VO2 max. In lieu of doing math, you can also use a free online calculator . Try to think of the information you gather about your body as just that—information. It’s not a moral judgment of who you are as a person. Just as importantly, it’s not a permanent situation. You have options. However, most people make two big mistakes when it comes to longevity-related lifestyle changes. It’s the simple, boring, “I’ve heard this a million times before” health practices that, when done consistently, add up to a long, healthy life. We’re talking about things like… And that’s just a partial list. According to thousands of studies, people who practice these and other high-impact strategies not only live longer, but also live better. They’re stronger, happier, and less likely to spend their later years disabled or in pain. (If you’d like to see where you stand when it comes to big impact health and longevity strategies, check out our FREE Longevity Assessment .) However, when it comes to health, fitness, and longevity, many people pursue options with minimal impact (at best). They reach for the latest, trendy supplement rather than taking steps to quit smoking, as just one example. Here’s the thing: Big rock strategies require changes in behavior. If daily physical activity were as easy as popping a pill, walkers and cyclists would clog up the streets in your neighborhood. (It’s precisely this reason why so many people need the support of a certified health coach who has undergone training in the science of behavior change.) The data gathered from biomarker aging tests can give you a sense of control. However… Data, in isolation, doesn’t lead to a longer life. Gathering data without changing your behavior is like checking your reflection in the mirror, seeing spinach wedged between your incisors, and leaving it there. You need to remove the spinach for the mirror check to be worthwhile. Biomarker testing is the same. If you don’t use your bio data to inform behavior change, you’re wasting your money and time. Consider your biomarker data as a baseline or starting point. Then, use it to assess whether various lifestyle changes or medical interventions are moving you closer to your goal of living a longer, healthier life.

Some people with IBS experience bouts of abdominal pain they describe as worse than childbirth. These flare-ups can siphon concentration, interrupt sleep, and destroy work productivity. 3 As a result, many people with IBS plan their lives around the availability of private, clean bathrooms. Fear of a sudden flare-up leads some to avoid restaurants, get-togethers, even exercising in public. This pervading worry has a name— gastrointestinal-specific anxiety —and it can affect everything from social relationships to overall well-being. It’s also the main reason people with IBS report worse quality of life than people with other chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and end-stage kidney disease. 4 PN Super Coach Sarah Maughan, certified through Monash University—a global leader in understanding the link between food sensitivities and IBS—has witnessed how lifestyle changes can prevent flare-ups, calm GI anxiety, and allow people with IBS to live the lives they want. “My hope is for everyone with IBS to know they have options, whether that’s turning to a physician for medication and/or a health coach to learn about lifestyle changes and how to put them into action,” says Maughan. In this article, we’ll hear more from Maughan. You’ll also learn: Plus, if you’re a health coach, you’ll learn how to support clients with IBS while safely staying within your scope of practice. Sometimes referred to as “spastic colon,” IBS is the most commonly diagnosed digestive disorder in the world, affecting about 14 percent percent of adults. 5 Unlike Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), IBS doesn’t alter the architecture of the gut. When healthcare professionals use diagnostic imaging, they find no infections, inflammation, damage to the bowel wall, or other evidence of disease. Years ago, this lack of visible disease led many healthcare professionals to assume that IBS was purely psychological. More recently, however, this thinking has shifted. Experts now view IBS as a functional neuro-gastrointestinal disorder. That means the nerves between the GI tract and the brain don’t function optimally, causing the brain to deliver unnecessary pain signals and interfere with typical bowel function. IBS symptoms can come and go, with some people experiencing months or years of relief only to suffer a severe flare-up that can last hours to weeks. In addition, not everyone with IBS experiences the same set of symptoms, which can make the condition challenging to diagnose. The below illustration shows the range of IBS symptoms.  Researchers are still trying to understand why the gut functions differently in people with IBS. However, they do have a few theories. According to one hypothesis, the nerve endings in the GI tract may be overly sensitive in people with IBS. This can lead to two different sets of symptoms. ▶ Hypersensitive nerves communicate pain signals to the brain, causing people with IBS to notice digestive processes that other people wouldn’t feel. Tiny gas bubbles may be severely uncomfortable for someone with IBS, for example, but not bother someone without the disorder. ▶ Overreactive nerves can trigger GI muscles to contract with too much force, leading to gas, bloating, and diarrhea. If they underreact, the same muscles don’t contract forcefully enough, which slows the passage of food through the intestine and leads to constipation. Another theory blames disturbances on the gut microbiome , which helps to explain why some people develop IBS symptoms after first having a severe GI illness like the Norovirus. If you or your client suspect IBS, see a credentialed health professional. The symptoms of IBS overlap with several other gastrointestinal diseases and health conditions that can require medication, surgery, or medically-supervised lifestyle changes. These include infections, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, cancer, and food allergies, among others. It’s especially important to see a medical professional if you or your client notice any of the following: In addition to ruling out other GI conditions, a healthcare professional will also ask detailed questions about you or your client’s symptoms. This information allows them to pinpoint which IBS “type” you or your client might have: You or your client’s IBS type will inform what your healthcare professional recommends. A healthcare provider might suggest a short course of antibiotics and antidiarrheal medicine for IBS-D. On the other hand, for IBS-C, they might recommend a fiber supplement, non-habit-forming laxative, laxative-like medication, or other medicine that reduces the perception of pain and regulates bowel movements. In order to get the most out of the visit, you can help your client (or yourself) prepare for a healthcare appointment. A healthcare professional will likely ask the following questions, so consider the responses beforehand: Another way to prepare for your first appointment? Well, you might not like it, but it’s a good idea to… Consider keeping a poo diary for a couple of weeks before your appointment. In the diary, track the frequency of bowel movements and other symptoms. Use the Bristol Stool Chart (below) to take note of the quality of your poo. This information can help your healthcare professional assess whether you have IBS and which type.  (To learn more about the clues your poos can hide, read: 6 reasons you should care about your poop health ) In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved several new prescription medicines for IBS, along with a medical device that stimulates the cranial nerves behind the ear. In addition, thousands of research papers have looked at the interaction between IBS and various lifestyle habits, with many promising findings. Here are five evidence-based ways to reduce the symptoms of IBS (and bonus, many of them are great for enhancing overall health too). People with IBS who exercise regularly tend to experience fewer symptoms and flare-ups than people who don’t exercise. When researchers asked people with IBS to walk moderately for an hour three times a week, study participants experienced significant relief from bloating and abdominal pain within 12 weeks. 6 How exercise soothes IBS isn’t fully understood, though. According to other research, exercise may reduce stress and improve mental health, which, in turn, may help improve communication between the gut and the brain. 7 8 Another theory argues that exercise helps encourage the growth of health-promoting gut bacteria, which may help to break down food more efficiently and decrease inflammation. 9 Anxiety, stress, and depression all activate stress hormones like norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and cortisol, which can: Of course, stress doesn’t come with an on/off switch. Simply telling yourself, “Stop getting so stressed out!” won’t likely help—and may even paradoxically lead to more stress. That’s why Precision Nutrition-certified coaches like Maughan help clients learn to focus on what’s within their control—such as practicing self-compassion, or experimenting with nervous system regulators like yoga, breathing exercises, and gentle walking. As the image below illustrates, clients can control how they perceive, respond to, and anticipate stressors—but not always the stressors themselves.  Either way, when clients focus more on what they can control and less on what they can’t, they often feel calmer and more capable. (If you want to help a client figure out just what’s within their control—and what’s not—try out our free worksheet: Sphere of Control Worksheet ) (Assess your current stress load by taking our free quiz: Do you have a Stress Bod? ) PN coaches have long appreciated and advocated slower, more relaxed eating. Yes, slow eating helps people fill up on fewer calories—but it also tends to help clients reduce or even eliminate GI woes like acid reflux, bloating, and pain . For one, slower eating often translates to more chewing. In addition to mechanically mashing food into a pulp, increased chewing also allows the mouth’s digestive enzymes to pre-digest food. As a result, the stomach and intestines have to work less hard. Plus, eating in a relaxed setting often lowers stress hormones like norepinephrine and cortisol, making it less likely that they will intensify GI pain signals. According to Maughan, this can be especially important for young parents, as it’s not always easy to eat undistracted and peacefully when tending to little ones. (Sounds simple, but slow eating is more challenging than people think—and a lot more impactful. Learn more: Try the slow-eating 30-day challenge .) According to research, people with IBS experience more shallow, less restorative, and more interrupted sleep. 13 Because of poor sleep quality, many people with IBS sleep more hours overall than people without IBS—yet feel less rested. Fatigue can then set off a vicious cycle. When people don’t sleep restfully, stress hormone levels tend to be higher, which can exacerbate gut pain. 14 Unrested people also tend to feel hungrier during the day. Cravings for fats and sweets also intensify, driving people to reach for the very foods more likely to trigger IBS symptoms—and wolf them down too quickly. Stopping this cycle can be challenging. As with stress, you can’t simply will yourself to sleep more restfully. However, the first three strategies—exercise, stress management, and slower eating—can all help. Some PN clients have found that consuming a smaller dinner earlier in the evening gives their bodies more time to digest before bed. Other clients tell us that a relaxing pre-bedtime routine—a few minutes of foam rolling, a guided meditation, a bath, or some journalling—tends to help. (Find out the best practices for getting better sleep by checking out our infographic: The power of sleep ) While there’s no one-size-fits-all IBS diet, experts have identified several food categories that are more likely to be problematic for many people. These include: ▶ Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAPs) , which are a family of carbohydrate-rich foods that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. Even in people without IBS, these foods tend to slow digestion and attract water. When gut bacteria ferment them, they produce gas, which can stretch the intestinal wall. For most, this slowed digestion and gas isn’t especially noticeable; In people with IBS, it can lead to intense pain. High-FODMAP foods include wheat, rye, barley, onions, garlic, beans, dairy, honey, cashews, some processed meats, and many fruits and vegetables. (More about FODMAPs in the next section.) ▶ Caffeinated beverages and foods , especially coffee, which trigger the release of stress hormones, stimulate the production of stomach acid, increase muscle contractions in the colon, and irritate the lining of the intestine. 15 ▶ Alcohol and spicy foods that irritate the gut. 16 17 ▶ High fructose corn syrup and sugar alcohols such sorbitol and mannitol, which have been linked to gas, bloating, and diarrhea in susceptible people. 18 19 ▶ Fatty, greasy foods , which can slow digestion and attract water, leading to loose stools, bloating, and gas. 20 21 If the idea of giving up all the foods and beverages on the above list has you in a cold sweat, know this… Not everyone with IBS is sensitive to the same foods and beverages. “Everyone can have different triggers,” says Maughan. “That’s why it’s so important to figure out what makes your body feel good and what doesn’t.” Some people struggle with apples but are okay with berries. Others can drink green tea but not black. One person might be able to consume five to eight ounces of beer but not 12. A gluten-free diet may work great for some but not others. Similarly, many people find relief by avoiding certain high-FODMAP foods. However, you may only be sensitive to some FODMAPs and not others. If so, eliminating all FODMAPs would be unnecessarily restrictive and difficult to follow consistently. For this reason, it can be helpful to try an elimination diet to see which foods and beverages are problematic—along with the quantities you can safely tolerate , says Maughan. You’ll learn more about elimination diets in the next section. (Want someone to walk you through exactly how to do an elimination diet? Read: How and why to do an elimination diet. ) In our online coaching communities, we often see people asking some version of the following question: “My client just told me that she has IBS. Am I allowed to continue to coach this person?” The answer: Yes, you certainly can. As we mentioned, Maughan specializes in helping people with digestive problems. Coaching someone with IBS is no different than coaching a client with any other nutritional goal, she says. “Because IBS is often largely associated with what someone eats, it’s within a coach’s wheelhouse—with some caveats,” says Maughan. “You can’t diagnose your client with the condition, and you should make it clear that you’re not prescribing a diet for them. In addition, you should encourage clients to seek care from a medical professional, especially if you suspect something other than IBS is going on.” To stay within your scope of practice, follow these do’s and don’ts.  Elimination diets do what the name suggests: They exclude certain foods for a short period—usually three weeks. Then, you slowly reintroduce specific foods and monitor your symptoms for possible reactions. Elimination diets work a lot like a science experiment that helps you identify problematic foods. The phrase “elimination diet” may sound scary and off-putting, as if you’ll be living for months on bland food you have to slurp through a straw. However, there are many different types of elimination diets, with some much less restrictive than others. Here are a few versions. This is an excellent option for people who suspect they already know which foods and beverages trigger symptoms. It goes like this: You eliminate up to four foods for several weeks. Then, slowly reintroduce them one at a time to see if your symptoms return. Let’s say, for example, from experience, you know you feel bad whenever you eat dairy. On the lite elimination diet, you’d eliminate just dairy for three weeks. Then you’d reintroduce it to see how you feel. If you’re unsure of how food interacts with your GI tract—but aren’t ready for a super restrictive eating plan, our Precision Nutrition elimination diet is likely the way to go. Created by PN and approved by several registered dietitians, the plan removes many of the foods most likely to cause problems, while still including a variety of vegetables, fruits, starches, legumes, nuts, seeds, and meats, so you can continue to eat a well-balanced diet. To learn more, download our FREE Ultimate Guide to Elimination Diets . This ebook has everything you need to be successful, including an at-a-glance chart that helps you easily follow the diet, along with recipes, meal ideas, and tip sheets. Over several years, researchers at Monash University in Australia have developed and extensively studied a low-FODMAP elimination diet for people with IBS. 22 Unlike other types of elimination diets, the FODMAP diet is a highly specialized form of medical nutrition therapy. The FODMAP diet’s list of problematic foods (shown below) is anything but intuitive, and the reintroduction phase is more complex than other elimination diets. As a result, if you’ve been diagnosed with IBS and suspect you have a FODMAP issue, seek the expertise of a FODMAP-certified practitioner. You can also download Monash University’s FODMAP Diet app , which will help you navigate low-FODMAP eating. In isolation, more knowledge doesn’t always lead to more power. For example, there’s a difference between knowing that dairy messes with your gut and doing something with that knowledge . Similarly, you might know that you feel better when you eat a small dinner earlier in the evening, but you may struggle to plan your life so an early dinner happens regularly. This is where a certified health coach can help. “Many of my clients already have an idea of the foods that tend to cause them problems,” says Maughan, “But they’re nervous to know for sure because they fear that the knowledge will make eating more challenging.” That’s why Maughan assures clients… Even if you do an elimination diet and you learn your favorite food is contributing to your IBS, you don’t have to do anything with that information . You can choose to continue to eat your favourite foods if you want, AND you can choose to avoid them when it’s really important for you not to experience IBS symptoms, she says. “With knowledge, you have choices,” says Maughan.

Is it all necessary? </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/the-cost-of-health-optimization\">The True Cost of “Optimal” Health</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare We hear this kind of thing a lot. People tell us they not only want to stay in good shape as they age, they also want to outlive their peers and age expectancies. Imagine you could maximize your healthspan and lifespan, fend off disease, and generally remain fit, lean, and youthful into your 90’s, 100’s, and then some. Sounds pretty compelling, doesn’t it? There’s just one problem: Common longevity advice seems to involve an extraordinary amount of effort. And time. And money. And complexity. Is all the effort necessary? Is it worth it? And, will it even work? In this article, we’ll explore: And, we’ll help you weigh the pros and cons so you can make informed decisions about your health, your body, and your life. Health and longevity advice is everywhere these days: podcasts, books, social media, that guy at the gym… Plus, influential “figureheads” have given the movement outsized attention. Think: popular podcasters and health experts Dr. Peter Attia, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and biohacker Bryan Johnson. We understand the appeal of this kind of content. Who doesn’t want a longer, healthier life? (Not to mention the comforting sense of control that can come from designing and executing a “perfect” health plan.) But for us at PN, where we’ve collectively coached hundreds of thousands of people with real human lives, we know that “optimal” is rarely realistic. Not only that, optimal isn’t necessary . Making modest, relatively consistent efforts towards health and well-being will likely give you better results than following an intense, highly “optimized” protocol. If that sounds hard to believe, we get it. So let’s explore that bold statement, starting with the biggest myths surrounding longevity and health optimization. There’s an idea that getting and staying healthy must require a set of complex, “cutting edge” strategies—especially if your goal is to outlive the average American. In reality, the “basics” work really, really well. (These are things like exercising regularly; eating a nutrient-rich diet; getting adequate sleep; managing stress; and staying socially connected. We’ll discuss these more later.) Only, very few people do the basics consistently. The real reason more people aren’t living as long, or as well, as they could be isn’t because they’re not taking ice baths or getting vitamin C infusions… It’s because they’re not doing the (relatively) simple stuff, consistently. If you’re really, truly doing a well-rounded set of health-promoting behaviors with 80-90 percent consistency, you’re probably already close to peak optimization. If a handful of basic behaviors get results, then doing them perfectly and as much as possible will help you get, and stay, even healthier—right? Not so fast. There’s a law of diminishing returns when it comes to health and fitness efforts.  Plus, in our experience, doing too many things or adding in too much complexity to your health and fitness regime can: And what’s the point of living longer if you’re not living a full, well-rounded, enjoyable life? While some effort is definitely important, past a certain point, more isn’t necessarily better. Let’s say you could put all those advanced, complex strategies into action without sacrificing consistency or life enjoyment, or compromising your overall well-being. They’d have to pay off, wouldn’t they? Not necessarily. Much of the research on longevity optimization (so far) is either in mice, is observational, is theoretical, or has been tested on very small numbers of people for very short periods of time. In fact, many of the fringe methods and supplements touted by influencers or biohackers are not only unproven but even potentially unsafe. 3 4 5 6 Point being: Put your efforts towards foundational health behaviors with proven track records (the kind we’ll cover in this article) before you invest in fringe efforts. You might think, “Well, I’m not getting out of bed at 5 a.m. five times a week to go running for 60 to 90 minutes to optimize my VO₂ max, so I may as well just accept I’m not going to be a healthy person.” Some folks feel overwhelmed by the idea of optimizing their health, so they figure they might as well do nothing. However, our internal data shows that you can be far from “perfect” to get results. In our year long PN Coaching program, even clients who practiced their (basic) habits less than half of the time got measurable results.  (Read more: Nearly 1 million data points show what it REALLY takes to lose fat, get healthy, and change your body ) Instead, we encourage you to… Keep reading and we’ll guide you through it. Putting effort towards your health is great. But efforts come with tradeoffs. Here’s a look at both the efforts, and the tradeoffs, to achieve the health you want for yourself.  How do your health and longevity efforts stack up? What can you do to make the biggest difference? Take The Longevity Assessment and find out! To begin, simply click “Get started” below.  Get started © Precision Nutrition If you want to reduce your risk of chronic disease, and generally stay healthier for longer, what should you do? As we said earlier, the issue isn’t that we need some highly detailed, cutting-edge protocol. The basics work. The issue is that most people don’t do them. For example, as shown in the image below, most people don’t get enough fruits and veggies, sleep, or exercise. And the number of people who do all these things on a regular basis (while also avoiding tobacco and minimizing alcohol) is extremely low: likely a fraction of a percent.  Finally, let’s take a closer look at what these basics are, and the “sweet spot” of effort versus reward. All health experts agree: Moving your body is important. Yes, exercise will help you stay lean, and improve mood, energy, and function, but it will also help you stay alive (and healthier) for longer. In fact, a study of Harvard alumni found that any amount of physical activity reduces the risk of death from any cause. Exercise extended lifespan regardless of body weight, blood pressure, smoking habits, or genetic predisposition. 7 Another study of 272,550 older adults found engaging in even low amounts of physical activity significantly decreased risk of death from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all causes. 8 Specifically, steep risk declines happened when accumulating at least 7.5 MET-hours* of activity per week. The greatest increase in benefits came from achieving 7.5 to 15 MET hours. Increasing activity beyond that further decreases risk, but at a continually lower rate, as the graph below shows.  *MET-hours (Metabolic Equivalent Hours) measures the energy cost of activity, based on duration and intensity. Some examples: 2 hours of resting = ~2 MET-hours; 2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity = ~8 MET-hours; 2 hours of moderate resistance training = ~7 MET-hours. Increasing the intensity of exercise is an efficient way to rack up MET-hours, but plain old walking counts too: In a study of 28,000 adults, every 1,000 daily step increase was associated with a 12 percent lower risk of death . (This association began at 2,500 steps and continued up to 17,000 steps.) 9 (Cool factoid: For folks concerned with dementia in particular, one study showed that getting just 3,826 steps per day was associated with a 25 percent reduced risk of dementia—and getting 9,826 steps per day was associated with a 50 percent lower risk! 10 ) Ideally, cardiovascular activity is paired with resistance or weight-bearing exercise. Resistance training supports health and longevity in various ways: it can help preserve valuable muscle mass, maintain mental sharpness, improve odds of surviving cancer, support metabolic health, and generally help you stay alive. 11 Among older adults especially, falls are a leading cause of death. 12 Resistance training can both prevent the risk of falls–because of improved balance and muscle stability 13 —as well as reduce the risk of serious injury–because of better bone density. 14 A sedentary lifestyle does the opposite, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer (breast, colon, colorectal, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancer), and all-cause mortality. 15 In fact, two decades of sedentary lifestyle is associated with twice the risk of premature death compared to being physically active. 16 ▶ How much exercise should you do? Standard exercise recommendations suggest: 17 Getting up to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or some mix of both) as well as three resistance training sessions per week provides further benefits. ▶ Are people getting enough exercise? Most people are not. Only 24 percent meet the recommendations for both aerobic and resistance exercise. And fewer than 47 percent of American adults meet recommendations for aerobic physical activity. 17 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? For the most part yes, but past a certain point, more effort delivers less benefit—and potentially more risk. Overtraining (and/or under-recovering) can disrupt hormone levels, mess with sleep and mood, cause excess fatigue, chronically elevate your heart rate, cause injuries, and more. 18 19 Extreme volumes of endurance exercise training may be detrimental for the heart, and increase risk of myocardial fibrosis, coronary artery calcification, and atrial fibrillation. 20 21 22 23 So, the benefits of exercise exist on a U-shaped curve. (This is known as the “Extreme Exercise Hypothesis, ” 24 as seen in the image below.)  A “high” amount of exercise is good for you, but the “highest” amount possible probably isn’t. (Health benefits likely max out around 7-10 hours of cardio, and 3-4 resistance training sessions per week.) We like what one study concluded: “If the mantra ‘exercise is medicine’ is embraced, underdosing and overdosing are possible.” 25 Eating well doesn’t have to be complicated. There are a few key elements to nail down, and the rest is up to your own personal preferences and needs. We suggest focusing on three nutrition fundamentals. Whole and minimally-processed foods are naturally nutrient rich—complete with fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals—and far less calorie-dense than highly- or ultra-processed foods (UPFs). They also have less sugar, sodium, and trans fats—the latter which is directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, complications during pregnancy, colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, and allergy. 26 27 28 These qualities contribute to their many health benefits; Diets rich in whole or minimally-processed foods are associated with lower rates of depression, 29 30 31 heart disease, 32 type 2 diabetes, 33 cancer, 34 and improved longevity. 35 The largest study on processed foods—which included almost 10 million participants—found UPFs are linked to 32 harmful effects, including type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. 36 Another study found that a higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (four or more servings daily) was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of all-cause mortality. (For each additional serving of ultra-processed food, all-cause mortality increased by 18 percent.) 37 Not that you need to be plucking tomatoes straight off the vine. Eating a minimally processed food diet is more about overall dietary patterns—and moving along the continuum of improvement—rather than rigidly avoiding all forms of processing.  ▶ How many minimally-processed foods should you eat? There currently aren’t any formal guidelines for the amount of minimally-processed foods to eat. In our experience coaching over 100,000 clients, we find people are most satisfied, and get significant health improvements, when 70 to 80 percent of their diet comes from whole or minimally-processed foods. Any improvement counts though. If you’re currently eating very few whole and minimally processed foods, getting at least 50 percent of your diet from these foods would make a big difference to your health, energy, and longevity. ▶ Are people eating enough minimally-processed foods? No. Recent US data shows that Americans get about 28.5 percent of their calories from whole or minimally-processed foods, and 56 percent of their calories from highly- or ultra-processed foods. 38 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Not beyond a certain point. If you want to, consuming up to 90 percent of calories from minimally-processed foods will truly maximize your benefits, but beyond that there are likely no further benefits. Besides, some processed foods enhance health rather than detract from it. Think about the protein powder that helps you meet your protein requirements, the commercial salad dressing that helps you eat your vegetables, or the weekly brownie à la mode you share with your grandkid that brings joy to both of your lives. (Read more: What you should know about minimally-processed foods vs. highly-processed foods ) You’ve heard it a million times. We’ll be the nag and say it again: Eat your fruits and veggies. A massive study involving over 1.8 million people showed that eating more fruits and vegetables was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death—with the benefits plateauing at five servings a day. People who ate five servings a day had a 13 percent lower risk of death from any cause compared to people who ate two servings per day. 39 Additionally, the consumption of fruits and vegetables very likely reduces the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke; probably reduces the risk of cancer; and possibly prevents weight gain. 40 ▶ How many fruits and vegetables should you eat? A healthy target is five fist-sized servings of fruits and vegetables daily. (Generally, we recommend dividing that into three servings of veggies and two servings of fruit.) For bonus points, try to eat a variety of colors. The pigments in fruits and veggies come from various healthful nutrients (called phytochemicals or phytonutrients). Different colors mean different phytochemicals, giving you a diverse array of these beneficial compounds, which are likely responsible for a majority of the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. (Read more: What the colors of fruits and vegetables mean ) ▶ Are people eating enough fruits and vegetables? No. Americans only eat an average of 2.5 servings of produce (fruit and vegetables combined) per day. 41 Only 12.2 percent of people meet fruit intake recommendations, and less—9.3 percent—meet vegetable intake recommendations. A mere ten percent of Americans get a full five servings of fruits and vegetables combined per day. 42 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? There are likely diminishing returns to eating more than the above suggestions. In that massive study mentioned earlier that observed 1.8 million people, the life-extending benefits of fruits and veggies plateaued at five servings per day. 39 In other words, higher intake (beyond two servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables) was not associated with additional disease risk reduction. That said, there may be other benefits to eating more fruits and vegetables. For example, due to their fiber and water content, fruits and vegetables are filling yet low in calories, so they can support weight management—and they certainly aren’t going to harm your health. Protein is the most important macronutrient to get right, especially as we age. Plant protein in particular is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death from all causes. 43 44 45 In terms of animal proteins, the results are more mixed. (That said, research on protein intake and mortality is generally based on observational studies that don’t give us clear ideas about cause and effect.) Generally, minimally processed forms of fish, poultry, and low-fat dairy are the best animal protein sources. To minimize health risks such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, limit processed forms of red meat (like bacon, hot dogs, deli slices, and pepperoni sticks). Even un processed forms of red meat should likely be limited to about 18 oz (~4 to 5 palm-sized portions) or less per week. 46 47 48 Nonetheless, regardless of the source, getting sufficient protein—at least 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight—significantly reduces the risk for sarcopenia (muscle loss), frailty, and neuromuscular decline. 49 50 Protein is also vital for maintaining and building muscle, keeping bones and soft tissues healthy, supporting immunity, and more. It’s also the most satiating macronutrient, and thus helpful for fat loss and/or body recompositioning. ▶ How much protein should you eat? The current USDA recommendation for protein intake is at least 0.8 grams of protein per kg of body weight (0.35 g/lb). However, newer research suggests this is likely the absolute minimum amount, and only for relatively young sedentary individuals. A better minimum intake for most is likely 1.2 g/kg (0.55 g/lb, or about 3 to 5 palm-sized portions of protein-rich foods), especially for older adults, as they’re at greater risk of muscle loss. Protein intake for muscle growth and retention, and/or if performing resistance training or other vigorous exercise would be 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg (0.75-1 g/lb), or about 4 to 8 palm-sized portions of protein-rich foods. ▶ Are people eating enough protein? That depends on how “enough” is defined. Most adults eat at least 0.8 g/kg. However, up to 10 percent of young women and up to 46 percent of older adults don’t hit this mark. 51 And, as noted, that recommendation is probably conservative compared to the ideal intake. Protein is also especially critical for those on GLP-1 medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound) to help prevent the muscle loss they can lead to. Aiming for at least 1.2 g/kg is vital for this population, especially if they are also older. (Getting closer to 1.6 g/kg is even better, if possible.) ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Once you get up to 1.2 g/kg, not necessarily. That amount is likely adequate for most, especially sedentary folks. If you’re trying to build muscle and strength or recover from vigorous exercise, or are taking GLP-1 medication for fat loss, striving towards 1.6 g/kg would help you achieve that goal more easily. If you’re trying to maximize strength and muscle gains, and/or are doing lots of strenuous exercise, consuming 1.6-2.2 g/kg is optimal (with the highest end of that range maxing out all benefits). Supplements make up a large part of the discussion around aging, but in reality only play a small role when it comes to increasing health and longevity. Using supplements (like a multivitamin, or doctor recommended vitamin D or iron) to prevent or correct deficiencies can be helpful for overall health well-being. Then, there are other supplements that have reasonably strong track records and can help us meet nutritional needs (protein powder), improve performance (creatine), or potentially even slow aging (fish oil might slow biological aging by a small amount). 52 However, the buzziest, trendiest supplements are often less proven. For example, curcumin, spirulina, and ginger are often listed as supplements that might help with inflammation, a hallmark of aging. However, the research here is still early, and far from definitive. There are also even less substantiated supplements that might modify other aspects of aging (resveratrol, NAD+, NAC), but the evidence is either very minimal or only in animal models. Some supplements (especially herbal supplements) can even cause harm, like liver damage. 53 If you want to give supplements a try, check for high-quality third-party seals of approval from organizations such as NSF . Examine.com —an online database that provides independent research summaries and analyses on most popular supplements—is also an excellent resource to help you determine which supplements might actually be effective. Regardless, talk to your healthcare provider before taking supplements, particularly if you take other medication.  Research shows that men who get enough quality sleep live almost five years longer than men who don’t, and women who get enough live two and a half years longer. 54 Studies also show sleep is just as important for your heart health as exercise, whole foods, weight management, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. 55 Compared to 7 hours of sleep per day, a 1 hour decrease in sleep duration has been associated with an 11 percent increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a 9 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 56 Older adults who sleep less than 6 hours per night are at higher risk for dementia and cognitive decline than those who sleep 7 to 8 hours. 57 (Deep sleep helps clear beta-amyloid plaques and wash out toxins from our brain, thought to be partially responsible for dementia.) ▶ How much sleep should you get? Sleep experts agree that 7 to 9 hours a night on average—with at least 7 hours of sleep most nights of the week—is ideal for most. However, the exact ideal hours may vary person to person. Generally, the right amount of sleep for you is the amount that allows you to feel relatively refreshed shortly after waking up, and allows you to fall asleep relatively easily at bedtime, with relatively sustained energy throughout the day. ▶ Are people getting enough sleep? About a third of US adults don’t meet the recommended amount of 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. 58 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Not necessarily. It seems that 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night is ideal in terms of health outcomes. 56 Interestingly, longer sleep duration (over 9 hours per night on average) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality. 59 60 61 However, it’s not clear that these risks are caused by sleeping more. Just as likely, it may be other health problems (such as depression, sleep apnea, or heavy alcohol consumption) that lead to both longer sleep times and higher health risks. (Read more: Transform your sleep—The scientific way to energize your body, sharpen your mind, and stop hitting snooze ) When left unchecked for long periods of time (say, months or years without periods of recovery), stress can have negative effects on nearly every aspect of our health, as the below image shows.  Chronic stress—which tends to increase heart rate, blood pressure, and inflammation—increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. 62 63 64 Additionally, long-term stress tends to worsen mental and emotional health, increasing the risk of anxiety and depression. 65 It can also make people more likely to turn to substances like alcohol as an attempt to cope. 66 That said… Not all stress is bad. In fact, stress is a normal, natural, and even beneficial part of life; the right amount helps us feel motivated, purposeful, and engaged with life. So, rather than avoiding or demonizing stress, it’s helpful to work with it, using it as an opportunity to develop healthy coping mechanisms, appropriate recovery strategies, and overall resilience. And this doesn’t necessarily mean sitting on a cushion and meditating. Stress management can include simple mindset shifts: Practicing self-compassion, 67 having a growth mindset, 68 and framing stress as a normal and even beneficial part of life 69 have all been associated with better coping under stress. Basic self-regulation skills also help. This involves noticing and naming what you’re feeling, having good control over your actions, and using a broad range of coping skills to help yourself process emotions and recover from stress. With these skills, you build self-awareness and the ability to handle challenges better, because you know how to calm yourself down after an activating event—regardless of how it went. The below image offers a spectrum of more—small and big—ways to regulate stress.  ▶ How much stress management should you engage in? Think of stress management and recovery as a thing you do in proportion to the stress and demands of your life. We often use the analogy of a jug: When stress drains your tank, stress management and recovery practices help fill it back up again. And, as with all of the foundational health habits we’ve discussed, every little bit counts. Whether you’re experiencing a little or a lot of stress in your life, even three to five minutes of purposeful recovery—doing deep breathing exercises, some journaling or gentle stretching, or just stepping outside to get some fresh air and listen to the birds—can help fill your tank. ▶ Are people doing enough to manage stress? Probably not. In the US, over a quarter of people report that most days, they’re so stressed they can’t function. 70 In Canada, it’s similar: Just under a quarter of people say that most days in their life are either “quite a bit” or “extremely” stressful. 71 Additionally, over a third of people say they don’t know where to start when it comes to managing their stress. 72 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Not necessarily. The goal is to find your stress “sweet spot.” Because we all enjoy and tolerate different types and amounts of stress, how you feel is actually a pretty good indicator of whether stress is too low, too high, or “just right.” As the image below shows, if you generally feel bored and purposeless, stress is likely too low; if you feel energized and engaged, stress is probably close to your “sweet spot”; and if you feel panicky or so overwhelmed you’ve started to feel hopeless, stress is likely too high.  While having a routine for stress management is a smart idea, there’s likely a point of diminishing returns here too. If you’re in that stress “sweet spot” (energized/engaged, not bored and not overwhelmed), then adding more stress reduction techniques might not help further—and may actually add stress by giving you yet another task to do. You might not think of social connection as a health imperative, but it is. Not only is the social and emotional support associated with improved well-being, it’s also associated with reduced risk of premature death. 73 74 When relationships are strong, people have a 50 percent increased likelihood of survival during any given time. 75 In fact, one of the longest running studies—the Study of Adult Development out of Harvard Medical School, which has been tracking participants for over 87 years (and counting)— found that strong relationships were the biggest predictor of not only life satisfaction but longevity. (Relationships were more predictive of these outcomes than social class, wealth, IQ, or genetics.) 76 No surprise, not having a social circle comes with its own distinct risks. Social isolation and loneliness can increase a person’s risk for heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, depression and anxiety, suicidality and self-harm, dementia, and earlier death. 77 78 A frequently cited statistic highlights its profound impact: The effect of social isolation on mortality is comparable to smoking up to 15 cigarettes per day 79 —surpassing even the risks associated with obesity and physical inactivity. 80 ▶ Are people getting enough social connection? It seems many of us could use more friends. About 1 in 3 adults report feeling lonely, and 1 in 4 report not having social and emotional support. 77 Eight percent of adults say they have no close friends, 53 percent say they have between one and four close friends, and 38 percent report having five or more friends. 81 ▶ How much social connection should you aim for? Generally speaking, research finds that people who have three to five close friends they regularly interact with (one to three times per week, in-person or via phone call) get the most social benefit. 82 83 84 85 On average, interaction with a smaller group of people tends to provide more benefit than a large network of acquaintances. 86 That said, individual needs vary. If you feel authentically connected to others, have a strong sense of belonging, and generally feel socially fulfilled, that’s what matters most. ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Likely not. Some evidence suggests that excessive social engagement (daily or multiple times daily) actually might increase mortality risk. 87 That’s probably because over-socializing can increase mental, emotional, and physical fatigue, 88 and often this level of socialization includes alcohol or other potentially risky behaviors. Additionally, it can take away time and energy that could be put towards other life-building and health-promoting behaviors (like work, exercise, or sleep). The takeaway? Strive for socializing that brings value to your life. No need to add so much that you wind up exhausted, or unable to keep up with other priorities. Minimizing activities we know to be harmful is a key part of looking after your long-term health, yet it can be easy to overlook these things. (Maybe because we’d rather keep doing them.) Two of the biggest culprits are smoking and drinking alcohol. We all know smoking is bad for us. But smoking is still relatively common: The WHO estimates more than 8 million people die prematurely yearly from tobacco use (with an additional 56,000 people dying annually from chewing tobacco). 91 This makes tobacco a leading (i.e. top 3) risk factor for premature death and all-cause mortality. 92 Smoking is also a risk factor for several chronic conditions, including coronary heart disease, stroke, emphysema, and cancer. 93 (Globally, about a quarter of cancer deaths are attributed to smoking. 90 ) At this point, the research is pretty clear: Alcohol has negative implications for your health, especially past a certain point of regular use.  Alcohol plays a causal role in 200+ diseases, particularly liver diseases, heart diseases, at least seven types of cancers, depression, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, and dementia. 94 95 In 2019, 2.6 million deaths worldwide were attributable to alcohol consumption. 96 For people in the 15-49 age range, alcohol is the leading risk factor for death, with 3.8 percent of female deaths and 12.2 percent of male deaths attributable to alcohol use. 97 ▶ How much alcohol is “safe” to drink? US guidance on alcohol suggests keeping intake at moderate levels, or less. 98 A moderate intake means: Importantly, a drink is defined as containing 14 grams (about 0.6 fluid ounces) of pure ethanol, which equates to: ▶ Are people limiting their alcohol enough? In the US, people tend to drink more than the recommended guidelines. In 2021, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported that the average American aged 21 or older consumed 2.51 gallons of pure alcohol over the course of a year—equivalent to about 10 standard drinks/week. 99 However, research suggests surveys typically underestimate consumption by 40 to 50 percent. 100 Further, other research shows that the heavier a person drinks, the more significantly they’re likely to underestimate and/or underreport their drinking. 101 All that to say, the average American is likely having more (or even far more) than 10 drinks per week. Add to that: ▶ Is more abstinence from alcohol better? In 2023, the WHO released a statement saying no amount of alcohol is “safe.” 104 This interpretation is still debated, and data continues to emerge. Here’s our take: An abstinence-only policy is likely a failed policy for many. Rather, we want people to be informed so they can make intentional decisions. To be clear, alcohol is not beneficial for physical health; it’s a known human carcinogen. However, while alcohol does increase health risks, risk does not rise in a linear fashion with intake. Meaning, small doses are unlikely to have a significant impact on your health. But when you drink more heavily, the risks rise exponentially. 105 Drinking heavily can mean either: (Reminder: A single drink refers to those definitions mentioned previously. Pints of beer, and heavily poured wine glasses and cocktails are more than single servings… Just because it fits in a single glass doesn’t mean it counts as “one” drink.) Ultimately, it’s about finding the level of risk you’re willing to tolerate relative to whatever benefits you feel alcohol provides you. Our general recommendations: In all the chatter about longevity optimization, it can be easy to forget about all the boring—but no less important—things that help you stay safe and healthy throughout your life. These include things like: … And generally using common sense. (As in, avoid the “hold my beer” type stuff.) Basic health maintenance and risk avoidance practices matter—a lot. Notably, we can’t control every element of our environment. Some factors influencing our health are more structural and systemic, woven into the fabric of our societies. These are called social determinants of health , and include poverty, racism, homophobia, lack of accommodation for disabilities, and displacement (as in the case of refugees). For some folks, doing the above protective behaviors—like visiting the family doctor, getting glasses, going to the dentist, or even walking safely down the street—will be harder, sometimes near impossible. This isn’t meant to be a throwaway line that diminishes the difficult reality for so many people, but rather a gritty, realistic mantra: Do the best you can with what you’ve got. ▶ How much preventative health care do you need to do? Generally speaking, aim to be consistent with the habits you know you “should” do. You know the drill: Brush and floss daily; wear your helmet every time you ride a bike; wear your seatbelt every time you drive; put on sunscreen when you go out into the midday sun; don’t regularly blast your music at full volume; and so on. And if you have lingering things on your “I should really do that” list (like getting that weird mole checked out, or that bloodwork done), go do it. ▶ Are people practicing enough basic preventative health measures? We’ve offered a long-ish list of basic health practices that can protect health, so we won’t go into each in-depth. That said, when looking at the above list, it’s probably fair to say most people will notice a few behaviors they might practice more consistently. For example, while most of us are really consistent with our seat belts (usage is close to 92 percent! 116 ), many of us could break out the floss more often (only 32 percent of Americans floss daily 117 ). And, research shows that only about half of cyclists and motorcyclists wear helmets when riding 118 119 120 (and use is even lower among skateboarders and rollerbladers 121 ). Hearing loss is the number one modifiable risk factor for dementia, 122 so make sure you also follow the “60/60 rule” if you like to pump up the tunes on your headphones: Listen at 60 percent of your device’s maximum volume for 60 minutes, then take a break. (And wear earplugs when you mow the lawn!) ▶ Are more preventative measures better? Once again, there’s likely a law of diminishing returns when it comes to preventative health measures, just like everything else. The point isn’t to become obsessed with eliminating all possible risks at every turn. Rather, it’s that reasonable efforts towards protecting your health do count, and they‘re immeasurably more important for overall health than the latest optimization fads. Research consistently shows that having a strong sense of purpose and meaning for our life improves our health, overall well-being, and longevity too. 123 A sense of purpose seems to help people live longer, even when controlling for other markers of psychological well-being. There’s something uniquely beneficial about having a strong purpose that’s different from, say, being happy . Having a strong sense of purpose can mean many things, but it generally indicates that you have goals, and an aim in life. This purpose can be many things: Having purpose may help with longevity for a few reasons: It makes you more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as getting enough sleep and eating more fruits and vegetables. 123 It also tends to improve mental health. For example, one study showed that people with the strongest sense of purpose had a 43 percent reduced risk of depression. 123 Finally, it may simply help people live longer because it makes you want to live longer . When people have a sense of purpose, they often want to live longer, healthier lives, so they can fulfill that purpose to its fullest. And while wanting to live won’t make it so, it certainly doesn’t hurt.  We hope it’s clear by now: You can take yourself really far with some solid basics (that will themselves take some decent time and effort!). But, if you want to go even further, your effort might have to increase exponentially, just as those gains become less certain, and more marginal. Here’s what to keep in mind. Let’s compare the time and financial investment of two imaginary people. The first person is what you might call a “healthy” or “medium effort” person. They’re someone who is pretty consistently meeting all of the above recommendations. The second person is what you might call an “optimizer.” They do all the above recommendations, but to the max, and many of the fringe recommendations often discussed on health-related podcasts and books. How much time and money might each of these people invest in their health efforts on a weekly basis? Here’s what that might look like.  On top of that, there are “optimizing” behaviors and assessments that might be performed less often—say, monthly, seasonally, annually, or even every few years. Of course, these practices will still require time and money, so even though they’re less frequent, they still have to be accounted for. Here are some examples of those kinds of products, therapies, and tests: Though it’s hard to estimate the cost of these items, opting to do just a handful could easily cost an extra $10,000+ per year. Overall, we’d estimate it takes at least three to four times the time, effort, and money to follow an “optimizer” type lifestyle, compared to a plain old “healthy” lifestyle. As we’ve seen above, this 3-4x effort will likely translate to some extra benefits, but the medium-effort “healthy” lifestyle will likely get most people at least 80 percent of the results they’re after (such as improved lifespan, healthspan, and quality of life). The harder and more extreme someone’s fitness or health regime, the harder they typically fall off the wagon. So, taking on too much can actually put you more at risk of quitting the foundational health behaviors we mentioned earlier. Even if you stick with it, over-focusing on health and longevity will almost certainly interfere with your ability to enjoy a full, well-rounded, meaningful life. For example, if you get too focused on physical health, you may find other aspects of your deep health and overall wellbeing suffer, such as your relational, existential, mental, and emotional health.  Take this a step further, and “optimizing” can tip over into obsession. Sometimes, under the surface of “I just really care about my health” is disordered eating, orthorexia, or another mental health condition.  This, to us, is the heart of things: It’s important to not only stay relatively healthy, but also to enjoy your life while you’re living it. In fact, enjoying your life isn’t separate from good health. It’s part of it. Take a step back and consider what you really want most for yourself. What kind of life do you want to have? How important is it to maximize your healthspan and lifespan, and how does that line up with your other priorities? Given what you want most for yourself, and the resources you have available, what’s realistic for you? How much time, money, and effort are you willing to put in to achieve health and lifespan goals? What are you prepared to give up? What aren’t you prepared to give up? Review the foundational health behaviors in this article. How many of them are you already doing? Consistently? If you’re covering most of the basics, you might not need to do more. (Give yourself a pat on the back. You’re already elite!) Or, maybe there’s some room for improvement and you’d like to step it up a bit. Great! For the vast majority of people, improving any of these behaviors will deliver real, tangible results. Start with these, before chasing faddish, fringe, “super-optimal” stuff. Those people you hear on podcasts or social media aren’t the experts on you and your life. You get to decide what you want, and how to go about getting it. Be honest with yourself, and make choices aligned with what matters most to you.

Vegetable oil vs. olive oil vs. butter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare From TikTok to bestseller lists, vegetable oils—a.k.a. “seed oils”—are a big topic right now. To be fair, folks have debated the merits of vegetable oils dating back to when they first entered the marketplace. More recently, however, with the advent of the carnivore diet , vegetable oil hate has roared back into the socials. Maybe you’ve come across posts that refer to these cooking oils as “toxic sludge,” “motor oil,” “the hateful eight,” and “the biggest cause of chronic disease that nobody knows about.” The anti-vegetable oil logic goes something like this… Animal fats have been with humans for thousands of years. Vegetable fats, on the other hand, were invented during the last century when profit-seeking companies wanted to find a way to sell cheap-to-grow foods to unsuspecting consumers. Another argument: Like margarine, vegetable oils were marketed as healthier alternatives for butter, and yet, people argue, these oils are worse than butter, raising your risk for obesity, anxiety, depression, ulcerative colitis, and more. In contrast to the above line of thought, other experts will tell you that vegetable oils are harmless, potentially even health-promoting—and absolutely better than butter. So, who’s right? Like so many nutrition topics, the truth is too nuanced to fit on a meme. In this story, we’ll help you sort the science from the pseudoscience so you can make informed decisions about the oils you choose to include in your diet. Sometimes called “seed oils,” vegetable oils start, as you might suspect, from the seed of a plant. The most common ones you’ll find in a typical grocery aisle include: By the way, if you feel like there’s a bunch of oils missing from that list, it’s probably because those oils come from non-seed plants (such as olive, avocado, palm, or coconut oil, which all come from fruits, and aren’t considered vegetable or seed oils). Non-vegetable oils—such as olive and avocado oil—are derived from naturally fatty foods. In fact, olives are so oily that you could theoretically make your own olive oil at home. (Just Google “how to make olive oil from scratch,” and you’ll find a number of videos walking you through the steps.) The same can’t be said of most vegetable oils, which mostly come from foods with a relatively tiny fat content to begin with. Case in point: A cup of green olives contains about 20 grams of fat, 1 whereas a cup of corn has 2 grams. 2 As a result, manufacturers must use an extensive multi-step process to extract this small amount of oil from these non-oily foods. These steps include: During this process, health-promoting polyphenols and other stabilizing nutrients are lost, and small amounts of unsaturated fats are transformed into trans fatty acids (also called partially hydrogenated fat). (Interesting fact: This also happens during deep frying. When vegetable oils sizzle in a restaurant’s deep fryer for hours, the trans fat content of the oil increases.) To call these processed oils “toxic” might be an exaggeration. However, nutrition scientists generally agree that people should avoid trans fats in the diet, and in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration banned manufacturers from adding trans fats to processed foods. 3 4 At PN, we’ve created several visual guides people can use to make informed decisions about what to eat. (We’ve also created a shopping list, which you or your clients can print out and take to the grocery store. Check it out: Healthy Fats Shopping List ) In these guides, we’ve placed a few vegetable oils—expeller-pressed canola oil, high-oleic sunflower, and safflower oils—in the “Eat Some” section. For us, “eat some” is another way of saying that these foods will neither improve health nor harm health—when consumed in reasonable amounts. In some cases, like in the example of dark chocolate, when consumed in small amounts, they might even improve health. The rest of the vegetable oils, along with butter and other saturated fats, fall into the “Eat Less” category, as the image below shows. You’ll find vegetable oils in bold.  We’ve gotten hate mail from folks who say certain vegetable oils—especially cold-pressed canola oil—should appear alongside olive oil in the “eat more” category. Plenty of others say all vegetable oils belong in the “eat less” column, and that butter belongs in “eat some” or even “eat more.” To understand the scientific reasoning behind our recommendations, let’s explore some head-to-head matchups. These oils are the least refined of their kind. To make extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), manufacturers grind and mechanically press olives, without using any heat. Similarly, expeller-pressed canola oil is made by mechanically pressing rapeseed, without the use of heat or chemical solvents. Olive oil is richer in heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) than almost any other cooking oil. In addition, unlike the more refined “light” olive oil, EVOO maintains most of the olive fruit’s original polyphenols. These plant-based substances help to combat inflammation and protect cells from damage. Perhaps most importantly… More studies vouch for EVOO’s health-promoting qualities than for any other cooking fat. For example, researchers asked 22,892 adults from Southern Italy to self-report their olive oil consumption. People who consumed the most olive oil (more than two tablespoons a day) were 20 percent less likely to die over the 13-year study than people who consumed the least olive oil (less than one tablespoon a day). 5 Other research has linked the consumption of olive oil with a reduced risk of: Consumption of olive oil is also associated with reductions in LDL cholesterol, especially when used to replace saturated fats like butter and coconut oil. 10 Years ago, culinary experts recommended using EVOO only on salads and other uncooked foods. Back then, they assumed EVOO’s relatively low smoke point (350 to 410F) meant the oil would break down when heated, losing some of its distinctive flavor and health benefits. We now know that smoke point isn’t as big a deal as previously thought. That’s especially true in the case of EVOO, whose polyphenols and high concentrations of monounsaturated fats help keep the oil stable when heated. In research that heated a variety of cooking oils to 464 F (240C) and then held them at 356 F (180C) for several hours, EVOO remained more stable than any other oil tested, including canola oil. 11  One of the more affordable cooking oils on the shelf, canola oil, is made from a Canadian-made hybrid of the rapeseed plant. (The word “canola” refers to the first three letters of “Canada” with a fun “ola” added to the end for marketing purposes.) 12 Among vegetable oils, canola is the richest in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (though several non-vegetable oils have it beat) as well as alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. In addition, canola oil contains plant substances called phytosterols that help influence blood cholesterol for the better, especially when used as a substitute for butter, research has found. 13 14 15 Extra virgin olive oil is the clear winner. The body of research in support of EVOO dwarfs the body of research in support of expeller-pressed canola. In addition, EVOO has a more favorable fatty acid profile. By the way, so does avocado oil, which is why you’ll also find it in the “eat more” column. However, you can buy roughly twice as much expeller-pressed canola oil for half as much money as EVOO. Because of this, expeller-pressed canola can be a good budget-friendly choice. In addition, because of expeller-pressed canola’s more neutral flavor, many people prefer it over EVOO for baking. When used in moderation, expeller-pressed canola can be part of a healthy diet. It is likely to be at least health neutral, if not somewhat health beneficial. This match-up comes down to how processing methods affect the end product. An expeller press is a machine that squeezes oil out of seeds. It’s able to do this without the use of solvents or heat, which helps preserve beneficial compounds such as alpha-linolenic acid and phytosterols. Refining removes some protective alpha-linoleic acid while adding small amounts of unhealthy trans fatty acids. This results in a product that is proportionally lower in omega-3 fatty acids and higher in omega-6 fatty acids. Expeller-pressed canola oil wins, but only by a small margin. That’s because canola oil starts with a less controversial fatty acid profile than many other vegetable oils, as the chart below shows. Soybean oil, for example, has less heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and much more theoretically inflammation-contributing omega-6 fat.  The typical American consumes around 16 to 20 times more omega-6 fats than omega-3s. This imbalance could theoretically increase inflammation in your body, potentially raising your risk for diabetes, obesity, and other health problems, argue some experts. 16 Years ago, the recommendation to balance your omega 6s with omega 3s was widespread. (The suggested “ideal” ratio: Anywhere from 1:1 to 4:1, in favor of omega 6s.) These days, there’s more debate among nutritional scientists as to whether this imbalance contributes to chronic inflammation, especially when those omega 6s are consumed in whole foods that contain many other beneficial compounds. For example, nuts and seeds—both naturally rich in omega-6 fats—have been associated with a range of health benefits , including reductions in blood cholesterol and inflammation. 17 18 In 2019, Harvard Health ran the headline “ No need to avoid healthy omega-6 fats .” In support of their argument, a 2019 study from the American Heart Association journal Circulation determined that, if anything, the consumption of omega-6 fats reduced the risk for stroke, heart disease, and early death. 19 However, while nuts and refined canola oil may share a somewhat similar fatty acid profile, the two foods differ in one important way. As we mentioned earlier, refined canola oil is basically pure oil. Meanwhile, nuts and seeds come packaged with health-protective fiber, polyphenols, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Minimally-processed foods, like nuts or extra virgin oils, include a complex matrix of health-promoting nutrients. Highly-processed oils, on the other hand, have lost the vast majority of those healthful compounds, leaving mostly just the fatty acids which are more prone to oxidation (we’ll cover that next).  This is the match-up that triggers the most arguing on the interwebs. Let’s cover the major claims from both sides—plus what the research says. Butter proponents argue that saturated fats have been unnecessarily vilified. They point to nutrition recommendations during the 1980s and 1990s that recommended people replace butter with trans-fat rich margarine. (We all know how that went.) Margarine aside, others claim the research in support of reducing saturated fats is thin at best. 20 However, excessive saturated fat consumption (beyond 10 percent of total calories) does seem to boost cholesterol levels and may increase your risk of heart disease. 21 Some research has found that replacing 5 percent of the saturated fats in your diet with monounsaturated fats could reduce the risk of heart disease by 15 percent. Similarly, replacing 5 percent of the saturated fats in your diet with polyunsaturated fats (with most of that coming from refined vegetable oils) reduces the risk of a future heart attack by 10 percent, according to an analysis of eight studies involving 13,614 people. 22 Many other studies support this finding. 23 But not all saturated fats affect blood cholesterol equally. In some dairy foods, a membrane—called a milk fat globule membrane —surrounds the saturated fats and seems to limit their cholesterol-raising properties. However, butter is low in this protective membrane, and consequently raises blood cholesterol more than other high-fat dairy products, like full-fat milk, cream, yogurt, or cheese. 24 25 26 The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend capping saturated fat at less than 10 percent of your calorie intake. A tablespoon of butter contains 7 grams of saturated fat—a third of the recommended daily limit in a 2000 Calorie diet. So, while you don’t necessarily need to eliminate butter, it’s worth moderating your intake. (Interested in learning about all the nuances of saturated fat consumption? Read: Is saturated fat good or bad for you? ) Due to their chemical structure, polyunsaturated fats are inherently less stable and more prone to oxidation than saturated or monounsaturated fats. During the refining process, protective phytochemicals and antioxidants are stripped, making these oils more prone to oxidation. The theory is that this oxidation increases inflammation in the body and elevates the risk of various health conditions. There’s some evidence to suggest that diets rich in polyunsaturated fats, especially from refined vegetable oils, are associated with increased levels of oxidized blood lipids, lipid peroxidation, and other markers of inflammation. 27 28 If you only use refined corn or safflower oils to lightly coat veggies before roasting them, you likely don’t have much to worry about. However, for the vast majority of people, the biggest source of refined vegetable oils isn’t home-cooked meals—it’s ultra-processed foods. The extra processing and repeated heat exposure used to create ultra-processed foods further oxidize these oils. Additionally, these foods are often loaded with potentially harmful ingredients like added sodium and sugars, and low in beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Plus, they’re incredibly calorie-dense and difficult to stop eating, which can raise your risk for obesity. (Find out exactly why highly-processed foods are so “addictive”: Why you can’t stop eating ultra-processed foods .) Most ultra-processed foods list one or more vegetable oils as one of their ingredients. Even ultra-processed foods that you wouldn’t think of as “fatty” contain small amounts. You’ll find them in store-bought cookies, chips, crackers, sauces, frozen dinners, meal replacement shakes, boxed macaroni and cheese, salad dressing, boxed rice blends, and more. In a large review involving nearly 10 million people, the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher risk of premature death. 29 In addition, studies have linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods with the following health problems: 30 31 32 33 You don’t have to abolish ultra-processed foods. But your health will benefit from capping your consumption to about 20 percent or so of your intake, with the other 80 percent or so from mostly minimally-processed whole foods. This alone will naturally lower your refined vegetable oil intake to a safer level, without much fuss. Plus, consuming refined vegetable oils in the context of a diet that’s rich in colorful plants, fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants may help offset the concern of oxidation. (For example, by putting a reasonable amount of commercial salad dressing on a large, colorful salad.) This match-up is a draw. Ultimately, both should be limited in the diet, and neither are health- promoting. Most refined vegetable oils are lopsidedly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to monounsaturated fats, and are stripped of many protective compounds. As mentioned earlier, some experts argue that these omega-6-rich fats may contribute to inflammation (but the evidence here is mixed). Because of how they’re processed, seed oils also contain some of those trans fats that everyone agrees we should all minimize. In contrast, butter is low in omega 6s but high in saturated fat, which can be problematic in higher amounts. Especially since it’s so low in the protective milk fat globule membrane. However, compared to refined vegetable oil, butter is less processed. Like olive oil, it’s one of those fats you could theoretically make at home. This might be obvious from the head-to-head matchups, but we’ll say it anyway. If you like it and can afford it, EVOO is a great choice. Cold-pressed avocado oil and walnut oil are also great options, as both are rich in antioxidant compounds. Like EVOO, avocado oil is a rich source of MUFAs. Walnut oil’s fat primarily comes from polyunsaturated fats, so it’s best used as a dressing rather than used for cooking (as it’s less heat stable). However, like EVOO, avocado and walnut oil tend to be expensive. If you or your client are budget-conscious, expeller-pressed canola oil is a solid runner-up. Similarly, high-oleic sunflower and safflower oils are richer sources of monounsaturated fats than their high-linoleic cousins. When substituted for saturated fats like butter, high-oleic oils have been associated with cardiovascular benefits. 34 35 Regardless of what cooking fats you or your client choose, you’ll also want to do the following: Whole and minimally-processed foods—such as nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, and salmon—are more likely to feature health-promoting monounsaturated (MUFAs) and omega-3 fats. They also come packaged with a wide array of other good-for-you nutrients such as fiber, protein, minerals, and antioxidants. In contrast, ultra-professed foods are generally devoid of everything you keep hearing you should consume more of. These foods also tend to be calorie-dense, highly rewarding, and hard to stop eating. If you’re not sure whether packaged food is minimally processed or highly processed, take a close look and consider: If you answer “no” to most of the above, the food is likely highly processed. It doesn’t matter what source of fat is used to fry them. Sort all fried foods into the “eat less” category. EVOO is associated with longer, healthier lives. However, that doesn’t mean you should be doing shots of it. As a general rule, you’re better off getting most of your fat from foods like avocados, olives, nuts and seeds than from any cooking oil. Whole food fats are rich in fiber, phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals, and are generally less calorie-dense than oils. (But having one to three servings of oils or butter per day is reasonable.)

In the best cases, these devices offer a bridge between what you subjectively feel and what you can objectively measure. This is generally a really cool and amazing thing. Our subjective feelings and assessments matter, but they’re not always the most reliable. Us humans just aren’t particularly skilled at quantifying our experiences and behaviors with cold precision. Take, for example, a colleague of mine. He believed he was eating within a narrow caloric window, but after careful tracking, he learned that he was putting away a bonus 500 Calories a day—in barbecue sauce. That said, some of us are better than others. Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter, was reported to have been able to call out his 100 metre time within a tenth of a second of the stopwatch readout. 1 That’s outlier performance, to be clear, but it still makes you wonder: And, how can you improve your accuracy through the wise use of technology—like fitness trackers—to help you make better decisions about your health? In the following article, we’ll tackle the above, plus we’ll address: Let’s get into it. Not all data is created equal. Some brands produce better products than others. This is not just hardware but also the quality of their software and datasets. Beyond that, not all things are equally easy to quantity. For example, heart rate and step-count data are generally reliable, 2 but many other types of outputs—from calories burned to movement velocity—have substantial margins for error. The below chart shows the reliability of various tracking devices. (If you’re curious, we cover the accuracy of various progress indicators in more detail here: Are Fitness Trackers Worth It? ) The good: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. The bad: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. “What’s really remarkable,” says Samantha Kleinberg, a computer scientist who studies decision-making, “is that even a tiny amount of surplus information has a big negative effect on our decision-making.” 3 That’s the paradox of tracking: Too little detail makes it tough to make the right decision, but so does too much. This can be expressed as an inverted U, with the sweet spot at the top of the curve. Consider the analysis paralysis you feel after scanning hundreds of reviews from the various taco places in your neighborhood. (All you wanted was a decent el pastor, but now you don’t know which taqueria to pick!) Finding just enough information to make good decisions is an art form—especially in the world of health and fitness, where it seems like everyone is trying to outdo each other when it comes to providing more science, more customization, and more complexity. But when all that information starts to blur together with no clear path forward, what should you do? For starters, you can ask yourself a simple question: Does tracking increase my wellbeing and performance? If the answer is a clear yes or no, you know what to do. (Either continue tracking as you were, or drop the gadget and walk away.) If you’re a little fuzzy, here are three signs to watch for to help you determine if tracking is helpful—or not. When Zak’s coach raved about the benefits of zone 2 cardio, it sounded logical. But when the rubber on his running shoes hit the road, Zak second-guessed everything. Zak prided himself on his ability to grind, and simply didn’t trust that something that felt easy could also be effective. Yet, the data didn’t lie. As the weeks went by, Zak watched his resting heart rate drop—along with his recovery time from hard runs. With that reassurance, Zak began to relax about the process—and his resting heart rate dropped further. Zak hadn’t trusted his feelings, but he did trust the data from his heart rate monitor. Using a tracking device enabled Zak to calibrate his own perceptions so they were more accurate and realistic. If you’re a coach who has a client like Zak who’s high performing but doesn’t know it, tracking can help build confidence and reduce the anxiety that they’re “not good enough.” Here, you empower them by shining a spotlight on existing performance. Expert assurance can go a long way but can also be bolstered by reliable data. (Recently, many people have begun using continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, in order to “optimize” their blood sugar levels. This can help “validate” certain food choices… but it can also be a waste of time. Read more: Should people without diabetes use CGMs? ) Sometimes, data can stress you out without any upside—like when you receive poor scores about things beyond your control. Take the new parent of a newborn who gets a poor sleep quality score. Tracking has a time and a place. When scores are beyond your control or your priorities lie elsewhere, tracking can create unnecessary stress and is counterproductive. You can always revisit tracking when circumstances or priorities change. For a behaviour to take place, you need three things 4 : Fitness trackers shine when you’ve got plenty of motivation and ability—and just lack the prompt. Take my client, Margaret. She used to have a glass of wine most nights, believing it helped her sleep better. Once she started wearing a sleep tracker though, she saw that her sleep quality was much poorer the nights she imbibed. Once she received this prompt—her sleep score—she adjusted her behavior. When you highlight important data, the right choices become clearer. When it comes to changing behaviours, sometimes all it takes is one key piece of data. As they say, “Once you see it, you can’t un-see it.” (PN’s CEO Tim Jones used the feedback he got from various lifestyle trackers to finally reduce his genetically high cholesterol levels—and built a richer, more meaningful life in the process. Read more: How This Guy Cut His Cholesterol in Half Without Drugs ) When Jan, an avid recreational cyclist, found out he could view—then demolish—the records set on local biking trails, he set to work. But as those records were destroyed, so too was his ability to ride for enjoyment. His focus on speed left him under-recovered and eventually led to burnout. If workouts have become more about the numbers and less about technique, experience, or even enjoyment, tracking is likely no longer helpful. The harder you work, the better your results. Right? Not necessarily. This belief tends to get grinders like Zak into trouble because they think they’re making progress—but really they’re just getting in their own way, even inhibiting performance and recovery. Meanwhile, there are also many people who chronically under estimate their effort and capacity, and would benefit from turning up the heat. Here, data can help us more accurately understand our own potential. Let’s look at high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an example. HIIT workouts alternate fixed periods of intense effort with fixed periods of rest. However, these fixed periods of rest are just estimates of recovery times. Heart rate data can create a more individualized picture of actual recovery needs, which may be faster or slower than you expect. Sometimes, the mind says yes but the heart says not quite yet. A good coach does more than just simply ask for more . They also help keep clients out of the unproductive “junk volume” zone, where fatigue accumulates but performance doesn’t improve (and maybe even worsens). By looking at real-time metrics of output, fatigue, and recovery, you can better understand yourself and your clients, and help keep everyone training and recovering efficiently. When you become overly reliant on data, you risk losing touch with your own sense of how you feel, whether that’s hunger and fullness levels, energy and fatigue, or something else. A relevant example is “The Great My Fitness Pal Blackout.” In January of 2019, the calorie-tracking app (with a reported 200 million subscribers!) went down for a day. Pretty minor—unless you happened to be tracking your macro and caloric intake and waiting for the app to tell you exactly how much you could eat that day… which I was. When the app wouldn’t load, I recognized the mild panic I felt was unhelpful. My overreliance on the app had disconnected me from my own internal signals, and without it, I felt adrift. Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to how energetic I feel and one of the oldest tracking technologies available: the mirror. (If you feel like you’re lost without your besties—your phone and your apps—there’s a name for that. There are also ways to develop a healthier relationship with your tech. Read more: What is nomophobia? ) Before we get to how to do the above, let’s talk about why assessing things by feel can be so important. Whether it’s body fat percentage or movement speed, even supremely motivated and capable clients will experience diminishing objective results from their training. The scale stops dropping, the number of plates you’re able to load on the bar plateaus, or— gasp —your race time even regresses. Motivation based purely on progress or other extrinsic goals 6 will fall away during these times. However, exercisers who focus on feelings of mindfulness 7 , mastery, meaning 8 , and success 9 develop a more resilient practice. They also enjoy the process more, whether that’s the process of running, lifting, winding down for a good night’s sleep, or just enjoying a meal. So, although objective data can provide essential feedback and guidance, you’ll only reap the full benefits of your practice—that is, enjoyment and results—if you maintain connection with your felt experience. And good news: You can actually use fitness trackers to calibrate and even improve your ability to accurately sense what’s happening in your body. Here are three ways to do it. Can you imagine asking someone how their vacation was and then waiting for them to look at their photos to be able to answer? That’s what it’s like when you rely purely on external data about your own experience. Whatever the metric—how far you biked, how many calories you consumed, or how fast your heart was beating—the simplest way to work mindfully with tracker data is to pause, breathe, and then tune into the powerful (if not always accurate) prediction-making powers of your brain. Once you’ve checked in with yourself, you can calibrate your self-assessment by comparing the detailed (if not always accurate) outputs of your fitness tracker. Over time, you may be able to narrow the gap between two. (Note: Don’t forget to regularly update your app. Algorithms and data sets are regularly adjusted for better predictive accuracy.) The coaches I work with regularly ask people to estimate the boundaries of their strength (such as how many reps they can do at a given weight until failure). Novices are often terrible at estimating this—and regularly off the mark by five or more reps. However, the use of objective trackers can help calibrate their understanding, and most people can reduce their margin of error dramatically. In theory, you might use fancy tools like accelerometers or blood lactate measurements, but our coaches just ask, “For a million dollars a rep, how many more reps do you think you could do?” Though there’s nothing objective about this question, most clients are able to use the prompt as a kind of shortcut to understand maximal effort. (After all, that last rep may be worth seven figures!) The question also leverages the rate of perceived exertion (RPE)—your perception of how hard you’re working—which is one of the most validated sensory-driven approaches. Not everyone is automatically good at estimating RPE, but most people can improve their skills by mapping their felt experience with occasional calibration with objective data. Trackers have components like accelerometers, GPS, and gyroscopes to sense data about speed, distance, and more. But humans are no slouches either. We have… And that’s only a partial list. You have access to an incredibly rich network of sensory information—something that technology cannot begin to touch. All of this information is fed into the powerful pattern-recognition machine of your nervous system. To continue honing your ability to use this rich network of sensory information, regularly check in with what and how you’re feeling. When you learn to calibrate your own senses with objective data, you can leverage all the cool advances in wearable tech—while still keeping your own experience front and centre.

Here are four steps to freedom.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-stop-tracking-macros\">How to stop tracking macros and trust yourself around food</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare After years of careful macro tracking, Dr. Fundaro finally admitted to herself that the method no longer worked for her. Yet she was afraid to give it up. If anyone should feel confident in their food choices, it would be Dr. Gabrielle Fundaro. After all, Dr. Fundaro has a PhD in Human Nutrition, a decade-plus of nutrition coaching experience, and six powerlifting competitions under her belt. Yet, when she was really honest with herself, Dr. Fundaro realized that she felt far from confident around food. For years, she’d used macro counting as a way to stay “on track” with her eating. And it worked… until it didn’t. After years of macro tracking, Dr. Fundaro was tired of the whole thing. She was tired of making sure her macros were perfectly in balance. She was sick of not being able to just pick whatever she wanted off a menu and enjoy the meal, trusting that her health and physique wouldn’t go sideways as a result. Yet the idea of not tracking freaked her out. Every time she quit tracking, she worried: “What if I don’t eat enough protein, and lose all my muscle?” “What if I overeat and gain fat?” “What if I have no idea how to fuel myself without tracking macros? And what does that say about me as an expert in the field of nutrition?” Something that would support her nutritional goals while also giving her a sense of freedom and peace around food. Calorie counting wouldn’t do it. That was just as restrictive as counting macros—maybe more. Intuitive eating didn’t seem like a good fit either. Intuitive eating relies heavily on a person’s ability to tune into internal hunger and fullness cues to guide food choices and amounts. After years of relying on external cues (like her macro targets), Dr. Fundaro didn’t feel trusting enough of her own instincts; she wanted more structure. Meanwhile, at the gym, Dr. Fundaro began lifting based on the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale—a framework that helps individuals quantify the amount of effort they’re putting into a given movement or activity. It’s considered a valuable tool to help people train safely and effectively according to their ability and goals. (More on that soon.) While using the RPE scale in her training, Dr. Fundaro found she was both getting stronger and recovering better. There was something to this combination of structure and intuition that just worked. And then, it dawned on Dr. Fundaro like the apple hit Sir Isaac Newton on the head: With that, the RPE-Eating Scale was born. Dr. Fundaro has since used this alternative method to help herself and her clients regain confidence and self-trust around food; improve nutritional awareness and competence; and free themselves from food tracking . (Yup, Dr. Fundaro finally trusts her eating choices—no macro tracker in sight.) In this article, you’ll learn how she did it, plus : Invented by Gunnar Borg in the 1960’s, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a scale that’s used to measure an individual’s perceived level of effort or exertion during exercise. Though Borg’s RPE uses a scale that goes from 6 to 20, many modern scales use a 0 to 10 range (which is the range that Dr. Fundaro adapted for her RPE-Eating scale). Here’s the RPE scale used in fitness. Originally used in physiotherapy settings, the scale is now frequently used in fitness training. For example, powerlifters might use it to choose how heavy they want to go during a training session. Or, pregnant women might use it to ensure they aren’t over-exerting themselves during a fitness class or strength training session. Because human experience is highly subjective and individual, the scale allows the exerciser to judge how hard they’re working for themselves. A coach can provide a general guideline, such as “aim for a 7/10 this set,” but it’s up to the client to determine exactly what that means for them. Dr. Fundaro had used the scale many times with herself, and clients. She always appreciated the sense of autonomy it gave her clients, while still providing some structure. So, she decided to take the same 1-10 scale and its principles, and apply it to eating.  The goal with RPE-Eating is similar to RPE when training: Develop the skills to determine what is sufficient for you , without having to rely on other external metrics (such as apps or trackers). If you’ve ever practiced RPE-training, you’ll know it takes some time to get used to. RPE-Eating is the same. Don’t expect to be in lockstep with all of your body’s internal cues at first, especially if you’ve been ignoring them for a long time. With this in mind, apply the steps below to practice the RPE-Eating process. RPE-Eating is not just another diet. “It’s not about aiming to change your body,” Dr. Fundaro explains. “It’s not about feeling more control over your diet. Nor is it about feeling like you’re eating the ‘optimal’ diet.” If your priority is maintaining a specific physique (such as staying ultra lean) or changing your body (building muscle or losing fat), this method can be adapted for that, though it isn’t the most efficient one to use. Instead, RPE-Eating is about sensing into what your body needs and giving yourself appropriate nourishment—while building inner trust and confidence along the way. “You have to trust that you’ll be able to nourish your body, and that you’ll be okay even though things may change in your body,” says Dr. Fundaro. Admittedly, this can be challenging to do. It can also be difficult to let go of the expectation that you’ll hit the “right” macros at every meal—which RPE-Eating isn’t specifically designed to do. However, if your goal is to build more self-trust, RPE-Eating can be a great tool to help you do that. Before we explore this step, let’s distinguish between two motivators for eating. First, there’s hunger . Hunger occurs when physical cues in your body (like a general sense of emptiness or rumbling in your stomach, or lightheadedness) tells you that you require energy—known to us mortals as food. Then, there’s appetite. Appetite is our desire or interest in eating. It can stay peaked even after hunger is quelled, especially if something looks or tastes especially delicious—like a warm, gooey cookie offered after dinner that you feel you have to try, even though you’re technically full. While it’s normal to eat for both hunger and appetite drives, the two can become mixed up. Especially if we have a history of dieting and tracking food. The RPE-Eating scale helps you tap back into those true physical hunger cues, and learn the difference between hunger and appetite. To put this in practice, try this before your next meal: ▶ Using the RPE-Eating scale mentioned above , identify your current level of hunger. Record the number on paper or the notes app on your phone. ▶ Then, eat your meal with as much presence as possible. (Note: This in itself takes practice. It can help to limit distractions, such as eating at the table rather than in front of the TV, and focusing on the flavors and textures of the food you’re eating, and how you feel eating it.) ▶ About halfway through the meal, check in again. Based on the scale, how hungry are you now? As before, record the number. ▶ If you’re still hungry, finish your meal. When you’re finished, repeat the same process, writing down where you are on the scale. ▶ Once you’re done, take a minute and tune into what your body feels like. What does it feel like to be full? “Download” that feeling into your mind and internalize it in your body, as if you’re updating your phone with the latest software. Repeat this for as many meals as you can. Aim to do it for one meal a day for a week or so, or for as long as feels good to you. Don’t worry if you forget: simply repeat the practice when you can. The more you practice this, the better you’ll become at being attuned with your actual hunger cues. With time, you’ll likely find you develop more trust in your internal compass than what the latest diet tracker says for your needs. (For more on fully-tuned-in, mindful eating, read: The benefits of slow eating .) Have you ever come home after a super stressful day and you’ve basically thrown yourself onto a bag of chips or a carton of ice cream? We might like to imagine ourselves eating every meal mindfully, using the RPE- Eating system to a tee, but life rarely works like that. Chances are, there are certain situations that trigger you to eat more quickly, mindlessly, and beyond the point of hunger. That’s okay. Dr. Fundaro’s suggestion? Aim to become more aware of the situations that cause you to overeat in the first place. To do this, you can practice something we use in PN Coaching: Notice and name. When you find yourself scarfing down food faster than you can blink, simply try to notice what’s going on. Can you name a feeling—such as anxiety, or sadness? Can you identify a situation or moment that happened before you started eating—say, an argument with your teenager, or a nasty email from your boss? Once you’ve identified the feeling, event, or person that’s triggered you to eat compulsively, see if you can also identify what you might really be needing or desiring. Eating for comfort is normal. However, if it’s the only coping method we have, it can cause more problems than it solves in the long run. When you find yourself with an urge to eat mindlessly, consider what non-food coping mechanisms might help you feel better. That could be 10 minutes away from your computer to close your eyes and breathe, a walk outside, or a quick call to a friend to rant—or just talk about something completely unrelated. Getting to know your non-hunger eating triggers—plus widening your repertoire of self-soothing methods—is just as valuable as getting to know your hunger cues. Over time, this awareness will allow you to eat with more intention. Even when you’re “adequately fueled” from a physical perspective, you might still feel unsatisfied from an emotional perspective. That’s because, according to the RPE-Eating framework, eating should fulfill two criteria: ▶ Satiety describes the physical sensation of being full; your calorie or fuel needs are met. ▶ Satisfaction describes a more holistic feeling of being nourished; your calorie needs are met, but your meal also felt pleasurable . If you ate to satiety only, your calorie needs might be met and your physical hunger quelled, but you might still feel unsatisfied—maybe because chocolate is on your “don’t” list, and even though you’ve eaten everything else in your kitchen that isn’t chocolate, nothing quite “hit the spot.” In other words, you can eat to satiety at every meal, yet still be “restricting” foods. You may not be restricting calories per se, but you may have banned entire food groups—baked goods, pizza, or whatever else curls your toes. This can lead to a feeling of constantly needing to police yourself, and doesn’t leave much room for the flexibility and spontaneity that real-life (enjoyable) eating requires. (Plus, avoiding particular foods tends to work like a pendulum: restrict now; binge later. If you want to learn how to stop those wild swings, read: How to eat junk food: A guide for conflicted humans ) Satisfaction is a key part of eating. After all, humans don’t just eat for adequate nutrients and energy. We eat for other reasons too: pleasure, novelty, tradition, community, enjoyment. So, to take your RPE-Eating to the next level, Dr. Fundaro recommends trying it with meals and foods you genuinely enjoy. If any foods or meals have been “off-limits,” try eating them using the RPE technique. (Macaroni and cheese, anyone?) Practice using the scale with a variety of meals (including those you may have restricted previously), and notice how you feel over time. With experience, you’ll get to know what it feels like to adequately fuel yourself with a variety of foods—including those you genuinely enjoy. RPE-Eating isn’t for everyone, but might be a good fit for you (or your clients) if: ✅ You feel dependent on food tracking, but you don’t want to be. ✅ Every time you stop tracking, the loss of perceived control freaks you out and drives you right back to tracking. ✅ You want to stop tracking, but you want to have some type of system or guidance in place. ✅ You’re currently tracking (or considering tracking) your food intake, and you have elevated risk factors for developing an eating disorder such as high body dissatisfaction; a history of yo-yo dieting; a history of disordered eating patterns; and/or participation in weight class sports. If you’re a coach looking to use this tool with a client, check out Dr. Fundaro’s resources . Remember this tool may not be for everyone, and how you apply it needs to be flexible. Note: If you or your client struggles with disordered eating, this tool does not replace working with a health professional who specializes in eating disorders, such as a therapist, doctor, or registered dietician.  According to Dr. Fundaro, the best way to use RPE-Eating is in a weight-neutral setting. While it could be used for weight modification, she doesn’t recommend treating it as another way to hit your macros or “goal weight.” “I’m not anti -weight modification,” Dr. Fundaro explains. “I’m pro safe weight modification. I compare weight loss to contact sports. There are inherent risks but they can be mitigated through best practices.” Dr. Fundaro elaborates: “Since RPE-Eating removes macro-tracking, which can increase risk of disordered eating in some people, and relies on biofeedback and non-hunger triggers, RPE-Eating provides a safety net that macro-tracking alone doesn’t provide.” But if you do want to use RPE-Eating for intentional weight change, what should you do? Dr. Fundaro recommends aiming to hover around the ranges that support your goal. ( As a reminder , a 1 to 3 on the RPE-Eating scale is categorized as “inadequate fuel; a 4 to 7 is categorized as “adequate fuel”; and a 8 to 10 is categorized as “excess fuel.”) ▶ If the goal is weight gain, you’ll likely aim to eat within the 7 to 8 range for most of your meals. ▶ If the goal is weight loss, you’ll likely aim to eat within the 4 to 5 range for most of your meals. A key thing to remember is that you would never use RPE-Eating for extreme weight-modification such as for a bodybuilding competition. “That would be like using physio exercises to prepare for a powerlifting competition.” In other words, it’s not the right tool for the job. If you’re skeptical and think this is just eating “based on your feelings,” keep in mind that RPE was once laughed at by lifters, too. These days, RPE and autoregulation are widely accepted in gym culture and have been studied as a valid method for managing and guiding your training. 1 RPE isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty accurate and incredibly convenient. A lot more convenient than, say, using a velocity loss tracker for every set. 2 3 And while it might seem like it’s all feelings-based, the RPE scale is actually built around practicing the skill of interoceptive awareness —the awareness of internal sensations in your body. The better you get at the skill of interoceptive awareness, the more you’ll be able to use that awareness to make informed decisions about your training. RPE-Eating is similar: It builds the skill of sensing into your own body, and lets your internal sensations guide your decisions. Similar to how the bar slowing down on a squat would indicate you’re getting closer to failure, experiencing the absence of hunger at the end of your meal would indicate you’re closer to being full. Instead of tracking your glucose levels to validate your perceived hunger, you use internal cues that correlate with lowered blood sugar and coincide with hunger. And, let’s be real: Being mindful of stomach grumbling or general hunger pangs is much more convenient and accessible than tracking glucose readings. This process will not be perfect. You may undereat or overeat at first. But over time, with practice, you’ll build the core skills of RPE-Eating. While this tool can be helpful, it’s just a tool. A screwdriver is great, but it isn’t useful when you need a hammer. RPE-Eating can be great for helping you become more aware of your internal hunger cues and build a better relationship with food along the way. It can also be more laborious. It requires paying real attention to your feelings (physical and emotional), and reflecting on them. This can be difficult for anyone—but especially people who aren’t able to sit at the table and have a leisurely meal, like parents with small kids, or people with work schedules that require eating on-the-go. If this is you, just use RPE-Eating when it does work for you—or simply pick and choose specific steps to use in isolation. For example, maybe you try RPE-Eating on the occasional quiet lunch break. Or, maybe you focus solely on developing your awareness of hunger and fullness cues, without trying to change anything else. Tracking macros isn’t inherently bad. It can actually be a helpful tool to teach you more about nutrition. But it’s also not something most people want to do for the rest of their lives. The problem is, if you’ve depended on tracking your food intake, stopping can feel scary. In these cases, RPE-Eating can be used as a kind of off-ramp to help transition away from rigid and restrictive macro tracking. (It can also help loosen the compulsion to “always finish your plate.” Though macros tracking and habitual plate-cleaning may sound different, they’re actually similar: both rely on external cues—such as macro targets or what’s served on your plate—to determine when you’re “done.”) RPE-Eating won’t take away all the scary feelings that may come with changing ingrained ways of eating. However, it can provide some structure and language to help you, or your clients, eat with less fear, less stress, and a bit more confidence. “The goal,” says Dr. Fundaro, “is to know that you’re nourishing yourself—and you don’t need a food tracker to do that.” Click here to view the information sources referenced in this article. 1.

Him: What restaurant? Me: I can’t think of the name. We’ve eaten there before. It’s that place with the peanut shells on the floor? It’s next to… You know… It’s on that road where we used to take the dog to the vet. Do you know the one I’m talking about?? It was as if certain details got lost in a pile of sludge in the deep recesses of my brain. Then, hours later, the details would escape, and I’d shout into an empty room… “Texas Roadhouse!” However, what seemed to be happening to me, increasingly in my late 40s and early 50s, felt far from typical. Not only could I never seem to spit out the names of various restaurants or people or books or movies or so many other things, but my brain was also pooping out during the workday. I’d sit in front of my computer screen, stare at a document, and will myself to do something constructive with my fingertips. Everything seemed hazy, like those first few moments in the morning when you’re awake enough to turn off the alarm but too sleepy to do basic math. I had my good moments, usually in the morning, when I attempted to pack eight hours of writing into the two or three hours I possessed mental clarity. On my worst days, however, I awoke with a haze I never managed to shake. Work was a non-starter. Nor did I have enough bandwidth to read, or do much of anything, really. Three healthcare professionals recommended antidepressants. I tried one, and felt even worse. I tried another. I tried yet another at a higher dose. Still, I felt like a zombie. Another professional gave me a sleeping pill. It left me feeling even more drugged. Someone tested my thyroid. There was nothing wrong with it. Nor was I anemic. I tried supplements, mushroom coffee, and just about any product with the word “think” somewhere on its label. Finally, after nearly two years of seeing a revolving door of doctors, I made an appointment with a gynecologist for my yearly exam. I mentioned vaginal dryness. That information triggered her to ask a string of questions that had nothing to do with my undercarriage. How was my sleep? Mood? Energy levels? Was I experiencing hot flashes? How about brain fog? “Funny you should mention brain fog,” I said in my usual hazy monotone. “I feel like I’m barely alive.” By the end of the visit, I understood that I’d likely never had depression. My gynecologist sent me home with prescriptions for estradiol and progesterone. Within days, it was as if someone had flipped a switch. I could think again. I could type words again. I could follow conversations. I could work past noon. And, for the first time in years, I could sleep more than two hours without waking. Help people improve their health and fitness—while making a great full-time or part-time living doing what you love. Nor is it a disease. Instead, like puberty, it’s a life stage—a transitional moment to be precise. Once you’ve gone 12 consecutive months without a period, you’ve reached menopause. And from that moment onwards, you’re officially “postmenopausal.” As women approach this transitional moment, hormone levels fluctuate and fall, triggering dozens of symptoms. Weight gain and reduced sex drive get a lot of attention. However, during and after menopause, roughly 40 percent of women report increased irritability, mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, and trouble concentrating, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 1 2 As the following image shows, it’s also one of the most vulnerable times in a woman’s life to develop depression, 3 particularly if they’ve struggled in the past with it before.  Before starting hormones, I often found myself sobbing for no reason. Other times, the world’s stimuli felt too… stimulating. Normal everyday sounds—like the buzz of traffic or people at the mall—literally hurt . I was jumpy and irritable and felt anxious about situations that had never bothered me in the past, such as driving over bridges or through construction. Fluctuating hormone levels likely play a role, as do typical age-related changes in the brain. In addition, during this stage of life, women often deal with several issues that siphon cognitive capacity faster than a thirsty vampire drains a carotid. During their 40s and 50s, for example, many women have reached the peak of their careers, with responsibilities that follow them home and keep them up at night. They may also be parenting angst-filled teens, caring for aging parents, adjusting to an empty nest, questioning their marriage, or trying to wrap their bank account around the latest statement from the college bursar or hospital billing department. However, one of the lesser-known and talked about triggers for cognitive discontent has nothing to do with aging or life stress and everything to do with that hallmark menopausal symptom: the hot flash. Hot flashes, which happen during the day, and night sweats, which occur at night, fall under the category of vasomotor symptoms . (The word “vasomotor” refers to the constriction or dilation of blood vessels which, in turn, can influence everything from blood pressure to sweating.) During a hot flash or night sweat, norepinephrine and cortisol levels rise. Blood vessels dilate in an attempt to shed heat. Blood pressure and heart rate increase. Depending on the severity of the hot flash, your skin might redden as sensations of warmth spread through your face, neck, and chest. You might sweat, experience heart palpitations, or feel anxious, tired, or faint. 4 It’s not entirely clear why hot flashes crop up around menopause. According to one theory, falling estrogen levels affect the hypothalamus , the area of the brain involved in temperature regulation. The brain’s internal thermostat gets wonky and occasionally thinks your body is too hot or cold (when it’s not). For many years, experts thought of vasomotor symptoms as mere inconveniences or sources of embarrassment. (To be honest, so did I. During all of those fruitless visits to various healthcare professionals, it never occurred to me to mention them.) However, an increasing body of research has revealed that hot flashes may do more than make us uncomfortable or force us to change our sheets in the middle of the night. They may also affect our blood vessels and brains—and not for the better. 5 For this reason, an increasing number of experts now consider vasomotor symptoms to be a treatable medical condition. 6 7 8 In one study, researchers asked 226 women to wear monitors that tracked when they were experiencing a hot flash. The women also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), filled out sleep diaries, and wore smartwatches that recorded how often they woke at night. 9 As researchers looked at the brain images obtained from women who experienced the most hot flashes, they noticed an abundance of patchy areas called whole-brain white matter intensities. These lesions were once thought of as a typical consequence of aging. However, neuroscientists now believe that the presence of whole-brain white matter intensities is predictive of future cognitive decline. People with an abundance of these brain lesions are twice as likely to get diagnosed with dementia and three times as likely to have a future stroke. 10 It’s thought that the increased presence of whole-brain white matter intensities may stem, in part, from changes taking place in the blood vessels that feed the brain. A three-year study of 492 women supports that theory. It determined that women who experienced frequent hot flashes also tended to experience unhealthy changes in their blood vessels , such as an inability to dilate to accommodate increased blood flow. 11 Other research has linked frequent hot flashes with increases in the following: In addition to directly affecting the blood vessels, frequent hot flashes may also affect the brain by disturbing sleep. 17 Interestingly, many women don’t necessarily know that hot flashes are disturbing their sleep. They may instead—as I did—assume they have insomnia or sleep apnea. That’s because night sweats aren’t always sweaty. By the time a surge in cortisol and norepinephrine jolts a woman awake, the hotness of the flash may have dissipated. So, it can feel as if she’s repeatedly waking, over and over and over again, for no discernable reason. These frequent awakenings may interfere with the brain’s ability to consolidate memories, metabolize toxins, and store all the names, dates, and facts one encounters daily. It can also lead to lost connectivity in the hippocampus , a part of the brain that’s important for learning and memory. Sleep loss also means the amygdala , a part of the brain involved in emotion, becomes more reactive, causing people to feel more easily stressed, anxious, irritable, frustrated, or enraged. 18 19 All of these brain changes can set in after just days to a week of lost sleep. So, imagine what happens when you’ve been waking over and over again—for years. To diagnose depression, healthcare professionals use a tool called the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale. If you check off four of the nine symptoms on the scale, you’re considered depressed. However, four of the symptoms on the checklist also overlap with the symptoms of menopause-related sleep deprivation: Check off those four items, and you might be diagnosed with depression, even if what’s really ailing you is the battle with sleep you’ve been waging since you turned 47. Another problem: On surveys, 80 percent of medical residents admit they feel “barely comfortable” talking about menopause. 20 In addition, few residency programs—including ob-gyn residency programs—offer training in it. 21 Given the above, it’s no wonder so many healthcare professionals never think to ask about hot flashes or sleep disturbances when people like me show up complaining of fatigue, lack of gumption, and an inability to focus. In addition, even when it’s clear that vasomotor symptoms are leading to cognitive and emotional symptoms, many healthcare professionals still shy away from prescribing menopausal hormone therapy (also called hormone replacement therapy, or HRT), often telling women that supplemental hormones are “not safe” or “too risky.” These professionals are practicing what Michigan-based menopause-trained gynecologist Jerrold H. Weinberg, MD, calls “defensive medicine.” “It’s one of the first reflexes doctors have when they recommend a treatment,” says Dr. Weinberg. “They worry they’re going to get sued.” These worries are based on research done several decades ago that linked the use of certain types of hormones with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer or stroke. 22 However, according to more recent research, that small increased risk seems to depend on several other factors, such as age, dose, the type of hormonal preparation, and the duration of hormone use. 23 24 As long as you’re younger than 60 and have been postmenopausal for fewer than 10 years, many experts now say the benefits outweigh the risks for women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms. 25 It’s also counterbalanced by health benefits such as reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or osteoporosis, says Dr. Weinberg, who confirms the health benefits of menopause hormone therapy far outweigh the risks for most women. Because some antidepressants can lift mood, improve sleep, and reduce hot flashes, some healthcare professionals turn to them instead of menopause hormone therapy. As with any medicine, antidepressants have their own list of side effects. However, for someone practicing defensive medicine, they often seem like a safer bet, says Dr. Weinberg. 26 27 28 If you or your client are on what seems like a never-ending quest to find a healthcare professional who understands menopause, use the following advice from Dr. Weinberg and Helen Kollias, PhD, an expert on physiology and molecular biology and science advisor at Precision Nutrition and Girls Gone Strong. ▶ Seek care from a menopause-trained health professional . Usually, these professionals list this training and interest in their bio. For example, they might list “menopause” as an area of focus. You can also search this database for practitioners who have earned a certification from the Menopause Society. ▶ Document your symptoms . Write them down. That way, if you feel foggy or nervous during your appointment, you can lean on your notes. This information can also help you judge whether MHT or another medicine is working. Based on your symptom data, you and your healthcare professional may decide to switch to a different medicine or change your dose. Consider tracking: ▶ Be as specific as you can during your appointment. Saying something like “I don’t sleep well,” is less likely to get you the right kind of help than saying, “During the past seven days, I’ve only gotten four uninterrupted hours once. I wake, on average, five times a night. On a typical night, my longest stretch of sleep is three hours.” If you use a smartwatch, come ready to fire up your health app, so your healthcare professional can see the data. ▶ Talk about the pros and cons of treatment . There’s a concept in medicine known as “shared decision-making.” Part of that process involves frank discussions about the benefits and risks of a given treatment. Then, patients and clinicians work together to make decisions based on those benefits and risks. Many healthcare networks encourage clinicians to use shared decision-making, as it seems to reduce patient complaints as well as malpractice lawsuits. 29 30 For this reason, shared decision-making can help shift a healthcare professional out of the “defensive medicine” mindset. You might ask questions like: The lifestyle habits that improve mental and emotional health during menopause aren’t terribly different from the lifestyle habits that improve overall health—for any person, at any stage of life. Other than avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy or hot foods, there’s no special diet for people with vasomotor symptoms. (And by the way, tofu and other soy products don’t seem to help with vasomotor symptoms as much as once thought 30 —though they’re still nutritious.) Healthy behaviors don’t necessarily change during middle age. Nutrition, physical activity, stress management, sleep, social connectedness, and a sense of purpose matter just as much during the menopausal transition as they do when we’re younger. However, these fundamentals are even more important to dial in as life progresses. So consider: If you answered “no” to some or all of those questions, consider why that is. What’s stopping you? How might you remove barriers or shore up support to make those fundamentals easier? In addition to helping to blunt age- and hormone-related losses in muscle and bone mass, creatine may also help bolster mood and brain function while reducing mental fatigue. It also seems to counter some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation. 32 33 Research shows a daily dose of 5 to 7 grams of creatine monohydrate is effective. In addition to helping you feel alert, sunlight helps to set the internal clock in your brain that makes you sleepy at night and spunky in the morning. Morning and late afternoon light exposure seem particularly potent. In a study of 103 people, exposure to morning sunlight predicted better sleep quality the following night. When people spent time outdoors in the mornings, they fell asleep more quickly, slept longer, and experienced fewer awakenings the following evening. 34 Sunlight may also improve mood and concentration. 35 If you’re already worn out, long, intense exercise sessions will likely make you feel worse. For one, injuries crop up much more easily at middle age than during our 20s and 30s. In addition, it takes longer to recover between sessions. 36 String too many overly zealous workouts too close together, and you’ll not only likely start to feel achy but also more irritable, tense, and tired. However, much like a cold shower, short bursts of exercise may help you to feel alert during the day. If you’re falling asleep at your desk, encourage yourself to take short movement breaks such as a 5- or 10-minute walk outdoors or a quick set of pushups or squats. In addition, you may find gentle exercise—such as yoga or stretching—helps you relax before bed. Just don’t make it too intense, or you’ll trigger a release of adrenaline. Whenever you exercise, tune into how your body feels, especially after a particularly bad night of sleep. We’re not saying you should never exercise vigorously or try to beat your lifting PRs. However, depending on your sleep and recovery, you might want to pare things back, especially if you’ve traditionally hit the gym hard. You can still do intense sessions—just balance them out with more moderate sessions, as well as proportionate recovery. Depending on how you feel, you might decide to go all out, as usual. However, you might also decide to do a zone 2 training session instead of an intense run. Or, if you’re resistance training, you might still do your planned session, but reduce the number of sets, reps, or volume lifted. This research-based therapy for insomnia can help you develop skills and mental reframes that encourage sound sleep. For example, a CBT-I therapist will help you develop the skill of getting up at the same time every day, regardless of how badly you slept (or didn’t sleep) the night before. (Read more: Three CBT-I skills that can transform how you sleep .) You may not have the energy (or desire) to do everything you did when you were younger. (When you were 36, your daily checklist defied time and space.) As a result, you might benefit from looking critically at your current responsibilities to see which ones you can shrink or downsize. For several days, track how you spend your time and bandwidth. Then, analyze your data. Ask yourself: If you’re a coach, use the Wheel of Stress Assessment to help clients identify different dimensions of their life that might be draining their mental and emotional capacity. (When you know specifically where your stress is coming from, you have a better chance of resolving it.) If it’s demands from other people that prevent you from prioritizing self-care and recovery, you might like to read: How saying “no” can seriously change your life . You might find you sleep better and experience fewer night sweats if you sleep in a cooler environment. Try turning down the thermostat a couple of degrees, using a fan, or investing in an electric cooling mattress pad. When you feel the fog take over your brain, it’s not likely you’ll be doing “your best work” anyway. So, for a block of time—say, 20 minutes—permit yourself to do nothing. You might: If you need a quick “refresh,” you can also try a 5-minute mind-body scan. Get your body into a comfortable position. For example, you might use the yoga “legs up the wall” pose or lie down and place a pillow under your knees. Then, close your eyes and bring your attention to physical sensations in your body. Start at your head, and work your way down to your toes. Don’t judge or rush to change anything. Just observe, like a scientist. You can also scan your mind, for example, by noticing thoughts. When you’ve completed the scan, consider: You don’t have to “do” anything with the information you uncover, just notice. The foods that protect the blood vessels around your heart can also protect the blood vessels in your brain. For example, both the MIND and Mediterranean diets are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and depression. 37 38 These eating patterns are rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, olives, beans, fish, and other minimally-processed whole foods. In addition, nitrate-rich foods like beets and dark, leafy greens may help to dilate blood vessels, temporarily improving memory by helping more blood to reach the brain. 39 40 (For more on how our diet can support brain function and emotional regulation, read: Nutrition and mental health: What (and how) to eat ) It’s frustrating when you feel like you can’t do it all. Believe me. I know. However, this stage of life presents a hidden opportunity, forcing you to re-evaluate what’s most important. Before going on hormones, as my ability to type coherent words and phrases diminished, I was forced to ask an important question: Do I really need to be doing this? It was more of an existential question than a career-related one, and it allowed me to reassess how I wanted to spend my limited mental resources. Given that I was self-employed, I didn’t actually need to be working eight hours a day. That was a gift, wasn’t it? Maybe I also didn’t need to cook dinner six nights out of seven. Maybe the recipes I chose could be simplified, too. Finally, maybe saying “no” a lot more often and without regret would allow me to continue to say yes to the things that mattered most. Things like visiting my aging parents. And picking up the phone whenever my kid called from college. Or meeting a friend for a meandering walk around town. Thanks to the hormones and life tweaks, I now have energy again. I’m also clear-headed most of the time. However, I still tend to end my work day around 3 p.m. Why? Because I can, and I want to.

And the above quote has become one of her taglines. Though Coach Kate has coached thousands of “regular” clients, her specialty is coaching other coaches. Through her work as an instructor with PN’s Level 2 Master Health Coaching Certification , a facilitator for PN’s private online coaching communities, and a coach in her own private practice, she gets a front-row view of all the questions and challenges both new and seasoned coaches have. Coach Kate knows what other coaches are up to. She’s seen the victories and the blunders of thousands of coaches, and today, she’ll share three common mistakes she sees them making. If there’s anything Coach Kate wants, it’s to see her peers achieve wild success, so her hope with this article is to help coaches: We’ll cover three common coaching mistakes, plus the solutions to overcome them. Let’s get into it. Coach Kate describes a coaching business as a three-legged stool. “The vast majority of folks who get into coaching start with the coaching leg,” says Kate. “They want to become the best coach they can be, which is amazing. However, to become the best coach you can be, information and theory only get you so far.” As Kate says, “You cannot become the best coach you can be in a vacuum, talking to yourself in your office.” Which is why she suggests challenging the desire many coaches have to wait until their knowledge is “complete.” Instead, she suggests, just start selling. Why? Coaches who start selling sooner also get to start coaching sooner. Over time, they’ll have an advantage over the coaches who want to be “the BEST coach they can be” by getting 12 certifications before selling their services. Meanwhile, the coach who “doesn’t really know what they’re doing” but has started practicing anyway will begin building their business and their coaching experience—and likely improve their odds of overall success. There’s a natural inclination among aspiring coaches who want to do a good job to get those 12 certifications before they start coaching. “Sometimes we hold on to this hope that we’ll get to a point where we feel confident enough at fielding any question that ever comes our way,” Kate says. Because as every coach knows, when you start telling people what you do, they’ll have questions. And often, they’ll have questions you can’t answer, and that can feel uncomfortable… mortifying even. (You’re supposed to be the expert , right??) According to Coach Kate, the above belief—that you’re supposed to be an authority with all the answers—is based on an erroneous assumption. “When I show up to a coaching conversation, my role is not ‘the expert,’” she says. Yes, coaches have to show up to client interactions with a baseline of nutrition knowledge. (For example, if a client asks you about good sources of protein, you should be able to list some.) But coaches don’t have to show up with a prepared lecture, or encyclopedic knowledge of nutrition minutia or biochemistry. (You don’t have to feel bad if you can’t recall the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 in flax oil, or all the steps in the Krebs cycle that produces ATP.) Even when you know the answer, Kate suggests that not answering right away can actually be more productive. “If a client asks you about seed oils, you can simply say, ‘That’s a great question. I can get you some information on that if you’d like, but I’m curious, why do you ask?’” While the expert might respond with a summary of the latest research on seed oil processing and its health effects, the coach will strive to learn more about why the question is meaningful to the client. For example, after inquiring further, you may learn that your client heard about seed oils from their friend Susan, who changed the fat sources in her diet and lost ten pounds. And the client is curious to see if they might also lose ten pounds if they eliminate seed oils. With this kind of response, you learn more about what the client is really after (a weight loss solution), which ultimately helps direct you to more effective strategies (which probably have nothing to do with seed oils). ▶ Takeaway nugget: Coaches should have a firm understanding of fitness and nutrition principles. However, clients often don’t need more information; they need coaching . When a client asks you a question, consider whether the answer will help them take action. If it will, offer them what you know. (If you don’t know the answer, you can simply say, “I’m happy to find more information about that for you.”) If it won’t, consider turning their question into a coaching opportunity. Ask, “Can you tell me why you’re curious about that?” Their answers will likely lead you to a more productive conversation. Now, maybe it sounds obvious that clients aren’t just clones of us. That said, especially when we feel all warm and vibe-y with our clients, it can be easy to forget in the moment. For example, maybe you’re someone who… If you’re a coach, you probably went into this line of work because you value nutrition, exercise, and overall health. And often, we assume our clients hold these same values. But the truth is, that’s not always the case. Says Kate: “There’s nothing inherently superior about valuing your health. If you do, yes, you’ll probably experience better health and live longer. But not everyone shares those values. That’s a tough one to swallow.” Of course, without seeing your clients for the unique people they are—with their own individual preferences, values, and goals—you may find yourself suggesting behaviors that aren’t possible for them, or striving for goals that aren’t meaningful to them. Over time, this becomes frustrating for your clients and you: They feel like you don’t “get” them, and you feel like a “bad” coach. The opposite of assuming (often unconsciously) that clients are like you is, well, assuming nothing. As best as you can, check your biases and assumptions at the door, and approach each client session with an open, curious mind. Ask questions, such as: “What inspired you—or pushed you—to come in today?” And: “Why is that goal meaningful to you?” And: “What skills do you have today that might help you achieve your goal? What skills do you feel you might be missing?” Listen. Withholding assumptions can be particularly difficult when clients share some obvious similarities with you. (Perhaps they’re also a single mom, or they’re also training for a triathlon, or they’re also a cancer survivor.) But even when clients share similar experiences or goals, their biology, social context, personal history, and many other factors can make their “similar” experiences, in fact, totally different. Coach Kate says in these cases, you can show that you relate to them, while also inviting them to describe their own experience. She suggests using the following question: “I know what [ insert shared experience ] has been like for me, but what has [ insert shared experience ] been like for you?” Once you have a clear picture of a client’s values, priorities, and reasons for change, you can assess which actions they’re ready, willing, and able to take. (Again, don’t make assumptions here. Just because you find meal prep quick and easy, doesn’t mean your client will.) If you want to go through this exercise with your client on paper, use our Ready, Willing, and Able Worksheet . ▶ Takeaway nugget: Remember that clients: Get to know your unique client, their specific goals, and what actions they can realistically execute (and maybe even get excited about). This is, actually, very natural. “There’s a reason we go into coaching. It’s because we care and we want to help clients. We want to see them succeed,” says Coach Kate. But caring can be a double-edged sword. “With our clients, we carefully decide on the habits and behaviors that need to occur… And then they walk off and either do the thing or don’t do the thing. That’s brutal.” No matter how sound and foolproof your advice is, how well-thought out your plan, how much you care, ultimately, you have no control over whether a client executes it, and gets results. Naturally, as a coach, you might feel frustrated, even heartbroken when clients don’t do what they say they’ll do, or when they’re not seeing the outcomes they were hoping to see. However, according to Kate, this isn’t something coaches should try to avoid completely. It’s part of the job, and it’s often a sign that your work has meaning to you. (It’s a good thing.) “However, I think there’s a point there where we can start caring more than the client themselves,” she says. And that’s precisely where to draw to the line. At PN, we often say that “care units” are the currency of coaching. Care units are how much time, energy, attention, authenticity, and true “heart” you can bring to helping, serving, and caring about your clients. Your client also has a certain amount of care units. How much time, energy, attention, authenticity, and “heart” can they bring to their own change and growth projects? (Most of the time, not that much. Which is totally normal.) Our advice: Care one care unit less than your client does. How do you do that? One approach… So, how do we maintain an appropriate level of emotional investment—but also help clients stay on track? “This is where I really like to get really clear on what my role is as a coach,” Coach Kate says. “Because if you are very, very clear on what your role is as a coach, then you can sort of go through the list, and check in with yourself: ‘Did I show up? Did I follow up? Did I coach this person to the best of my ability?’” For example, as a coach, it’s reasonable to be responsible for: Meanwhile, the client is responsible for: Ideally, clearly delineating these responsibilities should happen early in the coaching relationship. Some coaches prefer to have an open discussion, while others have actual contracts that outline coach deliverables and client expectations. This early communication can also be a way of vetting coach-client “fit.” “When I’m having that initial conversation with a prospective client, I can ask, ‘What does accountability look like to you?’ If the client replies, ‘Well, I want you to text me every morning and night, and I want you to make sure I’ve done my workout, and also ship groceries to my house,’ then I will be the one to say, ‘I don’t think this is a good fit.’” Coach Kate says this kind of early clarity can also prevent coach-client friction in the future. Clear boundaries and expectations at the outset means clients are less likely to be disappointed if they assumed their coach was going to “take on” more, and coaches are less likely to burn out from shouldering more than they should. It even protects the coach-client relationship in extreme (though not uncommon) situations such as when a client “ghosts” before a paid contract is over. “When somebody doesn’t reply to me, I don’t take it personally. It’s not their job to reply, but it is my job to check in,” Coach Kate says. “If I don’t hear back, I just check in on Monday, and then again on Monday. And again, and again, and again—trying all the contact methods they’ve provided me—until their coaching contract is over. If we get to that point, they’ll get an email from me saying, ‘Hey, I hope everything’s okay. My door is always open. I hope you’re doing well.’” ▶ Takeaway nugget: Make a list—either for your own reference, or to include in a contract that new clients have to sign—of the accountabilities you have as a coach. (Hint: These are usually specific actions , like “Text, email, or phone once a week to check in” or “Host monthly virtual lectures on various nutrition topics for group clients.”) Make sure to have a conversation about expectations and responsibilities with all clients, ideally before beginning to work together, or at least in the first session. It’s maybe not the most “coach-y” way to write an article: Point out a list of your mistakes, then hand you solutions to deal with them. But if you’ve made the above “mistakes,” we want you to hear it from us: We’re proud of you. If you’ve gotten sidetracked by the above, it’s likely because you really care. And that’s never going to be a mistake; it’s a strength. That said, although these “mistakes” are completely normal, and most coaches make them, they can limit your potential as a coach, and as a business. And we want to see you succeed.

Anna’s a highly competent law professional. She’s a critical thinker and she fights in the heavyweight division when it comes to cutting through BS. But the Anna I knew was falling into some painful traps that seemed to be bypassing her inner hawk-like skeptic. She’s wanted to lose around 15lbs for some time now and came to me to share how stuck she was feeling in this goal. She brought up an avenue she was exploring: the new BPA-free tupperware set. “Interesting. What inspired you to focus on that?” I asked. “Well, I’ve been reading about how microplastics in food containers can mess up our hormones and cause weight gain,” she said. I squinted. To backtrack, this is right after she told me how she’d been struggling to be consistent at the gym, had been relying on takeout too often, and had been sacrificing boring old sleep for adrenaline-inducing doom scrolling. So I asked: “What about trying to get more consistent with your workouts, or prepping more homemade meals during the week?” And Anna said: “Yeah, but I’ve tried that a thousand times. If it were that simple, it would have worked already.” Ignored or delayed those hard-but-worthwhile habit changes in favor of some ultra-specific, niche magic bullet that’s supposed to “change everything.” Spent hours of research on the ultimate, most optimal workout instead of devoting those hours to just doing the basic workout you already know how to do. Waited to feel more inspired, motivated, or just less busy . Why do we do this? Buying new gear or a popular supplement feels like making progress. Consuming YouTube videos or articles about stuff you can change feels like you’re doing something. And waiting until the “right time” feels , well, right. Except, nothing actually changes until we take real, consistent action. We’re clever, us humans. And we’ve come up with lots of sneaky ways to avoid the basic, unsexy, difficult actions we need to take that actually drive change. In this article, we’ll explore how to take an honest and compassionate look at why you might be distracting yourself from taking impactful action. You’ll learn: We all know what those basic, fundamental health habits are: ▶ Exercising, ideally 30 minutes a day , putting in moderate-to-vigorous amounts of effort, with a mix of aerobic and resistance training. ▶ Eating mostly nutritious, minimally-processed foods. If 80 percent of your diet comes from whole or minimally-processed foods, you’re doing an excellent job. (Translation: “Perfection” isn’t required; pizza can be part of a healthy diet.) ▶ Eating enough protein to support muscle mass, appetite regulation, and body recomposition goals, if you have them. Aim for about 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (for most people, this adds up to about 4-6 palm-sized portions of lean protein per day). ▶ Prioritizing getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep. You can’t always control how well you sleep, but having some wind-down time before bed can help, as can waking up at the same time every day. ▶ Avoiding or at least reducing excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs, including cigarettes. No fun, we know. But it’s for a good cause. Easily, we could add stuff like prioritizing positive, nurturing social relationships, managing stress, and probably others, but just the above list is uncommonly met. In fact, only six percent of Americans perform all five of the following basic health behaviors: 1 If you’re doing the math, that means close to 94 percent of Americans aren’t doing the basics. Yet, these foundational behaviors also help us achieve a long list of common goals, whether that’s reaching a healthy weight, improving athletic ability, or just living a longer, healthier life. So why do we struggle so much to do them? Here are three common barriers we see among clients (and coaches!), plus potential solutions to overcome them. That push-and-pull feeling you have when you think about making a change? It has a name, and it’s called ambivalence. Ambivalence describes the mix of feelings you have when you contemplate, say, waking up earlier so your mornings are less stressful, or cutting down on TV time. We naturally and normally feel ambivalence about change—“I want this, and at the same time, that.” (For example, wanting to eat healthier, and also wanting to have your favorite treats whenever you want without constraint.) We also naturally and normally feel resistance towards change—“I want this, and at the same time, not.” (For example, wanting to stop using your phone as a mindless distraction, but not wanting to deal with the anxiety you get whenever you’re left with your own thoughts.) These contradictory emotions can seem frustrating, puzzling, or “illogical.” Yet, ambivalence and resistance are fundamental parts of the change process . The higher the stakes of change, the more likely we are to feel a mix of strong and unexpected emotions, pushback, rebellion, angst, and other types of resistance and ambivalence. Rather than signaling that the change is a wrong move, strong ambivalence and resistance tend to signal that this change matters to us. In a sense, it’s good news. It tells us we care.  Maybe you’ve decided you want to be healthier. So you declare that, starting Monday, you’re going to exercise for an hour everyday and “eat clean” at every meal and sleep eight hours every night. (Currently, you don’t have a regular exercise habit, don’t particularly like vegetables, and regularly stay up past midnight.) Now, let’s be honest: You’re asking yourself to change a lot of stuff at once. And the last time you created an elaborate plan for overhauling your life… … Did it work? Probably not. (And that’s okay.) When we feel frustrated or stuck in our current situation, making a plan filled with idealistic dreams can provide us temporary relief. And our brain has several (normal) cognitive biases that prevent us from judging the future accurately. We often think we’ll have more time, energy, attention, and motivation in the future than we really do. 2 3 4 5 There’s a powerful, instantaneous comfort that comes with overloading our future self. (Because after all, we won’t start the plan until Monday.) The problem with this is: Big, complex plans often don’t fit into our already busy, complex lives. We under-estimate how many smaller tasks are hidden in the bigger plans. When we (almost inevitably) are unable to execute these ambitious goals, we blame ourselves, our personality traits, our “willpower” or “discipline,” and build a pitiable story about how we “struggle with consistency.” Or how living this way is “impossible”. Then, sadly, we fulfill that prophecy. This barrier comes from the following common belief: “If getting healthy just took eating, sleeping, and exercising moderately well, then everyone would be healthy.” Because everyone knows they should eat their vegetables, get seven to eight hours of sleep per night, and stay active, right? (We’d agree.) But let’s go back to the previously mentioned statistic: Only 6 percent of Americans are consistently performing the most basic health and fitness behaviors. If we add on slightly more advanced—but still very basic—behaviors like eating five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, optimizing protein intake, and effectively managing stress, that number would shrink significantly. So, the first thing is to believe that these simple behaviors work. Because they do. It’s just that most people (probably close to 99 percent of us) are not doing them all simultaneously and consistently . The second thing is to accept that these simple behaviors are a little bit boring. Because they are. Part of the reason we’re attracted to new diets or “magical” supplements is because we just want something more interesting to try. That’s especially true if we’ve already sort of tried the “eat more vegetables” thing and it didn’t “work” for us in the way we expected. With something new and cutting-edge, there’s also the possibility of a new outcome, a new us. And of course, that’s incredibly appealing. Thing is, most hardcore, “industry secret,” or “cutting edge” tools and strategies are, respectively: unsustainable, inaccessible, or ineffective (or unproven). They’ll take your effort, your time, and often your money, but without giving you a good return on your investment—all the while distracting you from the stuff that actually works. Another lie in the health and fitness industry is that you have to be “perfect” to maintain great health. You know, eat only organic salads and chia seeds, be able to run a marathon, and wake up at 5 am every day to meditate and write in your gratitude journal. The truth is, perfection definitely isn’t required. Depending on how you look at this, this could be a relief to hear, or a disappointment. On the one hand, it’s nice to know that you don’t have to have it “all together” to be healthy—even above-average healthy. On the other hand, many of us pursue better health with the belief that our optimal or even “perfect” self will one day, with the right plan or routine, be attainable. But “perfect” health is an illusion. Humans, even exceptionally healthy ones, get sick, get weird rashes, have digestive problems, need reading glasses, get into slumps, or just otherwise have a series of bad days. None of us are “safe” from those life events, and accepting that can feel a little… vulnerable. It’s much more comfortable to believe that if you just take this powdered algae supplement, or follow this specific morning routine, you’ll be immune to any kind of painful human experience. The irony is, to achieve your realistic “best self,” you probably have to accommodate your “worst self” too. You know, the one who’d rather watch another episode of Love is Blind than work out, or eat a party-size bag of Doritos and call it dinner. Because life happens. Work gets busy. Or your kid goes through a “phase.” Or it’s pie season. Any number of obstacles, distractions, and competing demands make it impossible for perfection to be maintained with any kind of consistency. Which is why we need to let go of the illusion that a “perfect” self exists—the one who always has the energy, will, and option to make the ideal choice—and support what our real self wants and needs. We’ve got four steps below to help you. Now that we know what’s potentially getting in the way of taking productive action, here are four steps to get unstuck. Before you (or a client) start undertaking something you want to change, it’s helpful to understand your deeper motivations first. Do a little investigating by asking questions like: You can also go through one of our favorite motivation-mining exercises, The 5 Whys . When you know why you want to change something, and you’re clear on the consequences of not taking action, you’ll be more likely to feel that deeper, more sustaining push to keep going, even when things get tough. We can do all the things!! Really!! We just can’t do all the things… all at once. Effective change means being able to realistically: What are the essentials in relation to your goal? Regardless of all goals, they likely include a movement practice, a nutrition practice, and/or a recovery practice. If you want some guidance on how to select the most effective action for your goal, check out our Skills, Practices, and Daily Actions Cheat Sheet. Here’s how to use it: ▶ Start with the domain you’re most interested in improving (such as “Nutrition” or “Stress”). ▶ Then, get specific about what skill within that domain you’d like to improve (for example, “Eat well intuitively”), plus the practice that most appeals to you within that skill (say, “Eat to satisfied”). ▶ Lastly, choose a daily action from the list of examples under your chosen practice. (For example, “Record hunger and fullness levels at the start and end of meals.”) Once you choose your action, make it work for you by following step 3, below. “I like to challenge a client to set a pathetic goal. If it’s so pathetic, then obviously you can do it, right?” says Kate Solovieva, PN Super Coach and Director of Community Engagement. Sound inspiring? Maybe not. But if you’ve been struggling with consistency, it’s exactly where to start. Ask yourself: Five minutes of walking? 10 push-ups? One extra portion of veggies? Three conscious deep breaths before every meal? Nothing is too small; it just has to be something. Now you’ve got your floor. Then ask yourself: One-hour of all-out effort at the gym? Two hours of meal prep that will feed you and your family for the next three days? A 45-minute guided meditation? This is your ceiling. Now that you’ve identified your “floor” and your “ceiling,” you’ve defined a flexible range of actions that can adapt to your fluctuating, unpredictable, real life. But applying this range requires a paradigm shift: Your health habits aren’t an “on” or “off” switch; they’re on a dial. When life is sweet and smooth, you can turn your exercise, nutrition, and sleep dials way up—if you want. Bust through your PRs at the gym, eat all the arugula, meditate like a monk. But if life gets nuts, you don’t have to switch off completely. Just turn the dial down a little. The below is a visual representation of how this might work for exercise, but you can apply this same thinking to your nutrition, sleep, stress management, or whatever you’re working on.  The important part: Even if you do your “floor” or “dial level 1” action—even if it’s for days on end—it still “counts.” You still get the gold star. Doing the bare minimum isn’t failing. It’s succeeding, in the context of a real, messy, beautiful life. Health and fitness professionals often forget how different their lives are from their clients. For example, many coaches work at gyms, enjoy being physically active, and hang out with other active people. Exercising regularly is almost easier to do than not do , because, as Coach Kate says, “they’ve built a life that makes that habit seamless.” So if you want to make your health goals more likely, Coach Kate offers this advice: “Build an ecosystem that makes failing nearly impossible.” When they want to make a change, many people assume that good intentions and willpower will be enough to carry them through. (And when they fail, naturally, they blame themselves for being “bad” or “weak.”) We often forget about the context and environment that shapes our behaviors —making certain actions more likely or less likely to occur. A recent review from Nature Reviews Psychology ranked different behavior change strategies and found that access was the number one influencer of people’s behaviors. (People who lived in neighborhoods with affordable grocers close by ate better, just like people who had to drive a long distance to the closest gym were less likely to exercise. 6 ) Not everyone can change neighborhoods, but most people have some degree of control over their more immediate environments, and can leverage this power to shape desired behaviors. One example is the “ kitchen makeover ,” where you make sure foods you want to eat are washed, prepped, and at the front of the fridge, ready to eat on a whim. Meanwhile, foods that don’t support your goals get tossed, or relegated to the highest cupboard. (When you need a stepladder from the basement to reach the cookies, you might find you eat them less.) (If you want to try it out, check out our Kitchen Set-up Assessment worksheet.) Think about the goal you want to achieve, and the behaviors that support it. Then, evaluate how you might make small changes to your environment by: Invest your energy building the ecosystem that nudges you to make desired actions the obvious choice. This requires a little more work on the front end, but the payoff will be greater for less overall work. If you’re a perfectionist, or a former straight-A student, that line hurt to read. (Don’t worry. This C+ won’t result in your parents telling you that they’re disappointed.) But what all of the above barriers and solutions have in common, is that they recognize and work with our inherent imperfection. None of us is perfect, and expecting as much often results in failure (or at best, short bursts of success, followed by a crash). Adopt an attitude of compassion and acceptance towards your human self—who’s most likely trying their hardest—and work with your vulnerabilities, instead of constantly expecting yourself to grit your teeth against them. There will be times you’re getting “A’s” in fitness. That’s awesome. And you also don’t need to aim for C+. Just don’t think of yourself as a failure when you have to dial it down. Living a healthy, meaningful life means constantly striving to do our best—while also allowing for flexibility, mistakes, and bad days (or seasons).

When you’re juggling work, family, and more all at once, cooking might not be your top priority. But with a few easy recipes at your fingertips, meal prep can make life simpler and less stressful. Here’s a roundup of eight easy vegetarian recipes that you can whip up at home. Not only are they plant-based and simple to follow, they taste absolutely delicious. You can tackle vegetarian cooking in no time. With its focus on plant-based proteins, fresh produce, and hearty whole grains—a vegetarian diet provides many health benefits while making nutritious eating feel vibrant, satisfying, and sustainable. People choose to be vegetarian for a host of different reasons—including environmental sustainability, animal welfare, health issues, religion, and more ( 2 ). Today it’s simpler than ever to go meatless with more plant-based staples on shelves, more vegetarian dishes at restaurants, and more trustworthy recipes at your fingertips. If you’re worried about missing nutrients without meat, take a breath—you won’t. “Vegetarians can absolutely get all their nutrient needs met ,” says MyFitnessPal dietitian Katherine Basbaum. The key is building meals around nutrient-dense whole foods like beans, grains, veggies, nuts, and seeds rather than leaning on ultra-processed options that are nutrient-poor and high in sugar and salt.. Vegetarian diets can actually be very beneficial if you eat minimally processed, whole foods ( 1 ). In addition to added fiber, benefits include a range of: Basbaum says these benefits can help lower risk for heart disease and help manage blood sugar, blood pressure, and weight ( 1 ). Vegetarian cooking doesn’t need to be scary or overwhelming. Here’s a few tips to save time, money, and energy: 9 Easy Mediterranean Recipes See something you like?

This chickpea “tuna” salad sandwich mimics the taste and texture of your typical tuna sandwich. Full of chickpeas, celery, and red onion, this dish serves up 18 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein while being low in saturated fat. All you really need for this dish is a bowl and spoon. Simply mix everything together and sandwich your mixture between two slices of bread for a delicious handheld lunch. You can also spice things up a bit with dijon mustard, lemon juice, relish, dill, or whatever else you like.

This simple soufflé packs in flavor, texture, and lots of protein. The earthy Swiss chard adds a hearty, slightly bitter contrast to the creamy, tangy cottage cheese, while fluffy eggs bind it all together into a light yet satisfying low-carb dish. Although this dish takes a bit of time to bake in the oven, the end product is absolutely worth it. It’s good for meal prep, so cut the soufflé into squares and save for an easily-microwaved breakfast. It also works well as a savory brunch centerpiece or a light dinner paired with a side salad.

She is an incoming junior at Northwestern University studying Journalism, Economics, and Integrated Marketing Communications. Her work has been published in The Daily Northwestern and Spoon University. Expert Reviewed By: Lauren Cuda, RD Lauren Cuda, RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal.

She is passionate about leveraging technology and data to improve nutrition accessibility and enhance patient outcomes through evidence-based practice. You’ve seen it all over social media this summer: seafood boils are one of the hottest food trends online right now . Imagine a covered table with a couple plates on the perimeter and an enormous pile of seafood, corn, potatoes, and sausage in the middle. The food is smothered in a flavorful sauce, and just the sight of the food makes your mouth water. Sounds delicious, right? Seafood boil is often viewed as a special occasion meal—but with a couple of ingredient tweaks, it can actually be a nutrient-rich meal that supports your goals. So, what little tweaks can you make to create a seafood boil a dietitian would approve of? Well, we asked one. Here’s what MyFitnessPal registered dietitian Lauren Cuda has to say about it. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that you eat at least 8 ounces of seafood per week ( 1 ). There’s a host of different seafood options that restaurants and grocery stores offer to go into your seafood boil—but what is considered the best, nutritionally? With its chewy texture and coveted flavor, lobster is a lean protein that is low in saturated fat and high in minerals like calcium and potassium ( 2 ). However, a 100 g serving of lobster (equivalent to one tail) contains 535 mg of sodium ( 2 ), which is about 23% of the daily recommended sodium limit. “It’s best to monitor sodium intake throughout the rest of the day,” says Cuda. Crab is a sweet, slightly buttery, and tender seafood that is another great lean protein source. Its nutritional benefits are very similar to lobster, but crab has slightly fewer calories and less sodium ( 3 ). A 100 g serving of crab provides 17% of the daily recommended sodium intake. While lobster and crab are more popular on America’s coasts, crawfish are a Southern staple, particularly in Louisiana. Crawfish are another lean protein, but have the added benefit of containing high amounts of vitamin B-12 ( 4 ). Crawfish contain a lower sodium content than lobster and crab, so Cuda says they’re a good choice if you’re watching your salt intake. Protein Cold Foam Is All Over Coffee Menus—Here’s How to Make It Yourself Cuda calls clams a nutrient-dense shellfish option. They’re high in protein and vitamin B-12, while staying low in saturated fat and sodium ( 5 ). 100 g of clams, which is about seven clams, contains 14.7 g of protein ( 5 ). Similar to crawfish and clams, mussels contain lots of protein and vitamin B-12 ( 6 ). Their sodium content is moderate, as 100 g of mussels contain 16% of the daily recommended sodium intake ( 6 ). In addition to being high in protein and vitamin B-12, shrimp have the added benefit of containing omega-3 fatty acids ( 7 ). They also have a deliciously chewy texture and sweet taste. Like many of the above seafood options, shrimp have a moderate sodium content, with 100 g (equivalent to 10 small shrimp, 7 jumbo shrimp, or 5 prawns) containing 15% of the recommended daily sodium intake ( 7 ). There are so many great seafood options out there to add into a seafood boil. The type of seafood you pick really depends on your personal preferences, taste, health goals, and the other foods you eat that day. “All of these seafood options can fit into a healthy diet when enjoyed in balanced portions,” Cuda says. There are four common add-ons that people typically put into seafood boils. These add-ons bring additional texture, flavor, and variation to a seafood boil so that it’s not all seafood! Let’s take a look at what add-ons are the healthiest. At seafood boil joints, corn is typically chunked and served on the cob in the same mix as your seafood. “Corn is a great addition,” Cuda says. Corn contains a fair amount of fiber and vitamin C ( 8 ), which help with digestion and immune support, according to Cuda. If you’re looking for some carbohydrates to supplement your protein in seafood, corn may be a good option. Potatoes are the other common produce item found in seafood boils, usually served whole or halved. Cuda calls potatoes a “solid choice,” as they offer fiber and potassium to assist heart health and muscle function ( 9 ). While sausage can be flavorful and tasty, Cuda recommends using it sparingly as it tends to be higher in sodium and fat ( 10 ). Because seafood boils already have a fair amount of sodium in them (both in the seafood and the sauces), you might want to be mindful of your sausage portions and save them for a different meal instead. Who doesn’t love eggs? Hard boiled eggs are a nutritious choice, as they’re packed with protein, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E ( 11 ). Their more neutral taste can also help offset the saltiness of other seafood boil flavors.  About the Expert Lauren Cuda, RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Dietetics from Missouri State University and her master’s degree in Nutrition Diagnostics from Cox College. With over 10 years of experience, she specializes in pediatric nutrition, malnutrition, and nutrition support. If you’re cooking your own seafood boil, you obviously need to create a flavorful mix of seasonings to cook your ingredients in. At the same time, it’s important to be mindful of sodium content when choosing a seasoning. Some seasonings and spices that boost flavor without adding too much salt are: These seasonings and spices will penetrate into the seafood to add extra punch. If you’re opting for commercial blends such as Cajun seasoning, Cuda recommends using low-sodium versions when possible. Or, make your own blend so you can control the salt, she says. If you’ve ever had seafood boil before, you probably know that most people will dip their seafood in garlic butter sauce. But is this the most health-conscious choice? “Butter-based sauces are flavorful, but they’re also high in saturated fat and calories,” says Cuda. “While they can be part of a balanced meal, it’s helpful to use them in moderation.” Cuda recommends substituting butter-based sauces with a yogurt-based dip, vinegar-based dip, or an herb-infused olive oil. These sauces will still bring a flavor punch, but with healthier fats or additional protein. Here’s some ways to make these alternative dipping sauces: There are many great options for building a healthy seafood boil order, but what really matters is building a balanced plate and paying attention to sodium intake . Aim to select seafood that naturally has less sodium, limit the added salt in your boil base, and be mindful of the dipping sauce you use. At the end of the day, a seafood boil meal is an experience. Prioritize your own taste preferences and really choose what you will enjoy eating!  The information in this article is provided solely for informational purposes.

Her areas of focus include metabolism, gut health, obesity and weight management. When it comes to tart fillings, choosing between sweet potato and pumpkin is really a win-win because both are highly nutritious. Sweet potatoes, however, offer much more fiber, a little more protein, magnesium and vitamin C than pumpkin ( 1 , 2 ). This easy, quick-to-make tart is ideal for holiday gatherings, where the main feast may leave little room for dessert. Just a small slice, with its creamy filling and gingery crust, is sure to satisfy. Be sure not to skip the yogurt topping (the bits of candied ginger echo the ginger flavor in the crust). You can make the tart and the topping a day ahead and serve chilled or at room temperature. Active time: 15 minutes | Total time: 45 minutes Ingredients Directions Preheat oven to 350°F (180ºC).In a food processor, pulse the gingersnap cookies until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the crumb mixture firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Bake for 8 minutes, or until the crust is set. Remove from the oven and set aside. Rinse and dry the bowl of the food processor. Add the sweet potato, evaporated milk, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Process until smooth. Add the eggs and pulse just until combined; do not overmix. Pour the filling into the warm crust. Return the tart to the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the filling is set. Remove the tart from the oven and let cool slightly. Carefully remove the tart from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. To make the topping: In a medium bowl, stir together the yogurt, candied ginger, and honey until well combined.

If you’ve recently been online, you’ve probably heard of or seen the “ fisherman aesthetic ” or “ sardine girl summer ” memes. And if you haven’t, think: vacation in Italy, blocky artwork, soft color palettes, and—of course—tinned fish. Tinned (or canned) fish is a budget-friendly protein that is making an online comeback. With pics of high design tins stuffed with sardines going viral, it’s only natural that people will want to try incorporating tinned fish into their diets. But along with the hype of tinned fish also comes some criticism. Some worry that tinned fish is too high in sodium, preservatives, mercury, and BPA. If you’ve seen both the hype and the anxiety online, you might be wondering if tinned fish is really safe to eat. We’ve got answers. Tinned fish is a shelf stable protein that can provide a host of beneficial nutrients. The most common types of tinned fish include: Tinned fish is full of omega-3 fatty acids . Omega-3s are polyunsaturated fats that your body does not produce enough of on its own, making it an essential nutrient ( 1 ). According to MyFitnessPal dietitian Katherine Basbaum, omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation and support brain health. Tinned fish is also a good source of protein . 100 g of canned salmon contains 23 g of protein ( 2 ), which is comparable to most other meats. Protein is important for a number of different bodily functions, with its main role being to provide the body’s building blocks ( 3 ). Aside from omega-3s and protein, tinned fish provides useful vitamins and minerals . It is high in calcium, a nutrient that is critical for bone health ( 4 ). Tinned fish also has high potassium, magnesium, vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin D, and more ( 2 ). About the Expert Katherine Basbaum, MS, RD is Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She received her Masters in Nutrition Communication from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University and completed her Dietetic Internship at UVA Health, where she also works as a nutrition counselor for cardiology patients. While there are many benefits to consuming tinned fish, recent internet discourse has brought up some concerns about how safe the stuff is. Tinned fish may be high in sodium due to canning and preservation techniques. “If you are watching your sodium intake, make sure to look at the ingredients list when shopping for tinned fish since some products will have added sodium while others will not,” Basbaum says. Processed food gets a bad rap in comparison to fresh, whole foods. Oftentimes, processed food is full of preservatives to keep it shelf stable. Yet, tinned fish generally does not need additional preservatives to keep it long-lasting ( 5 ). The high-heat and pressure treatment involved in the canning process keeps tinned fish safe to eat without the need for added preservatives. Almost all fish contain trace amounts of mercury, so it’s not a matter of canned fish having more mercury than fresh fish—it’s about the type of fish you eat. According to Basbaum, most common types of tinned fish tend to contain low levels of mercury , making them safe to eat regularly. “However, when it comes to tuna and mackerel, some species do contain high levels of mercury and are best to avoid,” Basbaum says, specifically noting bigeye tuna and king mackerel. Check out this reference chart from the FDA/EPA to see what fish have the lowest levels of mercury. Bisphenol A, better known as BPA, is a chemical component often found in food packaging ( 6 ). “According to the Food and Drug Administration, BPA presence in food packaging is considered safe , as only very small amounts of BPA can migrate from food packaging to the food itself,” Basbaum says. On the other hand, other organizations oppose the FDA’s stance on BPA—so the topic is a bit up in the air. When selecting a tinned fish, Basbaum recommends selecting a can packed in water , with a fish that is high in omega-3s and low in mercury . Tinned fish packed in oil contains more calories than fish packed in water. Additionally, if fish are canned in oil, some of the healthy omega-3 fats in the fish can migrate into the surrounding oil ( 7 ) and be lost when the fish is drained. This may not be an issue if you use the flavorful oil in whatever you’re making. “Unless someone is looking for a particular flavor or texture from oil-packed tinned fish, I’d recommend the water-packed,” Basbaum says. Basbaum also says that the best tinned fish to eat are those highest in omega-3s and lowest in mercury ( 8 ). These fish include: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that you eat at least 8 ounces of seafood per week ( 9 ). This guideline is for a 2,000 calorie diet, so numbers can vary depending on the person. Tinned fish can be a good seafood choice to contribute to this 8-ounce benchmark. Although there are small nutritional differences between tinned fish and fresh fish, they are overall pretty similar ( 2 , 10 ). They are both excellent sources of omega-3s, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Basbaum does not recommend one over the other. Tinned fish is already fully cooked and ready to eat. But, Basbaum says that in order to best preserve omega-3 fatty acids, it is best not to overdo it with high-heat cooking methods ( 11 ). Canned fish and tinned fish are the same thing, but tinned fish sometimes refers to more gourmet versions. Despite some nutrition concerns, tinned fish is a healthy source of omega-3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. It offers nutrients comparable to fresh fish—and might come with a more tasty or aesthetic appeal. When it comes to whether you should eat tinned fish or fresh fish, Basbaum says, “I would not recommend one over the other. Instead, I’d say whichever one will get you to eat more fish, go for that kind!” What matters isn’t the form your fish comes in, but the fact that you’re eating seafood in the first place.

With a buttery whole-grain shortbread crust and a crunchy, sweet-salty fruit-and-nut topping, these little gems are a perfect treat to share during the holidays. Dried cranberries are a good source of fiber (4g per 1/2 cup) but because they are naturally tart, many brands are loaded with added sugar ( 1 ). Fortunately, there are brands of dried cranberries that contain less added sugar or are sweetened with apple juice. Read labels carefully and you can cut the added sugar. Active time: 25 minutes | Total time: 1 hour, plus cooling time For the crust For the filling Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) . Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two opposite sides to create a sling for easy removal. To make the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Pulse a few times to blend. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, with butter pieces no larger than a lentil, about 20 pulses. Add the vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of water. Pulse 5 times, or just until the dough begins to clump together. The mixture should hold together easily when pressed between your fingers. If it feels too dry, add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, pulsing briefly after each addition. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside. To make the filling:In a medium bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, melted butter, egg, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth. Stir in the chopped walnuts and dried cranberries. Pour the filling evenly over the warm crust. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the filling is bubbly and the nuts are lightly browned.

With largely preventable diet-related diseases among the top causes of death and economic burden in the U.S., integrating nutrition into medical training is essential to preparing future clinicians and reversing these trends. As the leading scientific society focused on nutrition research and practice, ASN has evidence-based nutrition resources to equip physicians and other health care professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to provide sound nutrition advice. Current resources and tools are available at nutrition.org/resources-for-healthcare-providers . “The American Society for Nutrition has long supported the need for more nutrition education in medical schools and applauds this important initiative. Physicians and all health care professionals must have accurate nutrition knowledge to help Americans live healthier lives,” said John E. Courtney, Ph.D., ASN Chief Executive Officer. “ASN has advocated for the establishment of a coordinating center to align stakeholders, centralize resources, and strengthen training opportunities. Our organization is well positioned to provide the nutrition expertise and tools that medical schools and residency programs need to integrate meaningful nutrition education into their curricula.” ASN is committed to working with educators, health systems, policymakers, and health care professionals to ensure that nutrition education is incorporated and sustained throughout medical training. Physicians should be equipped to recognize nutrition-related needs, provide basic counseling, and refer patients to registered dietitians (RDs/RDNs)for more specialized, in-depth care. Working together, health care teams can better prevent and manage chronic diseases and improve patient outcomes through optimal nutrition. For physicians seeking to further expand their nutrition expertise, the National Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists (NBPNS) offers credentialing through an independent assessment and certification process. Earning certification as a Physician Nutrition Specialist demonstrates a physician’s advanced competency in clinical nutrition.

This diversity is the fundamental strength of our professional society. Through this member spotlight series , we celebrate our diversity and the vast achievements made by our members in the field. Meet Dr. Christos Katsanos, Associate Professor at Arizona State University, Adjunct Faculty at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and an ASN member for 18 years. In a conversation with ASN’s Member Engagement Coordinator, Sara Genell, he reflects on what sparked his interest in exercise physiology, the vital role nutrition science has played in his career, and his active involvement with ASN. As 2024–25 Chair of the Energy and Macronutrient Metabolism (EMM) Research Interest Section, Dr. Katsanos helped lead the EMM GEM Forum Meeting the Nutritional Needs of Patients on Anti-Obesity Medications: What’s New? at NUTRITION 2025. He also shared his perspective as Guest Editor for the upcoming joint special issue of The Journal of Nutrition and The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition on Nutritional Considerations in the Era of Emerging Obesity Medications , highlighting the types of submissions he hopes to see. Sara Genell: Thank you, Dr. Katsanos, for joining me today for this interview. For our readers who have not yet met you,  can you please introduce yourself and share what sparked your interest in exercise physiology and macronutrient metabolism? Dr. Christos Katsanos : Thank you, Sara, for this opportunity to speak directly to the ASN Membership Community. I am an Associate Professor at Arizona State University and an Adjunct Faculty at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. I have always been fascinated by the human body and its remarkable ability to adapt to exercise, which led me to focus my graduate training on exercise science. Alongside this, I have long been interested in how nutrition contributes to promoting health and preventing disease, and how exercise may impact nutrient metabolism. Thus, while my formal graduate work was in exercise physiology, nutrition has always been an integral part of my research, and for my doctoral work I studied postprandial metabolism of dietary fat in response to exercise. Genell: As someone with formal training in exercise science, how did you hear about ASN and what led you to joining as a member? Dr. Katsanos : I have been a member of ASN since 2007 and attended my first annual meeting, at the time as part of the Experimental Biology meetings, during my postdoctoral training. I had the opportunity to present my research on the role of amino acid supplementation in regulating protein metabolism in older adults. From that experience, ASN felt like a natural professional home, offering an ideal venue to present my research and engage with colleagues who share similar scientific interests. Genell: We are so fortunate to have you heavily involved within the ASN Community. One avenue in particular is through your leadership as the Chair for the Energy and Macronutrient Metabolism (EMM) GEM. You served during the 2024-2025 term and are now past-chair. What inspired you to become further involved as EMM Gem Chair? Dr. Katsanos : Over the years, I came to appreciate the importance of having a voice in shaping scientific agendas and supporting initiatives that advance our field. Serving as a GEM Chair provides an opportunity to do exactly that, while also strengthening connections with both established leaders and emerging scientists. It allows to further develop leadership, organizational, and communication skills that are essential in both academia and the broader scientific community. Given that ASN has been instrumental in my own professional growth, the GEM position offers a meaningful way to give back by contributing my time and expertise to help the Society continue to thrive. Genell: Can you speak a little bit about the EMM Gem Forum: ‘Meeting the Nutritional Needs of Patients on Anti-Obesity Medications: What’s New? ‘ that you chaired at NUTRITION 2025? What do you think were the biggest takeaways for folks who may have missed this session? Dr. Katsanos : This session was timely given how transformative the latest generation of obesity medications have been by producing unprecedented weight loss and significant improvements in health outcomes. However, one of the big gaps in the field is that we know surprisingly little about dietary intake, nutrient status, and optimal nutrition strategies for individuals on these medications. The session discussed how to ensure long-term health benefit by integrating nutrition strategies we currently are familiar with, largely as part of other weight loss interventions, directly into this obesity pharmacotherapy. A highlight of the session was the overview of the recent multi-society advisory, “Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity”, which ASN co-endorsed, and which synthesizes current knowledge in the area of nutrition for patients on the new obesity medications. One of the biggest takeaways was that there is an urgent need for evidence-based nutrition and lifestyle guidance tailored to patients on obesity medications. The consensus was that in order to maximize health outcomes, these treatments must be accompanied by well-structured nutrition strategies that address emerging challenges and ensure patients not only lose weight but also maintain muscle mass, bone health, and overall metabolic well-being. Genell: In addition to your time dedicated to the EMM GEM, y ou are a guest editor of a joint special issue between The Journal of Nutrition and The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition on the topic of Nutrition Considerations in the Era of Emerging Obesity Medications. Can you share a little about the submissions you are hoping to receive? Dr. Katsanos : This special issue is a natural extension of the EMM GEM forum held at NUTRITION 2025, highlighting the urgent need for evidence-based nutrition and lifestyle guidance for individuals using the new obesity medications. We invite authors to submit work that explores dietary patterns, assesses nutritional status, describes macro- and micronutrient metabolism and requirements, evaluates supplementation effectiveness, and outlines strategies to address emerging nutritional challenges and improve health outcomes in this patient population. Authors are encouraged to consider either of these journals as the best fit for their submissions. Genell : What motivated you to help lead this joint special issue? Dr. Katsanos : Besides aligning closely with my research interests, I was inspired to help lead this special issue because it addresses a critical and timely gap in literature. The use of new obesity medications is increasing rapidly, yet we still lack a comprehensive understanding of nutrition’s role in this modern era. I hope this issue will unite contributions from both basic science and clinical research, ultimately filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the field. By opening submissions to two of the society’s flagship journals, one focused on basic research and the other more on clinical studies, this special issue creates a platform that provides the opportunity to publish original and review articles spanning from bench to bedside. Genell: Thank you for your insight into the special issue. I hope our readers feel motivated to submit their original or review work. To wrap up, can you leave some advice to our Early Career investigator readers who are looking to get more involved in ASN? Dr. Katsanos : I would recommend them to start by attending and presenting at the ASN annual meeting. This is key to gain visibility, receive feedback, and expand your network. Join an ASN Interest Group that aligns with your research and professional goals, as it provides direct connections with colleagues and opens the door to leadership opportunities. And don’t forget to take advantage of ASN’s year-round resources, including webinars, and volunteering opportunities, to stay engaged beyond the annual meeting.

This diversity is the fundamental strength of our professional society. Through this member spotlight series , we celebrate our diversity and the vast achievements made by our members in the field. Meet ASN’s 2025–2026 President, Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa, PhD, DFASN, FTOS, FAHA. A dedicated ASN member since 1994, Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa has served the Society in numerous leadership roles, including Director At-Large for the Nutrition Science Mechanisms Research Interest Section, as well as on various committees and in other GEM leadership positions. Earlier this year, she was inducted into the 2025 Class of Distinguished Fellows of ASN (DFASN), the highest honor awarded by the Society. Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa officially began her term on June 18, 2025, succeeding Sarah L. Booth, PhD, who now serves as Past President. We first spotlighted Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa’s work in 2023, and in the following interview, ASN’s Member Engagement Coordinator, Sara Genell, reconnects with her to discuss her presidential priorities and vision for ASN. Sara Genell : Thank you, Dr. Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa, for participating in this member spotlight interview. Your interview from December 2023 introduced you, your background, and involvement with ASN, so for this interview, I’d like to focus on your presidential priorities, if that’s alright with you. Dr. Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa : Hi Sara, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the Society. Let’s dive right in. Genell : Great! To begin, can you highlight a couple of your presidential priorities and how you plan to achieve them during your term? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : Two of my presidential priorities relate to expanding and strengthening global partnerships. While ASN is US-based, it is a global society as its members come from 115 countries from around the world.  We already have several ongoing partnerships with international nutrition societies or associations that I have been working on with ASN staff, especially with Senior Vice President, Business Development and Sales, Dante Preciado, and our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. John Courtney. One of my priorities will focus specifically on partnerships with Africa and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries, and South America, as well as engaging with specific international organizations interested in nutrition science and/or food systems such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).  To do so, I am actively communicating and engaging with leaders from these organizations to identify effective collaborations of mutual interest that advance nutrition science and benefit our members.  My other relevant priority with a global reach is to expand ASN’s role in advocacy, policy and education in the US and abroad to support its members. An important goal here is to advocate for nutrition research and education nationally and globally, with emphasis on developing the nutrition workforce and our future leaders, and to advocate for the importance of appropriate funding and training to support this nutrition workforce.  ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer, Sarah Ohlhorst, has already been doing exceptional work in nutrition policy and advocacy, and I look forward to working with her to further advance this area. These partnerships add value to our members, support the ASN 2028 Vision , and increase ASN’s role as a premier nutrition society, as we provide opportunities for ASN members locally, regionally and internationally, to collaborate, share mentoring opportunities, and increase nutrition knowledge across the globe. These priorities will engage our ASN members from private, government and academic institutions in the US and worldwide, across the different areas of nutrition research, education, and practice. Genell : Are there any specific initiatives or programs you’d like to implement or expand upon during your term? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : I have continued to attend ASN meetings since 1994, from the EB meetings to NUTRITION meetings and I enjoy learning from the breadth of nutrition research and practice being presented during our flagship annual meeting.  However, there is also great value in interacting in smaller groups around specific topics of interest to various members, especially for our early career members.  Such opportunities will reengage more basic science researchers in ASN. For this reason, I will be working with ASN members, staff and the Board of Directors to develop regional conferences and workshops on specific topics related to nutrition. Professional development activities for early- and mid-career members will also be included. This will be achieved by working with ASN members, GEMs and ASN staff, namely Gwen Twillman, ASN’s Chief Programs and Advancement Officer and Felicia Price, ASN’s Chief Administration Officer and ASN Foundation (ASNF) Executive Director. Besides GEMs, other important partners in this initiative include the Academic Nutrition Departments and Programs (ANDP) Community , our Sustaining Partners (SP) , and various relevant nutrition-related professional societies and organizations. Given the cost involved, this will also require exploring revenue opportunities for sustainability of new and existing conferences through grants, sponsorship and other financial support. Specialized conferences such as these could also be organized as pre- or post- NUTRITION events, as well as incorporated into the annual meeting schedule for maximal involvement.  I envision that this will increase overall member participation in areas of interest to them, reengage and increase involvement of basic scientists but also other areas of nutrition science and practice. I look forward to hearing from ASN members who are interested in helping organize or participate in these scientific conferences and programs. Genell: Speaking of our annual NUTRITION meeting, you have transitioned into your Presidential term just after our flagship annual meeting, NUTRITION 2025. What were your biggest takeaways from the meeting this year, in terms of trends and/or the state of the field? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa: NUTRITION 2025 was a great conference highlighting state-of-the-art science, from basic, translation, and clinical research to community/population research, policy and practice. There was a wealth of information and new knowledge presented. A few important topics remain present and relevant year after year ranging from maternal-child health, and prenatal nutrition to various bioactive compounds that improve health. This year at NUTRITION 2025, we had two new award lectures through partnership of the ASNF and the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) that sponsored these awards, which funded two exceptional scientists: the 2025 ASNF-NNF Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches in Childhood Obesity by Dr. Andrew Agbaje, University of Eastern Finland, and the 2025 ASNF-NNF Henrik Dam Award for foundational and translational nutrition research by Dr. Julia L. Finkelstein from Cornell University. The Opening Session highlighted another timely topic on food security and food access during periods of emergencies, natural disaster and war situations and the importance of attending to nutritional needs during such challenging situations across the lifespan. The importance and role of the gut microbiome and gut health in health and disease remained a key topic this year as well, with several presentations on rigorous approaches in this field, from methodologies, data collection and analyses to interpretation to impact. Other timely lectures highlighted where ASN members and the nutrition field can make a difference. This specifically pertained to anti-obesity drugs (GLP1-RA), that often come with potential malnutrition, thus the importance of raising awareness of the nutritional needs and requirements of patients on these effective medications. Last but not least, I am very proud to see ASN continuing to support and engage early career scientists, especially during these challenging times for the workforce in academia or government. There were many presentations and award competitions across the nutrition areas by early career members and many professional and career development activities, some of which were supported by our SPs. Genell: ASN’s membership covers all career stages and many disciplines within nutrition science. How do you recommend members get involved with the Society to grow their networks and careers? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : Nutrition is a very broad multi- and trans-disciplinary field. I highly encourage ASN members to maximize their participation in ASN and ASN conferences which provide an opportunity to learn about many relevant topics that may help them further elevate the work they do. Some members may only attend sessions related to their specific research at NUTRITION conferences, but by doing so they are missing opportunities to potentially expand their work into new and novel directions.  Poster sessions and networking events are great opportunities to meet potential new mentors and collaborators from across the globe and increase our knowledge. There are many opportunities to volunteer in GEMs . This is how I started my involvement in ASN back in the 1990s. I joined the Nutrient-Gene Interactions Research Interest Section (NGI RIS) back when I was a new assistant professor. Through the NGI RIS, I met many colleagues and collaborators that enriched my career and shaped my research trajectory; I also went on to serve as Chair of the NGI RIS and continued to be involved in ASN in various scientific and leadership capacities. Genell: Thinking back to your interview with us from December 2023, how has your perspective evolved, if at all, now that you are stepping into this new role as ASN President? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : Increasingly, we all realize that our world is very interconnected, as highlighted most recently by the COVID-19 pandemic.  I firmly believe that exchange and sharing of knowledge is very important. Scientists do this, but this exchange becomes even more valuable when shared across the globe, not just within one country or one region. At the current time, nutrition is an even more critical area to advance, not only within human nutrition or food science but also through integrating the One Health approach to understand how our interactions with animals affect our health and nutritional status, and how environmental contaminants or pollutants such as PFAS and microplastics, or extreme weather conditions such as drought and floodings or natural disasters affect human health (and animal health) and how nutritional status may contribute to the spread of or aggravate infectious diseases. Situations may be different from one region or country to another, but we can learn from each other through exchange of information and knowledge. That is why you see One Health as one of my priorities. Genell: You are the executive director of the Institute for One Health Innovation. In what ways will you bring a One Health perspective to leading ASN? Why do you feel it is important to take a One Health lens when conducting nutrition research? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : One of my priorities is to raise awareness about the importance of the One Health approach in nutrition research, education and practice.   One Health is the most sustainable approach to achieve optimal health for all, by recognizing that the health of animals, humans, plants and ecosystems are closely connected and intertwined, and we must view health and healthcare more holistically.  One Health integrates disciplines from basic nutrition and food sciences, or plant and animal sciences, to environmental health to solve challenges in our food systems that impact human nutrition and health. Towards this goal, we recently published an editorial on Advancing One Health in The Journal of Nutrition where we also announced a special issue on One Health inviting ASN members to showcase their research in this area.  The editorial provides some additional examples of the intricate role of One Health in human nutrition and health. An example that many can relate to are food systems and agricultural production and practices, focused on the role of soil health in human health; specifically, how soil quality and microbial composition impacts crops’ (food) nutritional value and content, which in turn affects animal or human health. We also know that conditions such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, and other environmental factors can change these interactions. These are all current and continuing challenges that require multidisciplinary experts to work together and contribute the expertise needed to solve these challenges. In addition to this special issue, I look forward to more programming by ASN on the topic of One Health including at NUTRITION 2026 and throughout the year. These activities further support ASN’s 2028 vision, ASN journals’ reach and visibility, and provide opportunities for more collaboration with industry, animal, food and environmental sciences and agricultural disciplines and organizations. Genell: How do you think (or hope) the field of nutrition science and practice will evolve in the next 10 years? What is ASN’s role in this evolution? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : We have seen the increased prevalence of emerging infectious diseases but also the sustained increase in non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes; and these will continue to pose economic and health burdens. Nutrition research may be at the center of solving these challenges. We have made significant progress in the past decade towards precision and individualized nutrition through the development of sophisticated omics tools and nutritional assessment tools. However, much work remains to be done to achieve true precision nutrition. We still rely on self-reported data, and many advanced methods used in the clinic are not always easily transposable to the community. Methodologies have been improved to more accurately measure food intake and assess biomarkers of health including research on gut microbiota or their metabolites that affect health. However, implementation of these advances at the community level are not there yet and much remains to be done on translating findings from microbiome research into therapies.  I anticipate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play an increasingly greater role in implementing precision nutrition and in translating and accelerating research applications into clinical practice.  As mentioned above, emerging infectious diseases are major threats, and we do not fully understand the role of nutrition deficiencies or malnutrition on the spread of these diseases in animals or humans. Genell: Thank you again, Dr. Moustaïd -Moussa, for addressing our Society through this spotlight interview. Are there any closing remarks or call to action you would like to leave with the ASN members reading this interview? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : ASN has had a great impact on my career and professional development, and I highly encourage our members, especially early- and mid-career members, to actively engage in ASN and help guide and shape the future vision of ASN and nutrition research, education and practice.  This is such an important time for nutrition science, as our field plays an increasingly critical role in shaping national and global health. ASN members have a big responsibility to ensure that we are guided by evidence-based nutrition. We must also communicate what we do to our stakeholders and policymakers. Related to my priorities , I look forward to hearing feedback from our members and partners, and to see them engaged not only in these priorities, as relevant, but overall to advance nutrition science and the ASN 2028 vision to achieve a healthier world through nutrition.

Washington, D.C. (May 30, 2025) – Four leading organizations in lifestyle medicine, obesity medicine, and nutrition—the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), the American Society for Nutrition (ASN), the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA), and The Obesity Society (TOS)—have jointly released a clinical advisory titled “Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity.” Published across four peer-reviewed journals, this consensus-based guidance reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration to help clinicians support patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity care with evidence-based nutritional and behavioral strategies. GLP-1 therapies, including both single and combination agents, have emerged as powerful tools in the management of obesity, demonstrating average placebo-adjusted weight reductions of 5–18% in clinical trials , along with improvements in metabolic, functional and cardiovascular outcomes. However, sustaining these benefits over time and maximizing patient outcomes require comprehensive care that integrates lifestyle intervention—particularly nutrition therapy—into the treatment plan. “GLP-1s represent an important advancement in obesity care,” said lead author and advisory chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, of Tufts University. “But these medications can present challenges, including gastrointestinal side effects, risk of micronutrient deficiencies, muscle and bone loss, poor long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain, and high costs; and, on their own, are not enough. Nutrition therapy and lifestyle support are essential components to address these challenges, help patients maximize and maintain health gains over time, and ensure we are using these drugs wisely, effectively, and without bankrupting the healthcare system.” The advisory outlines eight key nutritional priorities to support patients on GLP-1 medications, emphasizing the importance of (1) patient-centered initiation of therapy, (2) careful baseline nutritional assessment, (3) management of gastrointestinal side effects, (4) personalized, nutrient-dense, minimally processed diets, (5) prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (6) adequate protein intake and strength training to preserve lean mass, (7) leveraging a good diet to maximize weight reduction, and (8) promoting other lifestyle changes around activity, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections to maximize long-term success. Recent evidence supports this integrative model. In studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions, patients receiving both GLP-1 therapy and structured nutrition guidance achieved greater weight loss, better adherence, and were more likely to sustain weight loss after discontinuing medication compared to those receiving pharmacotherapy alone (Jastreboff et al., 2022; Wadden et al., 2023; White et al., 2023; Wilding et al., 2021; Wilding et al., 2022; Wilding et al., 2023). Despite the known benefits, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s do not currently receive adequate nutritional counseling or behavioral support. This advisory seeks to fill that gap with practical, interdisciplinary guidance for implementation in clinical practice. While certain considerations—such as GI tolerance and micronutrient balance—are important for clinicians to address, the advisory emphasizes that a proactive lifestyle-based approach can mitigate risks and optimize outcomes. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise worldwide, the integration of nutrition therapy into GLP-1-based care offers a scalable strategy to extend the clinical and economic value of these therapies. The joint advisory is simultaneously published in the following scholarly journals: ● American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) ● The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (ASN) ● Obesity Pillars® (OMA) ● Obesity (TOS) Clinicians are encouraged to use the advisory’s tools and frameworks to help patients translate nutrition guidance into sustainable behaviors, making lifestyle medicine an active ingredient in every “prescription” for obesity care.

Supporting quotes: “GLP-1s are transforming the treatment of obesity, with immense potential for weight loss and improving health outcomes,” said Jasdeep Saluja, MD, FRCPC, DipABLM, DipABOM, chair of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine’s GLP-1 Task Force. “This joint advisory offers practical priorities for incorporating nutritional and other lifestyle treatments into GLP-1 therapy to maximize effectiveness, obtain more equitable outcomes, and optimize cost-effectiveness in the real world. As clinicians navigate the shifting care landscape for obesity, we hope this information empowers them to manage potential pitfalls, such as gastrointestinal side effects, nutritional needs, and preserving skeletal and muscular body mass.” “GLP-1s are reshaping the landscape of obesity treatment, but it’s clear that medication alone is not a complete solution,” stated John E. Courtney, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of the American Society for Nutrition. “This consensus-based guidance highlights the critical role of nutrition in supporting patients on GLP-1 therapy, with clear recommendations for health care providers to optimize outcomes, reduce risks, and fill urgent gaps in care through practical, evidence-informed nutrition strategies.” “As an obesity specialist grounded in both lifestyle and culinary medicine, I see food not just as fuel, but as a foundational tool in clinical care,” stated Lydia Alexander, MD, DABOM, DABLM, MFOMA, Immediate Past President of the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA). “GLP-1 therapies are powerful, but they’re most effective when paired with intentional, nutrient-dense eating patterns that support metabolic health and long-term success. Nutrition is not an afterthought—it’s a therapeutic partner that helps patients sustain weight loss, preserve lean mass, and translate medication-driven progress into lasting well-being.” “Medical therapy for obesity and lifestyle changes go and-in-hand,” stated Marc-Andre Cornier, MD, FTOS, president of The Obesity Society. “This guidance lays a nutrition roadmap to help providers support their patients on sustainable and lasting weight reduction journeys. It underscores the importance of nutrition on quality of life, and is an important contribution to the literature about incorporating lifestyle interventions into obesity care.” About the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) is the nation’s medical professional society advancing the field of lifestyle medicine as the foundation of a redesigned, value-based and equitable healthcare delivery system, essential to achieving the Quintuple Aim and whole-person health.

Named in honor of trailblazing Danish researchers Henrik Dam and Flemming Quaade, these prestigious new awards aim to spark innovation and support the next generation of leaders in nutrition science. Julia Finkelstein, ScD, MPH, a globally recognized expert in vitamin B 12 and one-carbon metabolism, has been selected as the inaugural recipient of the Henrik Dam Award for Scientific Discovery in Nutrition , which honors mid-career professionals for outstanding research contributions to the understanding of micronutrients, nutritional status, and/or metabolism. She is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at the Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Director of the Maternal and Child Nutrition Program at Cornell University. Dr. Finkelstein’s groundbreaking research has demonstrated a high global burden of vitamin B 12 deficiency in women of reproductive age and identified a critical role of periconceptional vitamin B 12 in maternal and child health. Through population-based biomarker surveillance, longitudinal cohort studies, and randomized clinical trials, this work has informed evidence-based interventions and policy to improve the health of women and children. With methodological rigor, Dr. Finkelstein’s work has influenced clinical guidelines and nutrition policy globally, including through collaborations with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Dr. Sander Kersten, the Director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences said, “We are thrilled that Dr. Finkelstein is the inaugural recipient of this new award. It is incredibly well-deserved and recognition of her research and its global impact.” In addition to her scientific achievements, Dr. Finkelstein has demonstrated a deep commitment to mentorship and capacity strengthening globally, including NIH training programs in nutrition and maternal and child health, and the development of Cochrane and nutrition research methods courses that have equipped hundreds of health professionals in low- and middle-income settings with critical research skills. The award includes a research grant of 1.7 million Danish kroner (DKK) (~$240,000 USD); a personal award of 300,000 DKK (~$42,000 USD); a grant to host a symposium at her home institution; and an invited plenary lecture at NUTRITION 2025 , the flagship meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, taking place May 31–June 3, 2025, in Orlando, Florida. Andrew Agbaje, MD, MPH, PhD, FACC, FESC, FHAA, FNYAM has been named the first recipient of the Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches to Childhood Obesity , honoring early-career physicians who have made exceptional contributions to obesity prevention or management. He currently serves as Associate Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and Child Health at the University of Eastern Finland. Dr. Agbaje’s groundbreaking research has shown that waist circumference-to-height ratio is a more accurate predictor of obesity and metabolic diseases than the traditional Body Mass Index (BMI). He recently launched a clinical calculator based on this metric, offering a potentially transformative tool for the early detection and management of childhood obesity. Dr. Agbaje discovered arterial stiffness as a novel risk factor for pediatric obesity and insulin resistance and was recently named the world’s third-best highly ranked scholar in the arterial stiffness specialty. His work has further revealed adolescence as the critical window for interrupting the fat mass-insulin resistance pathologic cycle. Notably, he has demonstrated that light-intensity physical activity is a highly effective strategy for reversing excessive fat accumulation caused by sedentary behavior in childhood. Dr. Agbaje has served as an expert advisor to the World Health Organization’s committee on childhood obesity prevention. Award benefits include a research grant of 500,000 DKK (~$70,000 USD) and a travel stipend to present a lecture at NUTRITION 2025 . “It is with great pleasure that we congratulate the first two winners of the ASNF-NNF awards. These awards aim to acknowledge early and mid-career professionals for their innovative research within the growing field of nutritional science and health,” expressed Arne Astrup, Professor, MD, DMSc, and Senior Vice President of Obesity and Nutrition Science at the Novo Nordisk Foundation. “Eighty-two years after Henrik Dam received the Nobel prize for his work on Vitamin K, Dr. Finkelstein receives the inaugural ASNF-NNF Henrik Dam Award for her pioneering work on B 12 , hence demonstrating the continued importance of micronutrient research. Nutrition is fundamental to our overall health, and prioritizing research in this field will impact health globally. We look forward to celebrating the winners’ remarkable contributions to the nutrition field at NUTRITION 2025.” Both award lectures will be streamed live through the NUTRITION 2025 Digital Pass . For more information on how to view the lectures, visit nutrition.org/meeting/digital-pass . These awards are part of a multi-year partnership between the ASNF and NNF to recognize rising stars in nutrition research and accelerate breakthroughs in global health. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has committed funding for the awards through 2027 and plays no role in the selection of recipients. “The work of Drs. Finkelstein and Agbaje exemplifies the scientific impact we aim to recognize with these awards. Expanding the evidence base to bridge knowledge gaps and support nutrition interventions is critical,” stated Paul M.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? When it comes to finding new ways to improve your overhead pressing technique, sometimes you've gotta Z it to believe it. Joking aside, the Z press might be one of those moves not every gymgoer is familiar with, but it’s arguably one of the best variations for reinforcing shoulder press form, according to Men’s Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. , and fitness editor Brett Williams, NASM-CPT . What makes it unique is that it’s done on the floor with both legs out in front of you — taking them completely out of the movement and allowing you to focus a whole lot more on core positioning. And of course, the Z press emphasizes pressing overhead without arching your back—especially important once you level up to heavier presses—when performed the right way. So how do you do The exercise correctly? According to Samuel, the best way to start is by going single arm, using a kettlebell—this makes setting up much easier than the awkwardness of having to pull a pair of dumbbells from the floor or wrangling a barbell. You'll be sitting on your butt for the Z press. As far as leg placement, either a wide or narrow base works—it’s more about finding what's comfortable for you, Samuel says. Get the kettlebell into a tight rack position, keeping your forearm perpendicular to the ground and maintaining tension in your shoulder blades. “Here's the strength of the Z press,” Samuel says. “Because our lower body is not part of the equation anymore, you get to think about making sure your abs are nice and tight.” Once that’s set, drive the weight straight up, making sure to get a little squeeze at the top. Samuel says to think about stacking your joints in this position—wrist above your elbow and elbow right above your shoulder, before lowering the weight back down into the rack position. The Z press makes a good first or second exercise in your shoulder or pressing workouts and can be done with either a kettlebell or dumbbell. Stick to about three sets of eight to 12 reps. Over time, you can try adding a heavier load to the move. “It's going to help you really reinforce good shoulder form as it’s going to help you build those shoulders,” Samuel says.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? KETTLEBELLS OFFER PLENTY of bang for your buck. You can use them for strength training , to build muscle , and for explosive movements like snatches and swings. And you can achieve any of these feats with just one kettlebell , making it a tool that’s as simple as it is effective. Not only that, but they are actually fun to use, I've put together plenty of grueling workouts with kettlebells that had me grinning from ear to ear at the end. If you want to get stronger, you’re going to need a kettlebell that’s heavier—and buying multiple bells can get pricey. Our favorite solution is the adjustable kettlebell, which like the best adjustable dumbells and the best weighted vests , are highly versatile pieces of equipment. Our editors researched and tested the most popular—and even lesser-known—adjustable kettlebells to find the six best worth considering for your own home gym . Most adjustable kettlebells have a weight range between 10 and 40 pounds. We looked for brands that offer either a wider range of weights in one kettlebell or multiple kettlebells with different weight ranges. For movements like swings, deadlifts, rows, and push presses, any weight under 40 pounds is too light to be challenging to anyone who isn’t a beginner. Ten to 30 pounds is great for isolation exercises (think curls, lateral raises, and extensions), but won’t pose a proper challenge for the explosive movements that people expect to perform with kettlebells. The handle of your kettlebell needs to be easy to grip, comfortable, and able to fit both of your hands for a variety of exercises. The size of the handle refers to both the diameter (measured in millimeters) and the width of the handle. A competition-grade kettlebell has a handle diameter of 190mm (or 7.5 inches). Unless you’re training specifically for kettlebell sport, you don’t need to worry about buying a kettlebell with those specific dimensions. In fact, some of our testers prefer handles that are thinner in diameter (they’re easier to grip) and wider in length (you can better grab it with both hands). That said, all the kettlebells on this list feature handles that our testers think are comfortable and effective and are millimeters within competition-grade specs. You want an adjustable kettlebell to look and function like a traditional kettlebell, so we mostly chose products that resemble single-weight kettlebells. That said, if there’s a pick on this list that strays from the traditional shape, it’s because we deemed it nonetheless comfortable and/or easy to use. You’re going to run into a handful of different changing mechanisms for the kettlebells below. The two most common are a dial and pin. For the dial, the kettlebell usually sits on top of a stack of plates. You turn the dial to the weight you want, and the mechanism automatically engages the appropriate number of weight plates. To use the pin, you’ll manually insert it into different holes in the kettlebell that correlate to a specific weight (it’s no different than using a weight stack at the gym). Both dials and pins are quick and efficient mechanisms. Dials are often made from plastic so they can be prone to breaking, but this is, in our experience, a rarity and likely won’t happen as long as you use your kettlebell sensibly. Competition-style kettlebells may require you to ratchet open the bell with a wrench and manually add or remove metal plate weights before closing it back up. This is a pain, but the trade off is more stability and durability, and an adjustable kettlebell that’s shaped like and performs like a traditional one. Kettlebell handles aren’t really kettlebells, but handles with an extended pole for you to load weights onto. This process shouldn’t feel too different from loading a barbell. Our team at Men’s Health , including a few certified trainers and former athletes, have used dozens of different models of adjustable kettlebells during our decades of work in the fitness industry. The building of this list was led by Fitness and Commerce Editor Charles Thorp, who started with the previous batch of best-performing models and then put them up against newly-released options, even unreleased options that we have received early access to. We also reached out to our large network of experts, including our Advisory Board , to share their insights and any new designs they've tried. We combined this expansive experience with targeted testing of the top contenders on the market, done along with the writer Andrew Gutman, from upcoming and established brands. During this testing these kettlebells during a wide range of workouts in a variety of environments, whether that was CrossFit WODs at our local box, kettlebell flows in the Men's Health studio gym, or HIIT workouts in our own garages. Look below to check out our favorite picks for every kind of athlete. Our list is competitive. Many iconic brands produce adjustable kettlebells with rave reviews and similar specs. What edged REP’s adjustable kettlebell into our Best Overall spot is that it looks, feels, and performs the most like a standard kettlebell —even the handle diameter is nearly competition-grade—and the price is very fair for the equipment you’re getting. Like nearly everything REP produces, the quality of this kettlebell is standard-setting. The frame is made from cast iron and powder-coated to enhance your grip. The traditional shape enables kettlebell athletes to use this kettlebell, so their training will transfer to competition. Even the bottom of the kettlebell is covered in rubber to protect your floor—a minor detail we appreciate. Typically, you’re paying above market for this level of quality and design, but REP’s adjustable kettlebell is less expensive than other picks on this list. REP offers three different weight ranges: 8-16kg (17-35lbs), 16-24kg (35-53lbs), and 10-40lbs. The kilogram kettlebells adjust in two-kilogram increments, and the kettlebells sold in pounds adjust in five-pound increments. To select your weight, you’ll turn the dial located on the top of the kettlebell (below the handle). You’ll then lift the kettlebell off the weight stack, where the remaining weight plates will sit for the duration of your set or workout. If you want to nitpick, other brands have said that the plastic dial feels cheap and prone to breaking. We want to highlight this detail, but our editors don’t think this is an issue unless you plan on abusing the kettlebell. No matter which weight range you choose, you’re replacing five kettlebells. For general fitness enthusiasts, we like the 10-40lb option; it’s enough weight to challenge you for presses and high-rep sets of squats and rows. If you have some lifting experience and want to primarily train explosive movements like swings and snatches, as one traditionally does with kettlebells, opt for the 16-24kg weight range. Unless you’re a complete beginner, we suggest those two weight ranges. Read More: The Best Kettlebells Bells of Steel created something very cool with this competition-spec adjustable kettlebell. The weight range and increments are fantastic, and the dimensions are exactly to competition spec. You’ll replace 18 kettlebells for less than $300. Two reasons why it’s not our best overall pick are that the adjustment process for this kettlebell is comparatively time-intensive, and a competition-style bell isn’t for everyone. To change the weights of the Bells of Steel kettlebell, you need a few minutes and a couple of tools. You’ll undo the bolt on the bottom of the kettlebell using an Allen wrench, remove the bottom half, and then loosen the other screw, which secures the plates, with a traditional wrench. You can then add more plates in half-kilogram increments to the bolt that runs through the top half of the shell. Because the adjustment process is more time-consuming, this isn’t the best kettlebell for circuits or workouts that demand you to change weights on the fly. At first glance, you probably can’t even tell this is an adjustable kettlebell; it has a smooth cast-iron finish, void of any dials or switches, and the 35-millimeter handle looks identical to standard competition kettlebells. This is the serious kettlebell athlete's adjustable kettlebell. That said, if you’ve never trained with an adjustable kettlebell, be aware that the stainless steel handle can rub the hand raw (use a lot of chalk), it’ll feel more cumbersome than other picks on this list, and the starting weight is over 24 pounds. This is a solid choice if you’re a kettlebell athlete or are looking for a heavier adjustable kettlebell (and you’re okay with the adjustment process). From the company that brought adjustable dumbbells into the mainstream, BowFlex’s SelectTech 840 adjustable kettlebell is a great entry-level model for the kettlebell-curious gym goer. It’s reasonably priced, replaces six kettlebells, and is simple to adjust on the fly. The SelecTtech 840 offers six different weights: Eight, 12, 20, 25, 35, and 40 pounds, enough weight to challenge you during isolation movements like curls and extensions while providing enough resistance for snatches, cleans, and rows. If you’ve been training with kettlebells for a few years, 40 pounds will likely be too light for you, so you’ll want to look for a kettlebell that offers a heavier top-end weight or consider buying two of this model. While it isn’t shaped exactly like a kettlebell, it feels enough like one that anyone who uses a traditional kettlebell won’t be completely thrown off. The dial located on the top of the kettlebell makes adjusting between weights a breeze, and the handle is relatively wide, making two-handed exercises easier to perform. I don’t love the plastic shell, which leaves the SelectTech 840 more prone to breaking if dropped. Also, the handle is smooth, which makes holding onto the bell harder, especially after you’ve worked up a sweat. All in all, this is a basic, easy-to-use kettlebell with a moderately challenging weight range. If you’re a beginner or casual kettlebell user, you’ll enjoy BowFlex’s adjustable kettlebell. Powerblock is best known for its rectangular adjustable dumbbells, which can hold up to 100 pounds, but the brand also produces a rugged and compact adjustable kettlebell with a decent weight range. The 18- to 35-pound kettlebell has dimensions of 5.75″ L x 4.25″ W x 10″ H, while the 35-to-62-pound kettlebell has a dimensions profile of 8″ L x 5.5″ W x 11.25″ H. That’s not drastically smaller than other kettlebells on our list—in fact, Titan’s adjustable kettlebell is half an inch shorter than Powerblock’s heavier kettlebell—but its size relative to the weight range is what earned this pick the superlative of most compact. We like a few things about this kettlebell. First, the handle is wider than most single-weight and adjustable kettlebells, which I like for two-handed movements like swings and upright rows. This kettlebell is also made from steel and feels sturdy and durable. You can drop this and not worry that it will break; there aren’t any plastic parts. Lastly, the untraditional shape may throw off some kettlebell enthusiasts, but I think the sloped sides make it so it sits more comfortably on my wrist. Anyone who snatched or cleaned a traditional kettlebell knows the pressure that can be put on the wrist. Unfortunately, you have to choose between a lighter or heavier kettlebell. Each model replaces just four kettlebells, less than any other pick on this list. With the purchase of either kettlebell, you’ll get the shell plus three weights you can select using a pin. (FYI: You need the pin to choose the weights, and Powerblock doesn’t seem to sell a replacement part.) Sixy-two pounds is a substantial top-end weight for an adjustable kettlebell, with only the Titan Loadable Kettlebell Swing and Bells of Steel Competition Kettlebell offering a heavier weight. We picked Titan as the best budget option because $120 for the equivalent of seven kettlebells is pretty damn good. It looks and (mostly) feels like a traditional kettlebell, is compact, and uses cast-iron plates, which adds to the product’s durability. What we like most about Titan’s kettlebell is its price and shape. Regarding gym equipment, $120 is pretty affordable for almost any product. A 40-pound kettlebell from Titan Fitness costs $70, so add six more kettlebells to your cart, and you’re definitely exceeding $120 bucks. The shape and size are comparable to traditional kettlebells, which means you shouldn’t have a hard time adjusting your technique if you switch over to this model. This kettlebell starts at 10 pounds and goes up to 40 pounds, a good weight range for beginners and intermediate lifters. The weight is light enough to master movements like the snatch, clean, and jerk and to burn out the muscles during exercises like curls and overhead presses. Unfortunately, 40 pounds isn’t enough weight for stronger individuals to get much out of movements like kettlebell swings, rows, chest presses, and deadlifts. If you’re looking to take on high-rep workouts with intensity, you can put this bell to use. However, expect to out-grow this weight range at some point. The weights on this kettlebell aren’t marked, so you need to read the plates on the inside to figure out how much you’re lifting. Ideally, Titan would paint the numbers somewhere on this kettlebell. Also, adjusting Titan’s kettlebell isn’t as easy as most other picks on this list. You need to unlock the plates and then slide them out one at a time. But these are little nuisances in the grander scheme of what you're getting for the price. Read More: The Best Weight Benches We’ll admit that this is more of a kettlebell-adjacent tool, but we're including it on this list because it’s affordable, you can load it up to 500 pounds, it uses weight plates, and you can use it in a few creative ways. First, let’s be clear: Titan’s loadable handle is not a kettlebell replacement. It’s nowhere close to the dimensions of a standard kettlebell, so you can’t perform classic kettlebell movements like the snatch, clean, and jerk. As the name implies, Titan’s Loadable Kettlebell Swing is for swinging, with the main benefit being that you can load it with hundreds of pounds. Swinging this handle will not feel like swinging a kettlebell. It’s 19 inches tall, eight inches taller than a competition kettlebell. You’ll probably feel unstable and unbalanced the first few times you swing this handle, as the plates are relatively far from your center of gravity. You’re also going to need to assume a wider stance than you’re used to when using standard kettlebells. A competition kettlebell is 8.25 inches wide. By comparison, some metal 45-pound plates are nearly 17 inches across, and 25-pound plates are almost 12 inches across. We suggest loading 5-, 10-, and 25-pound plates onto the handle so you don’t have to set your stance as wide. Even though you can’t technically replace a kettlebell with this handle, it’s still a valuable and fun addition to any home gym. Aside from heavy swings, you can perform one-arm rows, upright rows, single-arm farmer’s carries, duck walks, and elevated sumo deadlifts with this handle. We say “addition” to a home gym because this handle is an excellent buy if you own weight plates. Otherwise, you’ll need to shell out extra money for the plates to load this handle. If you’re looking for a pure kettlebell replacement, Titan’s Loadable Kettlebell Swing is not for you. However, with a $50 price tag and a 500-pound weight capacity, we think serious strength athletes will love this unique tool's ability to perform heavy swings, rows, elevated deadlifts, and carries.

    "combined_text": "This Father of Four Lost 100 Pounds on a GLP-1\n\n<p>After years of failed diets, Brian turned to telehealth and a GLP-1. Not only did he lose weight, he stopped snoring and rebuilt his life.</p>\n\nBrian W. had tried to lose weight for years with no success. After his health continued to suffer—his blood pressure and blood sugar levels were high and he’d developed sleep apnea—he turned to telehealth, where a doctor prescribed him a GLP-1. The medication affected his appetite—which then changed his life. NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS were never hard for me. Every year, I knew exactly what I wanted to do: lose weight. The hard part came next. Actually doing it. Don’t get me wrong—I’d tried all sorts of diets. (Once, I even tried intermittent fasting, which isn’t for the faint of heart.) I’d stay strong for a while, but I’d eventually fall back into my normal habits of overeating. I knew the weight was taking a toll on my health. At 261 pounds, I had high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. I had also developed sleep apnea, a disorder where I temporarily stopped breathing at night. My snoring was so bad that my wife would go sleep in a different bedroom. I was miserable, but felt like there was nothing I could do about it. I had tried for so long to lose weight, only to backslide a few months later. I’d lost all confidence in myself. I no longer believed it was possible. I HIT ROCK bottom in December of 2023. I had just gotten back from a vacation in Jamaica with my wife. It would have been a great trip if I hadn’t taken any pictures of myself. I was shocked at how big I had become. I thought, “Oh my God, I’m huge.” I knew I could have a heart attack or stroke at any minute. I owed it to my wife and four children to be around for as long as I possibly could. A few months later, I saw a commercial for LifeMD , a telehealth company that connects people with board-certified doctors for health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and insomnia. After I did some lab work, I started meeting online with a doctor, who prescribed a GLP-1 medication called Mounjaro, off label, for weight loss. Was I a little skeptical at first? Of course. You have to be. But I’d tried everything else to lose weight—so why not this? Right away, though, I noticed two big things: I started taking Mounjaro in February 2024, and right away, I noticed a change in my appetite. The medication works by inhibiting a hormone that affects appetite and slows down the rate of digestion, so you feel fuller, longer. I went from overeating all the time, to leaving half of my meal on the plate because I was so full. That was one of the biggest changes to my diet — my portion sizes were so much smaller. I didn’t want to just fill up with junk food, though, so I swapped some unhealthier stuff for, say, a protein shake at breakfast. That also sat better in my stomach—especially because I couldn’t eat as much food without feeling bloated. In the past, I barely worked out at all. I just didn’t have the energy. Once I started taking the medication, though, it was much easier to be active. It was a relief not to be out of breath all the time. I started off slow, with daily walks, and then started running, too. Then I started biking again. Now, I do all three—and love it. SO FAR, I’VE lost 100 pounds—and I’m happy to say that you can tell. I used to wear a size 2X in shirts and a size 42 or 44-inch waist. Now, I wear a size medium and have a 29-inch waist. Needless to say, shopping is fun again. I like the way I look these days—but even more so, I like the way I feel. I have so much more energy now, and my confidence is through the roof. Part of that is because I sleep better. (And so does my wife, since I don’t snore anymore.) But it’s also because I feel optimistic. When I look at my kids now, I don’t worry so much about having a heart attack. I feel hopeful that I’ll be around long enough to see them grow old someday.

    "combined_text": "The Copenhagen Plank Will Upgrade Your Ab Workout\n\n<p>This plank variation challenges even the strongest core–and gives runners an extra form boost, too. </p>\n\nHow often have you dismissed the plank? Sure, it's a simple movement that doesn't stir much excitement when you see someone holding the position in a corner of the gym—but if you level up to one of the toughest variations of the exercise around, the Copenhagen plank, you won't be so quick to snub your nose. Underrated and underused (and maybe initially overwhelming on first attempt),  the Copenhagen plank without question is one of the most challenging plank variations out there. One major advantage of the Copenhagen plank is that there’s little chance that you'll get bored. Forget counting your reps in minutes. If you do it right, you should be giving everything you have for seconds. But once you master it, according to Men’s Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., and fitness editor Brett Williams, N.A.S.M., the Copenhagen plank will provide plenty of core-crushing benefits, especially if you're a runner. Normally when we think side plank, we prioritize bracing our entire core. The Copenhagen is a little bit different, according to Samuel. “Because we're going to work a lot of lateral stability in this plank, you're going to start to get a lot of hip effect,” Samuel says. “Your adductors and abductors and both your inner and outer thighs are going to wind the firing in this move as well.” You’ll also notice that you’re actually set up in a position that mirrors a runner's stride, so be aware of reinforcing a good, high-knee position, and make sure you can own it in the sagittal plane. Get Set Up on the Bench To start, you’ll need a bench, or ideally a raised platform that doesn’t have a back on it, like an ottoman. This will allow you to scale your plank’s difficulty level. And trust us, you’ll first need to make adjustments. Place your top shin on the bench. You’ll notice the closer you get your knee to the bench, the easier it becomes as you’re working with less lever. Move it out more, and the lever becomes longer and more challenging. We suggest starting about two inches out. Hold a Strong Side Plank From here, think of a side plank.In other  words, place your forearm perpendicular to your torso on the ground—that's going to protect your shoulder, then shift into a safer external rotation. Think about squeezing both shoulder blades and glutes. You’re almost there, but Samuel says there’s one final piece to the Copenhagen puzzle. As this move is already creating a ton of tension through your glutes and shoulder blades, keeping your free leg raised and in the proper 90 degree position is serious anti-rotation work for your core. For runners, this position reinforces the posture you want when you run. Again, you’ll hold a Copenhagen plank nowhere near the same amount of time you would a standard plank. And since it is so challenging, it’s best to make this your first move of your core workout. Remember the Copenhagen keys: maintain stability and squeeze your glutes and shoulder blades while fighting off rotation in both directions. If you can nail those, you’ve just dominated the once-indomitable exercise. “That's what makes this a great plank,” Samuel says.  “This is a super challenging move, but that’s the idea.” Want to master even more moves?

    "combined_text": "The 6 Best Cooling Towels, Tested by Fitness Editors and Trainers\n\n<p>When the heat is slowing you down, these towels are here for you.<br></p>\n\nOur product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? WHEN YOU'RE WORKING hard in the gym or in the yard, heat can make an already challenging experience even more brutal. And any regular gym goer knows that with enough people crammed into a small area, the temperature can rise quickly while you're in the middle of your workout. No matter what the date on the calendar says, when you're feeling the heat during outdoor work or workouts , finding a way to cool down is essential. That's where cooling towels come to the rescue, offering a quick and convenient method to lower body temperature and beat the heat (and less obstructive than a neck fan ). Made from high-tech fabrics including antimicrobial microfiber and PVA with evaporative technology that activate with water, these towels have become a must-have accessory for beachgoers , backyard enthusiasts, and fitness hounds alike. While they don't provide hydration or full-body sun protection , and don't have the same absorbtion of standard gym towels , cooling towels serve as a valuable tool in hot and humid weather conditions , especially when putting in work for your summer body . To guide you towards the best cooling towels on the market, we conducted our own extensive research and consulted MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S . Our selection process is meticulous and comprehensive, focusing on key features including material quality, activation mechanism, cooling performance, technological features, and affordability. Each cooling towel on our list has been subjected to rigorous evaluation to determine its effectiveness across a range of scenarios. Different cooling towels utilize various technologies to provide cooling relief. Some towels rely on evaporative cooling only, while others may incorporate cooling gels or advanced fabric technologies. For safety purposes, consumers with pets or small children should steer clear of towels made with cooling gels or alcohol-based fabrics. The material of a cooling towel plays a crucial role in its effectiveness and comfort. Look for towels made of fabrics like microfiber or PVA (Polyvinyl acetate) that are soft against the skin and provide optimal moisture absorption. Consider the size of the cooling towel and whether it offers sufficient coverage for your desired application. Larger towels may be more versatile, allowing you to drape them around your neck, wrap them around your head, or use them on larger areas of the body (which is especially great for sun protection). Some towels, like those from FROGG TOGGS, may even be cut to size based on your specific preferences. A high-quality towel should be reusable and withstand multiple uses and washes without losing its cooling properties or falling apart. Look for towels that are easy to activate and require minimal maintenance. Consider whether the towel can be easily reactivated by simple steps like wetting, wringing, or snapping. Similarly, you'll likely want a machine washable towel to ensure cleaning is low-maintenance. Some cooling towels may offer extra features such as UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) sun protection, antimicrobial properties, carrying cases, or the ability to cut or customize the towel's size to fit your needs. Being the Fitness and Commerce Editor of Men's Health means I get my hands on every piece of new gym gear that releases, sometimes before it releases. To build this guide to the best cooling towels, I took the existing best-selling towels on the market and put them up against any previously overlooked classics and newly released options. I used these to cool my summer workouts, using each towel across multiple modalities to examine how effective they were. Other editors on the team were consulted, including our fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., and we put countless cooling towels through the paces and evaluated their effectiveness, durability, comfort, and cooling technology. We also considered price point, as some cooling towels provide a better overall value than others. Our team tested these towels in the gym, on the track, and during group classes. So, whether you're a dedicated runner, outdoor CrossFit fitness enthusiast, or someone who simply enjoys spending time in the sun, read on to discover the best cooling towels to keep you comfortable when things heat up.

One downside: It's pretty spacious and requires some securing to stay in place while moving about. Luckily, there's a snap closure to help with that Cooling towels work by leveraging a process known as evaporative cooling to produce a their chilly sensation. The mechanism involves the interaction between the towel, water, and air. Here's how it works: For the cooling towels included in our list, cleaning and maintaining is no different than how you'd care for a traditional sweat towel. If the towel becomes soiled, simply pop it into a washing machine with standard clothing detergent and rinse thoroughly. If you don't have access to a washing machine, hand washing works well, too. In case of mildew or odor development, soak the towel in a mixture of 1 tablespoon baking soda to 1 gallon of warm water for an hour or two before washing. When it comes to drying, we recommend checking the specific towel's instructions. While some can be machine dried, some indicate hanging to dry. For storage, place it in its original storage tube, a plastic bag, or hang.

    "combined_text": "How Marlon Wayans Trained to Get Football Fit at 53\n\n<p>To play a quarterback in the new horror film <em>Him</em>, the comedian hit the gym to pack on muscle.</p>\n\nMARLON WAYANS SPORTS a grimace as he gingerly walks into the Elite Performance Clinic , a gym in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of northern Los Angeles. A rib is jabbing his upper back, making it tough to breathe. He has an appointment with his chiropractor later, but this morning, he’s still going to train. He starts with 10 minutes in a redox room, a room-temperature chamber that fills with a mineral-infused mist that helps relieve oxidative stress. Then it’s into a spinal decompression chair for 10 minutes. Then 15 minutes of meditation. It’s the calm before a sweat storm. “Sometimes you’re going to need to sit,” says Wayans, tilting his head as a smirky smile crosses his face. “You know you can go harder after you sit.” This holistic work is new for Wayans, who at 53 might just be in the best mind-and-body shape of his life. Previously, he’d go to the gym, pick a body part, and grind. “I’m just moving,” he says. “That in itself is a win, but when you talk with somebody who knows what the fuck they’re doing, it’s different.” That somebody is his trainer, Adam Quinter , who he’s worked with for 18 months. One of Quinter’s first recommendations was to urge his client to build a meditation room in his house. He also prescribed 30-minute walks as well as the kind of workout Wayans is going to do now: a total-body circuit, six to eight exercises, three or four sets, with 30 to 60 seconds’ rest between rounds. Wayans says Quinter is helping him find balance. Not the kind of balance that makes him pump the brakes, but the kind that allows him to keep his foot on the gas without crashing, whether in the gym or onstage. “I just go,” he says. With apologies to James Brown, Wayans might be the new Hardest Working Man in Showbiz. He leaves Los Angeles most Thursdays and returns Mondays. He’s in the middle of a national stand-up comedy tour that started in February and runs through December. He’s simultaneously shooting the last season of Peacock’s Bel-Air and promoting the Jordan Peele–produced Him , in which he plays an aging GOAT quarterback. He’s also reuniting with his brothers Keenen and Shawn on a reboot of Scary Movie , the iconic horror movie spoof franchise they started in 2000. And he’s also a dad of three. “The frequency I move at on a daily basis is not human,” he says. “Sometimes I’ll go six months without a day off. I’ve always been a hard worker, but I have to learn to be a smart worker.” His smart work begins with a yoga flow that includes a toe-stretch pose, a child’s pose, a modified scorpion, and a pigeon pose. Then Wayans gets into a plank position and Quinter puts a 15-pound chain on his back. Wayans holds the plank for 60 seconds. After three rounds, he is ready to move some heavier weight. He starts this circuit pressing out pushups with the chain draped over his back. He moves to step-ups on a 20-inch box while holding 30-pound dumbbells. Then it’s back to the chain, this time draped around his neck as he muscles out pullups, screaming curses. The chain adds load and instability to Wayans’s pullups and pushups. He bangs out Romanian deadlifts and then 25-yard sled pushes that target his legs and core. Wayans hurls out a curse but leans into the grind, relishing the pain of the process. Wayans finds motivation in pain, but he says he’s learning to intertwine the physical acts of fitness more with the “spiritual act of what I’m trying to do in my career.” Working out offers a release, just like his work: After his parents’ deaths, he coped by creating a comedy special. He’s working on another special now about his oldest child, Kai, who transitioned “from being a girl to a boy,” Wayans says. “It’s about my transition—dealing with them transitioning—as a father and how I went from denial to acceptance. It’s beautiful, but the journey was painful. When you come from that place, you’re not just doing jokes. You’re healing people—in a funny way.” Wayans sips water and readies himself for the final five exercises—no time to slow down. And tomorrow? He’ll do it all again, funky rib, heavy chain, loud cursing and all. WAYANS SPENDS MORE nights in hotel rooms than in his own bed. That's why his trainer, Adam Quinter, crafted a full-body workout fitted for the basic hotel gym. Holding a dumbbell at your chest, bend your knees and drop until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Push through the heels to return to the start. 4 sets, 12 to 15 reps each set Start with your hands below your shoulders, balls of your feet on the floor. Descend until your elbows reach 90 degrees. Push back up. 4 sets, 20 reps Start in a dead hang, grasping a bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Squeeze the bar and raise your chin to it.

    "combined_text": "Everything You Need to Know About Compound Exercises\n\n<p>Your workouts will be most effective using these essential strength training movements. Here's how. </p>\n\nMOST GUYS GO about their business in the gym with one of two goals: They either want to build strength or gain muscle (or just as likely, they hope to achieve a bit of both). To achieve either of those outcomes, they can't just show up and perform random exercises assuming they'll succeed. They'll need a plan—and the best of these are built around compound exercises. Compound exercises (also known as multi-joint movements) are the big-name exercises that often serve as a short-hand for strength. Bench presses , squats , deadlifts , rows —they're all compound exercises. All of these movements require multiple muscle groups working together to complete a rep—and because of this, you'll be able to load them up with lots of weight, a major factor in building strength (and, to a lesser degree, muscle too). \"Most of the time, when done correctly, compound movements could involve the entire body,\" says Don Saladino, NASM , celebrity trainer and Men's Health Advisory Board member. \"When you look at an exercise like a squat, even though traditionally people are using this as a lower body movement, there's so many other body parts that are being involved.\" Compound exercises also provide an opportunity to build strength and size while improving how the body functions. Most of these movements echo the way that you operate in real life—think about how often you squat to sit down or hinge at the hips to pick something up off the floor. Your body rarely moves at just one joint, so it makes sense to train that way, too. Before building up a workout program, you'll benefit from learning a bit more about compound exercises and how to use them. A compound exercise is a movement that requires the activation several muscle groups through the movement of at least two joints. Take the squat , for instance. There's movement at the hips, knees, and ankles, requiring muscle activation from your glutes, hamstrings, quads, core, and more. Depending on how you load the movement, even more muscle groups can get involved. For an example of the simpler isolation exercises , Saladino offers up biceps curl . He notes that only the elbow is flexing and extending, allowing the isolation of the biceps muscle. These types of movements won't be able to be loaded as heavily, and are less efficient than compound exercises. Since compound movements harness more than one muscle group working in tandem to complete the exercise, you'll be able to load them with more weight than when you isolate one muscle. This is a reliable way to build strength as you add more load to challenge your muscles to adapt and grow in response to increased stimulus—it's the principle known as progressive overload . You'll be able to challenge your muscles more with these big movements. Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at once, so you're able to train your whole body with fewer exercises than a routine with only isolation movements. While you may think about a deadlift as a lower body movement, as your hamstrings and glutes work to drive hip extension, your back muscles are also crucial to help to keep the load in place as you pull from the floor. During the bench press, your triceps and pectoral muscles work together, as your triceps extend your elbows and your pecs adduct to push the weight up above you. With all of these muscle groups working together, you'll also burn more calories. Overall, these exercises are \"going to give you better bang for your buck,\" says Eric Sung, C.S.C.S . Since you'll use multiple joints at once with compound movements, stability is a key to success. Small stabilization muscles will fire up to support the motion through our joints while our bigger muscles power the movement itself. Compound exercises will almost always, \"force a lot of stability,\" Saladino says. \"It's going to require more neuromuscular coordination.\" If you've ever felt winded after a set of front squats, don't mistake the need to catch your breath for being out of shape. There will be significantly more energy output when you're working through a set of a compound exercise compared an isolation exercise, according to Saladino. They carry a more intense \"cardiovascular component,\" he notes. \"When you're doing an exercise like a squat, a lunge, a deadlift, it's incredibly taxing to the nervous system.\" The central nervous system will play a big role in compound exercises, too. As you perform these big moves, you'll experience this type of fatigue—meaning that it will be important to come to them fresh. Compound movements should have a place in your routine, no matter your training frequency. \"I don't care if I'm programming up a routine that's twice a week or five days a week—I'm including some form of a compound movement in every workout,\" Saladino says. Compound movements are incredibly versatile, which makes them easy to slot them into an everyday routine. They don't always have to be loaded, either. A bodyweight squat is still just as much of a compound movement as a barbell back squat. Because of that, you can vary the load, intensity, and muscular focus of your compound exercises every time you workout. \"There's so many different ways that you can set up compound movements, to where it can be incredibly user friendly,\" says Saladino. If you do decide to dial in on a heavy compound lift, like a squat or a deadlift, complete it before you do any isolation work so that you're working on your most energy taxing exercise while you still have the most energy. For beginners, Sung suggests three to five sets of five to 12 reps, depending on the level of load—if you're going for heavy weights, keep the reps low. Not all compound exercises are for everyone. Just because a barbell back squat is one of the most commonly programmed lifts, it might not be a fit for you depending on your body and your abilities, Saladino says. Whether you have preexisting issues due to injuries, an anatomy that isn't ideal for particular movements , or restrictions due to mobility, you might find that common exercises don't work for you . The good news is there are several different ways to get your compound lifts in, like switching up the placement of the load or the equipment . If you're new to strength training, it might take you a little while to be able to build up a base for what an exercise should feel like. New lifters might not \"have the muscular endurance, or the stabilization, to be able to maintain good position,\" throughout a lift, Saladino says. Be honest with yourself about your fitness level. Tailor the reps, sets, and load accordingly. You may be used to seeing fitness influencers and athletes max out barbell squats and deadlifts, but many don't need to be doing that. \"A lot of people end up going to failure in the beginning. And they don't have that tolerance and understanding that failure is really taxing,\" Saladino says. \"It's okay in the beginning to cut yourself short a rep or two [short] so you're maximizing every repetition, and build[ing] that foundation over time.\" Many make the mistake, though, of never challenging themselves on bigger compound exercises—and that's doesn't just mean they're not lifting heavy. There are several ways to make compound movements more challenging without stacking on the plates, Sung says—like adding pause reps or slowing down the eccentric portion of an exercise. These kinds of things will get you away from your same sets and reps of the same weight, helping muscle and strength grow. WHY: There's a reason squats are one of the most touted compound exercises. The movement is powered from the hips and knees which fires up the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and core—all while depending on the back muscles to be engaged to support the load. Plus, there are plenty of variations that will allow you to put more stress on specific muscles. How to Do It: Reps and sets: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps WHY: Deadlifts are a \"really functional movement that everyone should be able to do whether it relates to picking up groceries, etc, are all daily life activities the deadlift will help with,\" Sung says. The hip hinge is important, and you'll master it here. How to Do It: Reps and sets: 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps to start WHY: The pushup is a standard bodyweight exercise that works way more than the chest. The exercise is very scalable, making is a great pick for anyone to add to their routine, Sung says. There are plenty of varieties for different points of focus, too. How to Do It: Reps and sets: 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps WHY: Master the inverted row to build back strength. Maintaining the straight body position will also require glute and core engagement. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps WHY: With unilateral movements , the \"entire body is stabilizing—you really are utilizing tension techniques throughout the whole body,\" Saladino says. Lunges are a great exercise to begin unilateral training. They can be loaded up with a variety of equipment, and engage your quads, glutes, and core. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps per leg WHY: It's a staple upper body exercise for a reason, and the bedrock of many a chest day workout. The classic bench press does more than just work the chest, however. Powering the bar up depends on the triceps, and you'll need to lock in on the bench by engaging your mid-back and core. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps to start WHY: This heavyweight row variation recruits your big back muscles to pull, but also challenges your lower body to stay in proper position as you progress through the set. Bonus: if you flip to a supinated (underhand) grip, you'll crush your biceps even more, too. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps WHY: This small piece of equipment packs a big punch. If you have an ab wheel available to you, don't be afraid to try it out. This movement encompasses pretty much all of your abdominal muscles, as well as your shoulders, glutes, and lower back muscles.

    "combined_text": "How Many Biceps Exercises You Actually Need to Build Big Arm Muscle\n\n<p>Yes, you want to build up your physique—but are you doing too much? Here's what you need to know.  </p>\n\nOur product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? FOR MOST GUYS , biceps training is pretty straightforward. Including even a single isolation exercise into a balanced strength routine once or twice a week will help you build the strength and flex appeal you're hoping to achieve. The reason: Your bis are engaged in just about every upper body pulling exercise ( chinup , pulldown , bent-over row , etc.) you do, so for most strength training goals, you don’t need to hit them with as many targeted moves as you might for a larger muscle group like your pecs or quads. But if you want to maximize your flex appeal so your arms are the focal point of your physique—even in the winter through a thick puffer jacket—you'll need more focused work. That takes a more dedicated approach like you’ll find in our Ultimate Arms Recomp training plan. That also raises an important question: What’s the ideal number of biceps-focused exercises you should include in your routines for optimum growth? We've got answers. If you’re prioritizing upper arm hypertrophy , you likely have at least one day per week when you really hammer your arms . That training session should contain three dedicated biceps moves that meet the following guidelines: An exercise that you can load maximally, such as a standing dumbbell , barbell, or EZ bar curl. The goal here is to push the limits of your strength so that you struggle to bang out your final few reps with good form. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps An exercise that changes your upper arm angle relative to your torso (e.g., a preacher curl , incline curl , or Bayesian/cable curl). That will challenge your biceps with a different “ strength curve ,” moving the most challenging point of curl from the middle to the beginning or end of the movement. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps An exercise that changes your wrist angle to emphasize your brachialis , the muscle directly beneath your biceps that’s just as important for upper arm girth and even more important for elbow flexion. The hammer curl, reverse curl , and Zottman curl are all excellent options. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps Performing an exercise from each of those categories will help ensure maximum muscle fiber recruitment and engagement. This approach will also inject your arm training with enough variety to avoid strength plateaus—as long as you continue to reach for heavier weights as you get stronger and switch up the exercises you perform about every two months. The short answer is: probably not. The long answer requires some context. If we expand our muscular view beyond the biceps, research shows that three targeted exercises (or about 10 total sets) is the minimum weekly recommendation for maximum growth, with the sweet spot likely closer to six exercises (or 20 total sets). So why limit yourself when it comes to your biceps? The answer is that those two-headed elbow flexors are among your body’s top workhorses, assisting other muscles as “secondary” movers in countless other exercises. Not only do your biceps kick into gear during isolation moves such as those mentioned above, but they also spring into action during just about every upper body pulling exercise you can imagine. That means every time you perform a pullup, pulldown, or row variation, you enlist your bis to help get the job done. They’re even engaged during exercises such as the deadlift and farmer’s walk to maintain grip strength and elbow joint tension and stability. That’s why performing more than three to six targeted biceps exercises a week will be overkill—even for those prioritizing arm growth. And if such growth is a priority, it’s also important not to neglect your triceps. After all, they comprise about two-thirds of your upper arms’ mass. Fortunately, the same rules apply when selecting triceps exercises. Check out our picks for the best 15 triceps exercises to round out your arm training.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? I HATE SHOPPING in person . There is no weekend activity that I dread more than having to go from store to store collecting bags, even when it’s the essentials. I’d much rather be hitting reps at the gym , running miles on the trail , doing laps in the pool , rolling on the BJJ mat, or anywhere else for that matter. For the most part, I know what I want before I buy it, either from previous experiences or by getting advice from someone whose opinion I respect. SHOP LABOR DAY FITNESS SALES ON AMAZON That is one of the reasons that I have come to rely on doing a lot of online shopping. It allows me the opportunity to pull the trigger on gear that I’ve been looking forward to trying out or needed to upgrade from previous models. That's why I always look forward to big sales events, like the ones that happen around holidays like Labor Day . I figured I'd share a few of my favorite picks from the sales available for those who hope to avoid spending more time in overcrowded malls or over-air-conditioned shopping centers. Here’s a list of gear that I’ve tested, was impressed by, and would recommend to anyone looking to level up their fitness game or preparing for marathon season. These aren't generic or unknown brands we are talking about here. These are serious offerings from tested and trusted brands like CAP Barbell , Flybird , Oura Ring , Shokz , and more. Being an editor at Men’s Health , it’s my job to know about the latest and greatest offerings, so I’ll be updating this list throughout the remainder of Labor Day. SHOP LABOR DAY FITNESS SALES ON AMAZON This weighted vest has really helped me elevate my bodyweight workouts . I've had this piece for years, and it gets used no matter the season. This vest is much more comfortable than other options than I've tried in the past. During the winter, bundled up and wearing my Wolf Tactical, I can make a lot out of a little amount of time. The open-sided design helps me stay cool during the summer months, too. Just remember you will need to purchase plates (here are the best from Wolf Tactical ) for any carrier you get, which means the savings you get here will come in handy. Sometimes simpler is better, and it doesn't get much better than this compact set of hex dumbbells from CAP Barbell. These dumbbells have all the features that I look for: knurled handles for grip, rubber ends so that you can place them on the ground without damaging your floor, and a hex design so they don't roll away when you do. Being a Fitness and Commerce Editor at Men's Health , it should come as no surprise that I've had a lot of pairs of dumbbells over the years. I especially like these, and bonus points for the convenient little rack they come with to keep them organized. There's nothing I like better than working out outdoors, getting some endorphins and a little natural vitamin D. That includes running and bicycling on the road for hours, even if it's a bit crisp outside. No matter whether you live in the city or in the suburbs, it's dangerous to be on the street with noise canceling headphones stunting your awareness. I like these Shokz OpenRun Pro 2s because I can keep listening to my training playlist while hitting the pavement. Like a lot of people, I spent a lot of my day looking at emails and data, which leaves my body idle while my brain works. Being someone who likes to stay active, no matter the circumstances, I like having training tools around my desk like this grip strengthener. This one from FitBeast is all you need, with multiple tools that can you can use to change up the habit. Grip strength is a big part of improving your upper body power. This is a great bench to pair with the CAP dumbbells, or whatever weights you have at home. It's a solid piece of gear to really increase the amount of exercises you can do. There are a lot of weight benches that out there, but many of them are pretty flimsy. Not the case with this Flybird bench, which is also pretty comfortable for those long training sessions when you're hitting chest. There are a lot of reasons I like this beautiful rower from Ergatta, which was a Men's Health Fitness Award winner pretty recently. The first thing I like about this piece of equipment is how good it looks: in the garage, in the basement, or even in the living room. Even though it appears to be a vintage piece, the cherry wood is actually quite durable. The water resistance provides one of the smoothest and most authentic rowing experiences available. The fact that you can save around $600 dollars on a model right now doesn't hurt either. There is also a great gamified digital experience available should you want it, making this a rowing machine you can look forward to using in the winter months. I have been running on NordicTrack's new T Series treadmills since they replaced the old EXP models. Sure, the brand has more premium models available, like the Commercial Series, but unless you have a good chunk of real estate for it and a few thousand dollars to burn, you may be looking for other options. These T Series treadmills are a solid option. I particularly like the T10, which has a good-sized running belt for most runners, as does the T5 version. The screen is small, but big enough for me to enjoy some sports or a series I've been watching. EZ bars are a great way to mix up your arm workouts. I have this one at home, which I picked up off of Amazon years ago and it still gets the job done. Sure, there are more expensive bars out there that are a little more refined, but for me this one all I need. The benefits to having an EZ bar? Getting to change up the grips on your curls, getting a more full workout of the bicep. I wrote about the benefits to your wrists in this story that I did about Hugh Jackman's training routine for Deadpool 3 . Yes, that's right, Wolverine uses an EZ bar too. I've never liked too much on my wrists, so in the past I haven't had much success sticking with a fitness tracker. I would wear a heart rate strap on more intense cardio sessions but that's about it. That changed when Oura Ring hit the scene, which I wrote about here . I like keeping track of my biomarkers, and being able to switch fingers keeps me from feeling too constrained. The data I collect from their app helps inform the training decisions I make throughout the week. The new Oura Ring 4 is great, but the software is just as good with this Oura Gen3, and you also get to snag the Heritage style. This particularly cool design was my favorite, but was moved away from with this latest release. These days, I've transitioned from longer runs and marathon training into a more regular and shorter running practice. Because of this I've moved away from the overly-cushioned super shoes, and into these still-super-comfortable daily trainers. These shoes were made to run in every day, and I do. The Ghost 16s have popped in our \" best shoes \" guides quite a few times, as I'm not the only editor who is a fan. This colorway is great too, bringing a little pop into the equation. If you have room for it, having a rack in your home gym is a huge upgrade. It helps you perform those fundamental lifts like squats and presses. This one from Sportsroyals is solid and is impressively multi-functional. Not only does this rack support your fundamental lifts, but it also allows you do add cable training and bodyweight exercises like dips or pull-ups your routine. I was on a cycling cardio kick until recently, when we were lucky enough to welcome our daughter Rose into the family. She recently turned a year old, and was cleared by our doctor to join me on a run in a jogging stroller. Now there is nothing I look forward to more than buckling her up in the Thule and going for a jog on the track or on some local trails. The Urban Glide lives up to its name, keeping the ride smooth no matter what terrain we are on. Be sure to select the \"single\" option when you are purchasing the stroller. I drink a lot, a lot, of water throughout the day. But when you are having the summer that we are having right now, and you like to train outdoors, it's never enough. I have enjoyed adding a Liquid I.V. to my water almost daily, usually after I've finished my run. Their citrus-based flavors are refreshing and fun. It's an easy way to level up a glass of water and keep the hydration process from getting too monotonous.

During that time, I learned great sources of protein that were plant-based, but the products from Orgain is what helped me hit my quotas. I believe this to be one of the cleanest, and the best tasting, protein powders on the market. If you're like me, you don't mind filling a closet full of protein, because it'll always be needed.

    "combined_text": "How to Use Reps in Reserve (RIR) to Build More Muscle\n\n<p>Using this approach will yield more gains than chasing a pump. </p>\n\nOLD-SCHOOL BODYBUILDERS will tell you that the most surefire way to build muscle and feel the effects of your effort is the pump . The swollen sensation that comes when your target muscles are engorged with blood is the highlight of training for many meatheads, so much so that \"chasing the pump\" is a go-to descriptor for a particular approach to workouts, filled with marathon sets to capture the feeling. Yes, you can build muscle when you chase the pump—but you're leaving gains on the table when you exhaust yourself in its pursuit. There are limitations to what you can accomplish when you're training with that objective, since you'll likely be using isolation exercises to target specific muscles rather than compound movements and lighter weights to be able to take on a high volume of reps. You won't be able to train as intensely as you need to for maximal muscle growth. There are more effective ways to build muscle and more efficient methods to go about it. Specifically, an approach often called reps in reserve (RIR). The approach is relatively simple, according to MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., who broke it down as a solution to the common mistake of chasing the pump in his Don't List video for building muscle. Using RIR in your workouts will allow you to train with the intensity needed to create stimulus for muscle growth, and the concept is exactly as the name implies: RIR refers to the amount of reps you could realistically perform (with good form) if you were to keep going after the prescribed reps were completed. Here's how to apply it: For all of the working sets of your session, challenge yourself to the point that you feel like you would only be able to complete two more reps. You're not training to failure here; that approach can be useful in specific scenarios, but you would burn out too quickly to achieve the type of muscle-building stimulus you're hoping to elicit if you fail each set. If your training plan was to perform 3 sets of 8 reps, for example, you would push to make the eighth rep hard enough that you would only be able to perform two more with good form. \"The final rep that you do is going to be slower than the earlier reps that you did, and is going to be hard and challenging,\" Samuel says. \"You might have a little bit of doubt whether you can actually complete the rep with good form.\" That struggle is what you're aiming to achieve. Samuel says that it's okay if your form wavers a bit near the end—but make sure that you don't push beyond your limits. If you find yourself finishing that final rep easily, on the other hand, that doesn't mean to push to 10 or 12 reps for every set. Instead, use that as a gauge of your effort. That's a sign to use heavier weights so that you can reach the level of intensity you're aiming to achieve. Want to know more about building real muscle?

    "combined_text": "How Many Exercises Should You Do Per Muscle Group?\n\n<p>How many moves per muscle group does your exercise plan really need? We've got answers.</p>\n\nPOP QUIZ: HOW many reps and sets should you do per exercise to build muscle? If you’re in the know, you're aware that the answer is generally three to four sets of eight to 12 reps (although recent research has shown muscle building can occur at lower rep ranges, too ). You likely also understand that load, rest period duration , and training frequency are also key variables when it comes to packing on lean mass. After all, hypertrophy (the technical term for muscle growth) is largely a numbers game, and getting the equation right can equal maximum gains in minimal time. You want to work hard, but your goal should be to work efficiently. Junk volume is a real problem you'll want to avoid—especially if you're working with limited time. With that in mind, there’s one aspect of weight room arithmetic that many guys get wrong (or at least overlook): How many exercises you should perform per muscle group to optimize your results. “More is better” is the most common approach, but research shows that there are lower and upper limits to this muscle math—and hitting the sweet spot between them is key to getting (and staying) on the hypertrophy fast track. The answer is different if your goal is strength or endurance (and more experienced lifters will be able to handle more volume), but if your primary focus is muscle growth, you should perform a minimum of three exercises per muscle group per week. Those exercises can be performed during a single workout (if you’re doing traditional split training, for example) or spread across two or three workouts (if you’re hitting your whole body each time), but the key is to perform at least three exercises per muscle group per week. (We’ll get into how to select those exercises in the next section.) This applies to the big muscle groups, like the legs and back. For smaller muscle groups like the biceps, triceps, and shoulders, where lots of exercises will be single-joint movements, you can aim for fewer sets. \"Perhaps one to two exercises,\" advises Men's Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., \"since the functions of those muscles are simpler.\" Also, keep in mind that the more complicated compound exercises will also involve those muscle groups, so you're training them that way, too. What’s the maximum number? That’s a good question—and one that science has yet to answer. Stacking on extra sets for each muscle group might also not be a realistic approach for regular guys with busy schedules. Who has time for that kind of targeted exercise volume except elite bodybuilders? In the real world, the consensus is that if you do between 10 and 20 sets (roughly three to six exercises) per muscle group per week, you’ll achieve the muscle-building sweet spot. Let’s start with the lower end of the spectrum, three exercises per week—a number that can be performed in a single workout or distributed across two or three training sessions, depending on your goals and schedule. Priority number one is to select an exercise that moves the targeted muscle group through maximum contraction and extension, and the associated joints through a full range of motion. If we’re talking quads, the barbell back squat is the perfect example. Next, you want to choose an exercise that varies one of the following three variables: plane of motion , angle of attack (in other words, varying the position of the exercise from the first exercise), or portion of the strength curve (where in the movement you'll be forced to exert the most force to complete the rep). Still focusing on the quads, that might mean a side squat, a leg press, or a front-loaded squat, respectively. Finally, choose a challenging bodyweight exercise . Make no mistake, unweighted moves aren’t just for beginners. In almost every instance, there’s a bodyweight exercise that can be just as challenging (or even more so) than its fully loaded counterpart. In the case of the squat, that exercise could be the pistol squat , which is performed on one leg at a time. (If you can’t perform an unassisted pistol squat, hold onto a stable pole or other supportive structure to make it easier.) Keep building your arsenal for each muscle group from there if you plan on hitting them more than once per week. The key is variation (within a structured program, of course). By consistently challenging each muscle group in multiple ways, you’ll ensure enough exercise variety in your training plan to not only maximize growth, but also to avoid plateaus.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? ANY PERFORMANCE GEAR worth its salt is going to claim to be “moisture-wicking.” No surprise, the term shows up in all of the workout clothing brands we recommend, from Vuori to Under Armour . But while most people have a vague idea that moisture-wicking has something to do with keeping you dry in sweaty situations, the details on what puts fabric into this category are poorly defined—to the general public, at least. Moisture-wicking is more than a marketing buzzword, though. While using moisture-wicking fabric at the gym isn’t going to magically morph you into Patrick Mahomes or Lebron James, wearing gym shorts or workout shirts that fall into this category can make you more comfortable during your workouts, according to Bert Mandelbaum, MD , sports medicine specialist and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles. Moisture-wicking fabric can be a crucial element to keeping you cool and dry, allowing you to push yourself a little harder without overheating, he says. Given how much this term is thrown around, it’s easy to mentally assign a definition to moisture-wicking based on your own experience. But some gear claims to be moisture-wicking when it’s actually not, making it important to be aware of what to look for. Because you probably don’t have a degree in textile sciences if you’re reading this (we don't either), we tapped two fabric experts and Mandelbaum for help breaking down what moisture-wicking actually means, plus what to look for when sussing out gear. You probably have some idea of what moisture-wicking means, but it never hurts to get into details. “Moisture-wicking fabrics are designed to pull sweat away from your skin and spread it across the outer surface of the fabric, where it can evaporate quickly,” explains Kerry Ryan , fashion designer and adjunct associate professor of fashion design at Pratt Institute. “Instead of soaking in like a sponge, the fibers act like tiny water slides, moving moisture along and helping you stay dry.” Once that moisture is shuttled away from your skin, it keeps on moving, says Imran Islan, PhD , associate professor of textile development and marketing at Fashion Institute of Technology. “As moisture moves to the fabric’s surface, an athlete or runner faces the air, which takes away the moisture,” he says. While plenty of companies will slap this label on a range of clothes, not all fabric is truly moisture-wicking. “To enhance wicking, a fiber should have a narrow and hollow structure,” Islan says. “This narrow space differentiates surface tension, allowing moisture to be transported from one location to another.” The narrower the fiber, the better the moisture-wicking properties, according to Islan. Synthetic fibers are more likely to be moisture-wicking, but there are certain natural fibers like Merino wool that are excellent at shuttling away moisture, Islan says. Activewear and performance gear that’s actually moisture-wicking is usually made up of one or several of these fabrics: Some fibers are champs at absorbing moisture, but that’s the opposite of moisture-wicking, Ryan points out. These are fabrics you want to avoid if wicking is your goal: Your body naturally produces excess heat when you’re working out, and you have to figure out how to dissipate that heat. By wicking moisture away from your skin, you can cool down faster, Mandelbaum explains. “You can’t eliminate heat when you exercise, because you’re constantly producing it—but your body is still trying to cool off,” Mandelbaum says. “Everything you can do to allow yourself to deal with incremental heat quickly will allow you to perform better.” Moisture-wicking fabric also has the added benefit of keeping your clothes from clinging to you when you sweat, Islan says. If you sweat in something like cotton, your clothes can end up feeling heavy and less breathable, trapping heat against your skin and making it harder to regulate your body temperature, Islan explains. “In contrast, moisture-wicking can enhance performance and overall comfort for athletes or individuals in warm conditions,” he says. Moisture-wicking fabric can even reduce chafing the growth of odor-causing bacteria, helping you to feel and smell better, Ryan says. Unfortunately, your performance gear can become less effective over time. “Synthetic fabrics may lose performance due to wear, fabric softener build-up, or residue from body oils, Ryan says. “Over time, the fiber structure that moves moisture can break down.” While natural fibers like Merino wool don’t break down the same way, Ryan says they can still get clogged by residue, limiting their moisture-wicking properties. Her advice: Wash your moisture-wicking gear with a sports-specific detergent and skip fabric softener to help them perform at their best. But if you find that your go-to moisture-wicking gear doesn’t seem to be keeping you dry anymore, it’s time to swap it out for something new.

So, when a small gap in his gargantuan schedule finally surfaced, [&#8230;]\n\nSinger and songwriter Kane Brown is a man that is constantly in demand. Balancing his time between touring and promoting his music, the country music star began to feel that his fitness levels were suffering as a result of always being on the go. So, when a small gap in his gargantuan schedule finally surfaced, Brown utilized some rare downtime to start getting shredded over the summer, ahead of the next leg of his “The High Road Tour.” To discuss his journey so far, Brown sat down with M&F and acknowledged his biggest challenge to come — staying consistent on his upcoming international tour. For more than a decade, Kane Brown has been a significant part of the soundtrack to our lives. His single, ‘Heaven’ sold more than 10 million units in the U.S. and ‘What Ifs’ has been streamed more than half-a-billion times on Spotify alone. But while Brown was riding high in the charts, a nagging feeling was telling him to get back into better shape. Then, in April, the singer found himself in Canada, scrolling though his phone, when he came across a clip of UFC President Dana White discussing the benefits of fasting .With three days off from his day job ahead of him, Brown decided to try it for himself. “And, I got six other people on tour with me to do it,” the singer tells M&F. “Once I saw what happened, I really didn’t want to put anything bad back into my body,” explains the star. “I started working out and training, and then I started looking into bodybuilding.”  Brown completed his fast by only drinking water, electrolytes, and bone broth, and was encouraged by the results (those on medication or with medical conditions should consult a health professional before starting prolonged fasts). Still, working on his physique during busier times would require adaptations. “The hardest part of staying fit with my lifestyle is the traveling,” explains Brown. However, the “Backseat Driver” singer’s confidence was boosted by that initial fast, because he proved to himself that he could spend time alone in hotel rooms without the desire to graze on junk foods to pass the time. He’s been in the driving seat with his health regime ever since. The star now takes pre-prepared meals on the road where possible, so that he doesn’t give in to temptation. “I would say, for me, it’s 80% kitchen, 20% gym, but I will say that it’s all mentality, too,” he explains. Formerly a self-professed Pop-Tart fiend, the singer’s refrigerator is now clear of processed foods and high sugar options. These days, whether he’s at home or performing far away, the star also says that he’s intent on getting his steps in. Brown loves to run or walk as his preferred forms of cardio. “Get a mile, minimum,” says the ‘Miles On It’ singer. “And then when you’ve got the mile, your day is set.” Brown has even become a positive force among his peers. “My manager likes to run, my videographer likes to run,” explains the singer, noting that he loves an incline for its heart pounding, fat burning effects. The star also says that dropping weight and working on his cardio has made him better at pastimes like basketball. “I feel young again,” says the 31-year-old. “I feel like I’m 21.” Brown shares that he generally aims for around 1,900 calories per day to stay in a small deficit, allowing himself one “refeed” day where he eats around 2,200 clean calories. “It’s been four months now, straight,” he shares of his journey to becoming buff.  A post shared by Kane Brown (@kanebrown)  Brown tells M&F that he works out seven days per week, split into two days for legs, two days for chest, one day for arms, and two for back and shoulders. He still runs at least a mile and works his core every day too. “I like to concentrate on the muscle that you are working,” explains the singer, noting that he likes to feel the contraction and full stretch with every rep. “Lighter weights, higher reps,” shares Brown when discussing how he’s become so ripped. “I have a lot of stamina.” As for making smart swaps, Brown substitutes old habits like snacking on Pop-Tarts with protein shakes instead. His “cheats” include scoops of almond butter — rich in fiber, vitamins, and healthy fats that can reduce bad cholesterol and support his cardiovascular health. With three young children including a one-year-old son, the popular Country music star explains that recovery from sleep is at a premium, but he likes to relax when he finds a moment by sitting in the sunshine and soaking up some rays. While Kane Brown has been crushing his workouts, avoiding nutritional pitfalls, and getting to grips with his new fitness regime, the star understands that his biggest challenge to consistency waits in the form of the European and UK legs of his highly success successful “The High Road Tour.” While taking in Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland, and England, the singer hopes to use what he’s learned and keep himself in shape despite the unpredictability of being on the road. Aside from regular workouts and taking in each city by running the streets, Brown is shunning the negative habits associated with stage performers and hopes to be in bed by midnight where possible. Of course, international tours are a great way to sample the cuisine of other cultures, so Brown is looking forward to visiting each stop, but plans to exercise portion control as a means of keeping his newly chiseled physique in check. “It’s about consistency,” acknowledges the global music phenomenon. “But then it’s about being flexible with that consistency.” To catch the Kane Brown, live, click here for ticket info.

Wait, what? Cardio and core? Before you click away, continue reading. The truth is, if you’re still training cardio and core separately, now’s the time to try combining both workouts—it can be a more efficient way to double your sweat return. Here’s where you can begin: This 15-minute bodyweight circuit blends high-intensity intervals with core-strengthening moves that not only burn calories but also build strength, coordination, and toughness. It targets your midsection through rotation, anti-rotation, and isometric tension while keeping your heart rate sky-high. All you need is your body, towels, open floor space, and 15 minutes to get after it. Whether you’re looking for a conditioning finisher or a standalone session, this one’s for you. When you combine core exercises with cardio-style intervals, you’re not just building abs; you’re also training your heart and lungs to be more efficient , rotate stronger, and resist fatigue where it matters most. This 30/30 format (30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest) balances effort and recovery while allowing you to push yourself hard. What makes this circuit effective is that each move challenges your core from different angles through rotation, anti-rotation, bracing, or balancing. You’re not just torching calories. You’re:  To maximize this workout, follow my tips below because when done well, it builds strength while burning calories. Here’s how to make every second count:  You’ll perform each exercise after a warm-up for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of rest, and repeat for three total rounds. 1A. Bodyweight Woodchopper (15 seconds per side) Targets: Obliques, shoulders, glutes, coordination Tip: Let the rotation come from your hips and torso, not your arms alone. 1B. Alternating Skater Hop to Stick Targets: Glutes, quads, adductors, core, balance Tip: Focus on landing quietly and your knee aligned with your foot. 1C. Alternating Rotational Mountain Climbers Targets: Rectus Abs, obliques, hip flexors, shoulders Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked over your wrists and your hips low. Twist with intent, not momentum. 1D. Hollow Hold Flutter Kicks Targets: Lower abs, hip flexors, core stability Tip: If your lower back arches, scale by raising the legs higher or bending the knees. 1E. Push-Up to Shoulder Tap Targets: Chest, triceps, shoulders, core stability Tip: Widen your feet to stay balanced and avoid excessive torso twisting. Avoid swaying or sagging, as you should keep your hips locked in. When you’re finished, your core’s cooked, your shirt’s soaked, and your body is buzzing with endorphins. You didn’t just get a sweat, you trained rotational power, dynamic stability, and cardiovascular endurance in just 15 minutes. Then walk away from this workout knowing you’ve accomplished something efficient and effective. This circuit isn’t your typical cardio. It’s core-focused, athlete-oriented, and built for real-world strength. Use it as a finisher, a standalone session, or a quick option when time is limited but you still want results. Having limited equipment is no reason to not make limitless physique-crushing gains. When your schedule is full, a dumbbell and a few minutes is all you need to get it done.

Some lifters treat it as a free pass to load up on burgers, fries, and milkshakes in the name of “getting big.” Sure, the scale moves up fast, but so does your body fat, leaving you sluggish in the gym and staring at an extended, painful cut when it’s time to lean down. The reality is, bulking doesn’t have to be an all-you-can-eat buffet. A well-run bulking cycle is calculated, structured, and purposeful. I’m talking about adding slabs of quality muscle while keeping fat gain under control, so that when you transition out, you’re bigger, stronger, and still relatively lean.  Think of it like tuning a race car. You can’t just dump in cheap fuel and expect world-class performance. With the right balance of nutrition, training, and recovery, you can build size that lasts, strength that translates, and a physique you’ll be proud of at the end of the cycle. I’ve seen this firsthand both in the weight room and on the performance field. As a coach with a Master’s in Sports Performance, NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS), National Sports Performance Association Certified Sports Nutrition Coach, and USAW National Coach, I’ve helped athletes and lifters of all levels bulk the right way. Whether it’s preparing an Olympic weightlifter for competition or guiding everyday athletes in the gym, the same principles hold: smart bulking builds muscle without the baggage. In the sections ahead, we’ll lay out the blueprint for bulking smarter: dialing in your calories without overdoing it, training for muscle instead of just numbers, and building the daily habits that separate the jacked from the bloated. Make this list your go-to menu to gain muscle without fat. Calories drive growth, but the quality and quantity of those calories determine if you’re building lean muscle or just adding belly fat. As a certified nutrition coach, I’ve seen lifters make the same mistake over and over again, thinking bulking means eating without limits. That might move the scale, but most of that weight comes from fat. A better approach is starting with a moderate surplus of 250–500 calories above maintenance. This keeps your body in growth mode without forcing you to diet for months on end afterward. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Find Your Surplus Sweet Spot: Track weekly weight gain. A reasonable rate is 0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week. Faster than that, and your body is likely storing fat instead of building muscle. Coach’s Note: Eating like it’s Thanksgiving every night isn’t bulking—it’s bingeing. Smart bulking involves consuming clean foods in slightly larger quantities and adjusting your intake as your body responds. Training during a bulk is about creating the right stimulus for hypertrophy while maintaining optimal recovery. The goal is to convert extra calories into high-quality muscle with consistent, structured training. As a strength coach, I program bulking cycles differently from strength or peaking cycles. The priority is progressive overload in the hypertrophy range. This means pushing for steady increases in weight, reps, or sets each week to build muscle mass rather than test maximum strength. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Coach’s Note: During a bulk, volume and quality are the focus. Push for consistent progress in your training and avoid sloppy lifting that can stall your results. Training and nutrition are the foundation of a bulk, but lifestyle choices decide how well your body responds. Recovery, sleep, hydration, and stress management are often the difference between gaining lean muscle and spinning your wheels. Here’s what I emphasize with athletes: Coach’s Note: Lifestyle is the glue that holds training and nutrition together. Dial in these habits, and your bulking cycle will run smoother with far better results. Not all bulks are created equal. A smart bulk builds lean mass with minimal fat gain, while a dirty bulk leaves you sluggish and forces you into a long, painful cut. Here’s the difference I highlight with lifters: Coach’s Note: A lean 10 pounds gained from a smart bulk will outperform a sloppy 20 every time. Muscle built with intention lasts, while fat only adds more work later. Bulking should never be an excuse to get sloppy. With the right balance of nutrition, structured training, and supportive lifestyle habits, you can add lean muscle that looks good and performs even better. The key is precision—eating enough to grow, training with intent, and recovering so your body can utilize the extra calories effectively. A smart bulk builds strength, confidence, and muscle mass that you’ll retain even after the cycle ends. A dirty bulk only sets you up for extra fat loss later. The difference comes down to discipline and consistency in the details. The bodybuilder is readying for the pro stage with his own brand of \"science.\" If the majority of your answers are “yes,” you’re bulking smart. If not, it’s time to tighten up your approach before small mistakes become significant setbacks. Coach’s Note: When you step into a bulking cycle, think precision, not permission. Fuel your training, recover properly, and build size you’ll be proud of when it’s time to show the results. Protein is everywhere in the grocery store, so it's time to learn what you're about to consume. Press blend on these recipes and get ready to boost your protein shake game.

With the 2025 New Delhi World Championships in his crosshairs, Mayhugh talks M&F though his training and ultimate goal of collecting more gold at the LA 2028 Summer Paralympics. “I had my first seizure when I was 14,” explains Mayhugh, reflecting on how this event would finally lead to his questions being answered. Prior to that day, he’d been an active and skilled soccer player, but had always suffered with a sense that the left side of his body wasn’t as strong as the right and didn’t react in the same way. As a growing boy, there were hopes that these feeling would rectify, but MRIs conducted after his seizure clarified his condition. At first, doctors thought that the black spot that showed up during an X-ray on this brain could be a tumor, but ultimately it was determined that Mayhugh was suffering with cerebral palsy, potentially brought on by a traumatic birth.  Having only just got started with D.C. United’s Youth Academy, doctors told Mayhugh that he should never play soccer, or any type of sports again. His family understandably felt a strong duty to protect him from the risk of physical exertion. “That next six months was the hardest of my entire life,” he shares with M&F. “It was very dark; it was very sad and depressing. I wasn’t able to go to school, I wasn’t able to play sports, so I really just locked myself in my room.” Not only did Mayhugh have to deal with the diagnosis, but he also had to get to grips with side-effects from his medication, like fatigue, dizziness, and mood swings. As his health stabilized however, the young upstart set about convincing his coaches that he could play soccer one again. “For months on end, I just walked back and forth in a straight line in my room,” he explains, in an effort to hide the limp in his left leg. “I had to change the way I played,” he adds. “I had to be more cautious and not put my head in situations that I usually would.” Mercifully, becoming active again would boost Mayhugh’s confidence, and with his family supporting him and his renewed sense of purpose, the young athlete began to blaze a trail. Firmly back behind a soccer ball and making the U.S. Para 7-a-side National Team, Mayhugh decided to take his running skills and apply them to track and field. His Paralympic debut came at the delayed Tokyo games in 2021, and he smashed it , sprinting to a 100m and 200m world record, and earning an additional gold in the mixed 4x100m relay, plus a silver in the 400m run. Mayhugh’s success would be a double-edged sword however, as officials later reclassified him to a less impaired category, moving him from T37 to T38. That move put the athlete in a more difficult class as he headed into the Paris World Championships in 2023. Still, despite the added pressure, Mayhugh was still able to take the podium with a bronze for the 100m sprint. It wasn’t gold though, and Mayhugh reveals that he found himself depressed at his perceived drop in the standings in Paris, feeling further disappointed that his classification was changed because of his earlier results. “That had kind of a negative effect on me,” he reflects, but Mayhugh also notes that this has been a time where he’s learned to put his life into perspective, appreciating the things that he has accomplished, while striving for more medals but not letting sports become the be-all and end-all of everything. “I’m in a way better place now than I was,” he shares, adding that he’s incredibly motivated for the upcoming 2025 Para Athletics Would Championships in New Delhi, India. As a keen long jumper, Mayhugh jumped his personal best with 6.19 meters during the 2024 U.S. Paralympic Trials ,  and so he will compete in both the T38 long jump and the T38 100m spring this September at those championships in India. It’s part of his plan to become the best possible athlete at the 2028 LA Paralympic Games.  A post shared by Nick Mayhugh (@nickmayhugh)  While cerebral palsy is a permanent neurological condition, “there’s a lot you can do,” explains Mayhugh, offering hope to those who also suffer. Indeed, a scientific review conducted in 2020 concluded that , “High-quality evidence indicates that resistance training can improve muscular strength in individuals with CP, with some preliminary evidence of structural and neurological adaptations.” While strength and conditioning is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and must be tailored to the individual, most experts agree that exercise provides mental and physical benefits. “Everyone’s diagnosis is different. There’s no two alike. Will I ever run as fast as Noah Lyles? Absolutely not, and that’s alright,” says Mayhugh. “But as long as I’m pushing myself and my left side to that physical capability on and off the track, and in the gym and strength training, it’s about trying to do a little more than I think I can.” The inspirational athlete says that while he cannot fix his brain damage, he can try to improve his abilities through repetition, encouraging his mind-muscle connection to fire as quickly as possible. “It’s very frustrating for someone who just wants to be perfect,” he admits, noting that he’s forced to contend with the annoyance of dropping a dumbbell from time to time, but Mayhugh has also found that resistance training is a great tool for the track. The sport’s star says that isometric exercises, where one set of muscles is used in opposition with another, like bicep curls or planks are of huge benefit. Mayhugh also undertakes a lot of unilateral work, using one arm or one leg to help with his symmetry. “I love Bulgarian split squats, that’s one thing that I do almost every day,” he shares. “Not even with weight, I’ll just try to see how long I can hold a single leg RDL, or anything that I can try — just to load my left side a little more to help with my balance.” Mayhugh has also found that receiving small physical taps on his unresponsive areas helps to activate his muscles. “One of the things that really frustrates me is I can’t feel my left glute,” he reveals. “So, when I’m in the starting blocks, and I try to push out, or when I’m striding, driving, running, those frontside mechanics, I’m trying to activate my glutes, but I can’t feel my left glute, so it’s hard for me to really use it.” To assist with activation, his coaches take a finger and tap the area in need of a response. When on his own in the gym, Mayhugh explains that he takes a finger and taps his glute, or his hamstring, or his arms during those bicep curls, and this helps with making his contractions. To further work on his balance, Mayhugh strengthens his Achillies and lower legs with calf raises. Looking straight ahead to India, Nick Mayhugh is not only proud of the progress that he’s made during his own experience with cerebral palsy but he’s also helped to raise money and awareness so that others may get the support that they need to follow in his fast footsteps. This athlete has always worn his disability as a badge of honor. Whether he’s wearing the pattern of a brain scan in his hair or posting motivational messages on social media, Mayhugh understands the power of making positive choices. “I always encourage people to just be gentle with themselves, you know?” he tells M&F. “To know that it is okay to not be okay, and that’s my biggest message. Nobody’s perfect by any means but as long as you’re doing something every day to better the situation that you’re in, then life will get better.” To follow Nick Mayhugh on Instagram, click here.

All data syncs automatically to Polar Flow— a free app. Perhaps best of all, the Loop is a one-time purchase with no hidden fees or subscription requirements. Your activity, sleep and recovery data stay yours and you can view, export or permanently delete it whenever you choose, with no paywalls or upsells. Retailing $199.99, the Loop device is available in your preferred colorway. Choose from Greige Sand, Night Black, or Brown Copper. Pre-orders for the Polar Loop are available now, with the screen-free, subscription-free wearable shipping from September 10. Visit Polar.com for info.

But what works for 25-year-old athletes doesn’t always apply to women in their 40s. In fact, traditional fasting protocols can backfire—disrupting hormones, draining energy, and stalling fat loss. That’s why Board Certified Functional Diagnostic Nutrition Practitioner Dani Conway has been teaching a smarter, more personalized method for over 18 years: fuel before you fast. As the founder of Nutrition the Natural Way , Expert Clinician Dani Conway specializes in helping women over 40 lose weight, balance hormones, and restore gut health through bioindividual nutrition, functional testing and cutting-edge protocols. Her clients include active women across Australia and the U.S. who are ready to optimize metabolism and rebalance hormones,  without sacrificing strength or sanity.  Hormone shifts—especially those related to estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, and insulin—can make a woman’s body more sensitive to stress. And fasting, by nature, is a hormetic stressor, which can be a good thing OR a bad thing! And when done without proper preparation, it can spike cortisol and trigger a cascade of negative effects: Imagine a 47-year-old woman named Claire living in Melbourne. She’s always been active—loves her weekend hikes and is meticulous about her diet. But lately, she’s been struggling with stubborn weight gain, energy crashes, and sleep that never quite feels restorative. Like many women in midlife, Claire is navigating the complex hormone shifts of perimenopause. When she attempted a popular intermittent fasting regimen, things got worse: increased irritability, cycles that were already irregular got worse, and a weight plateau in her progress. Women in midlife are already under enough internal stress from changing hormone levels. Adding poorly timed fasting—especially without metabolic prep—only compounds that hormone chaos. Dani Conway’s approach flips the script. Instead of jumping into a 16:8 or OMAD fast, she ensures her clients are metabolically ready by “fueling before fasting.” This method includes: This “fueling-before-fasting” method supports stable blood sugar, enhances lean muscle preservation, and improves metabolic flexibility—all without sending the body into a negative stress response. In Dani’s Weight Loss Accelerator Program , active women in their 40s and 50s are dropping fat, building muscle, and gaining long-term energy—without sacrificing their favorite foods or workouts. Her clients are runners, CrossFitters, yoga enthusiasts, and busy professionals who finally feel aligned with their bodies. Consider a typical midlife woman who’s been dedicated to her fitness routine but notices that things she did in the past aren’t working anymore! After years of managing belly fat and low energy, she tries the ‘fueling-before-fasting’ method and begins to notice significant changes: her energy levels stabilize, afternoon crashes disappear, and fat loss resumes without sacrificing strength or well-being. “Test, don’t guess” is one of Conway’s core mantras, and she goes above and beyond with her one on one clients. She uses functional testing – comprehensive bloodwork, hormone and gut health panels to personalize every one on one clients’ plan. This includes identifying: It’s this level of precision that sets her apart from generic fasting influencers. Her protocols are science-backed and results-driven, designed to optimize—not punish—the female metabolism. Intermittent fasting isn’t wrong—it just needs to be done differently. With the right strategy, women over 40 can tap into its fat-burning benefits without crashing their hormones. Whether you’re training for your next comp or simply want to feel strong again, the key is metabolic preparation—not starvation.  In fact, Conway’s mantra is, “STOP STARVING and start living!” Want to learn more?

Unlike other sports Halls of Fame, the ISHOF crosses over into several different sports, strength culture, and fitness. The ISHOF also recognizes athletes their members for their success in their sport as well as for their contributions, service, and philanthropic efforts to help others. Past inductees read like a Who’s Who across the world of sports, with names such as Lou Ferrigno, Randy Couture, Ronda Rousey, Kurt Angle, and Earl “The Pearl” Monroe being honored. Bodybuilding legends Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, Phil Heath, and Lenda Murray have joined them as members in the ISHOF throughout the years.  The Global Advisory Board of the ISHOF has formally announced the list of inductees elected for the Class of 2025, and the six legends represent multiple sports and fitness disciplines.  A post shared by Robert Goldman (@drrobertgoldman)  The recognition of various sports legends and champions has become an annual tradition. Eight-time Figure Olympia champion Cydney Gillon joins Murray and Cory Everson as the only female Olympia champions to be inducted into the ISHOF (the ISHOF now has 58 Olympia championships across all inducted champions). She is the only bodybuilding representative in the 2025 class. Gillon ran track in college at the University of Pennsylvania before making her presence known in the sport of bodybuilding. She was also cast in Survivor: Kaôh Rōng, finishing the show and competition in fourth place. Since 2017, Gillon has been the face of the Figure division. She retired from competition in 2024 following her eighth Olympia victory but still works in the fitness industry as a show promoter, coach, and trainer. That résumé will now include Hall of Famer. Super Bowl XI MVP Fred Biletnikoff was a college standout at Florida State before playing 14 seasons for the Oakland Raiders His precision while running routes made the wide receiver a primary target. Biletnikoff was named an All Pro four times. He also spent one season in the Canadian Football League before retiring in 1980. Biletnikoff was a member of the Class of 1991 for the College Football Hall of Fame and named on The Sporting News list of 100 Greatest NFL Players in 1999. His contributions to football go beyond the field. He founded Tracey’s Place of Hope in Loomis, California, a shelter for domestic violence victims and substance abuse treatment for females ages 14 to 18. Ryan Crouser is the first three-time Olympic gold medalist in the shot put , winning those honors in 2016, 2020, and 2024. The University of Texas alum started setting records in his sport going back to his high school days. As of 2025, Crouser holds the world record for longest outdoor put with a distance of 23.56 meters and longest indoor distance with a mark of 22.82 meters. Crouser is also a Jesse Owens Award recipient and was named Track & Field News World Male Athlete of the Year. He was involved in the creation of the World Shot Put Series, which began in April 2025, helping carry the sport forward both as a competitor and advocate. Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman is a three-time All-American from Old Dominion University and a two-time national champion. Considered by many to be one of the most important figures in women’s basketball history, “Lady Magic” was also a silver medalist in the Olympics and has two Wade Trophies to her credit. She has been a part of gold-medal winning teams for the United States in the 1975 Pan American Games and the 1979 World Championships in Seoul, South Korea. Lieberman became a part of basketball history by being the second assistant coach in the NBA when she worked on the Sacramento Kings’ bench from 2015 to 2017. She has also been a head coach in the WNBA, NBA G League, and the BIG3 League. She was the first female coach in the BIG3 to win a championship in 2018. Leigh Steinberg was the inspiration behind the iconic film “Jerry Maguire.” The sports agent, author, and philanthropist has represented over 300 athletes across multiple sports. The father of three holds the record for representing the most number one overall draft picks in the NFL with eight and represented several Hall of Fame legends. Steinberg is also revered for his philanthropy. His efforts have benefited the Human Relations Commission, Children Now, Children’s Miracle Network, Coro Fellows Program, and the Starlight Foundation. He was also the founder of Steinberg Leadership Institute (now Glass Leadership Institute), a nationwide program run by the Anti-Defamation League preparing students to fight racism and inequality throughout the world. “Superfoot” Grandmaster Bill Wallace’s name is synonymous with martial arts. He holds a 10th-degree black belt and the title of sōke (Grandmaster) in Shōrin-ryū karate. Among his accolades include being the PKA Professional World Full Contact Champion and World Middleweight Champion titles for six years. Wallace retired undefeated with a record of 23-0-0. Wallace is also the creator of “The Superfoot System,” a stretching methodology with Wallace’s kicking style and fighting approach. He has also worked as an actor in such films as “A Force of One” with Chuck Norris and “The Protector” with Jackie Chan. The induction ceremony for the Class of 2025 will take place on Saturday, Oct. 11 at the Resorts World in Las Vegas, NV as part of the 2025 Olympia Weekend . Goldman cherishes this annual event because of the people that are gathered to celebrate those being honored. Goldman had said in the past, “When you look around the room every year, you realize that it could be the last time you see them in the same place at the same time. That is a moment in time that will never happen again. That is what makes this event so special and memorable.” Details of how to attend the event have yet to be announced as of this writing. For more information, go to the ISHOF website and follow Goldman on Instagram. With Cbum gone, could Sommerfeld be the next Classic Olympia winner? The son of Quinton “Rampage” Jackson is being investigated by authorities. Vitaliy Ugolnikov will make mighty steps on bodybuilding’s biggest stage.",

Everyone seems to be waxing poetic about this macronutrient as it’s being hyped as the means to packing on more muscle and slashing hunger. Indeed, if you are focused on supporting muscle recovery and growth after hitting the gym, feeling less peckish following a meal, maintaining bones of steel, and keeping your immune system firing on all cylinders, then eating enough protein is crucial. So it’s a good thing that more people are becoming aware of their protein needs. This has left consumers on the hunt for easy ways to get more protein in their diet. And food and beverage manufacturers have taken notice. While protein bars and shakes are still out there in spades, more and more brands are adding protein to many unsuspecting foods. Protein-packed spaghetti and high-protein everything bagels. Chocolate chip cookies with as much protein as a trio of eggs. Watermelon flavored protein gels. Vanilla glazed donuts with 20 grams of protein. Fruity-tasting protein soda. Yes, we are in a golden era of protein-enhanced food. I won’t be surprised if I get a pitch sometime soon for a protein crusted frozen fish fillet or protein-enhanced carrot sticks. It’s never been easier to eat heaps of protein.  Despite all the hoopla, we need to proceed with caution when it comes to the crazy world of protein-rich, on-the-go foods. Not all foods and drinks boosted with protein are what you should be eating. Here’s what you need to know about the products beefed up with protein and how to figure out if you should go all-in. Spoiler alert: Foods that are naturally high in protein without a helping hand from food producers are still the best muscle-makers money can buy. Yes, these protein-enhanced foods make it easier to get the necessary amount of this muscle-making macro, but that doesn’t mean you have to pay up for them. As a general rule, active people who are keen on building lean body mass should aim to take in 1.6 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That is 130 to 163 grams of protein for a 180 pound guy. So, yes, that is a sizable amount of protein you need to stuff in every day to hone your physique. But certainly not impossible if you make sure to eat sufficient amounts of protein-dense foods like chicken, eggs, fish, tofu, and Greek yogurt at your meals and snacks. And perhaps a scoop or two of protein powder into your shakes. If you do this, then the need for expensive protein-boosted foods is less pressing. After all, before all these products hit the market somehow we got by without suffering the perils of protein deficiency. Arnold did not have access to bread with 8g of protein in a slice. The upshot is that you should try to accurately calculate your daily protein intake and then use this information to better understand your need, or not, for foods that are jacked up with extra protein. Perhaps protein chips and steak aren’t created equal. A recent analysis of a lofty 1,641 protein bars published in the journal Scientific Reports found that the quality of protein in most bars on the market is far from ideal for building muscle. For the study, researchers analyzed the protein content, source, and nutritional quality of numerous widely available protein bars. Although 81% of the protein bars analyzed were considered high in protein from sources like whey and soy, when the protein sources were processed into bar form, digestibility typically dropped significantly. The study authors surmise that the low numbers can be attributed to the use of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibers that may deteriorate the bioaccessibility of essential amino acids. So 20 grams of protein from a bar may not be equivalent to the same amount of the macro from a hunk of chicken. Another reason to focus on eating mostly whole food sources of protein. Certainly, research like this should make us question the protein quality of certain processed foods like bars. For good reason, we have associated protein with health, but this is certainly not always the case. Just because a product as amped up their protein does not make it a nutritional hero. Never forget that protein can be just one aspect of a food. If a protein-fortified food or beverage is also laced with added artificial sweeteners, sugars, refined grains, abundant fat calories, emulsifiers, salt, and an assortment of tongue-twisting additives then you have to start questioning whether that extra protein is worth the overall nutrition cost. For instance, I’ve come across some high-protein cereals that have more grams of added sugars than grams of protein. Protein pretzels with plenty of refined grains and sodium can still be considered ultra-processed, despite giving you way more protein than your standard ballpark option. Do your due diligence and read package labels carefully to make sure all that protein doesn’t come with too much nutritional baggage. Not all foods advertised as being a protein heavyweight are true to their marketing. It’s easy to find so-called protein bars, protein granola, and protein candy that don’t deliver much more than the normal option. Protein has become a marketing term and some brands are leaning heavily on this without delivering the goods. Don’t believe the front-of-the-package hype until you determine for yourself how much protein the product has. There is no regulated amount of protein that a product has to contain before saying it is ‘high-protein’, but sage advice is that a protein-fortified food or drink should give you at least 8 to 10 grams in a serving. These protein-enhanced foods don’t sacrifice nutrition to go bigger on the muscle-sculpting macro. Nutrition (1 pouch): 340 calories, 10g fat, 49g carbs, 11g fiber, 20g protein, 240mg sodium This no-cooking-required overnight muesli-oatmeal hybrid is a nutritional giant. Each pouch of oats, which you only need to dump into a jar or bowl and soak in milk for a few hours, has an impressive 20 grams of plant-based protein and 11g of dietary fiber from sources like chia seeds. There is even some probiotics in the fold to give your gut a boost. Plus, the product is low in added sugar, letting the dried fruit carry most of the sweetness. And the chocolate flavor makes it a crave-worthy breakfast. The great balance of carbs and protein makes this a good option for post-gym recovery nutrition. Oikos Pro Plain Nutrition (3/4 cup): 160 calories, 3.5g fat, 6g carbs, 0g fiber, 25g protein, 60mg sodium The inclusion of whey protein gives this yogurt even more of the macro than most Greek versions on the market. Plus, it’s deliciously thick without including any thickening agents and delivers just the right amount of tang. The plain flavor means there are no added sugars. Unbun Protein Seeded Bread Nutrition (2 slices): 160 calories, 4.5g fat, 22g carbs, 19g fiber, 22g protein, 430mg sodium This isn’t your standard slice of doughy white sandwich bread. The bread is made with milk protein isolate and whey protein concentrate to help turn your lunch sandwiches and morning toast into a protein powerhouse. There are no refined grains or added sugar, a rarity in the commercial bread industry. And the fiber levels are off-the-charts. Just something to keep in mind if your gut isn’t used to eating high-fiber foods. If this is the case, you may want to ease into the product by starting with a single slice at a time. Felicia Red Lentil Penne Nutrition (3.5 oz): 340 calories, 1.5g fat, 65g carbs, 12g fiber, 26g protein, 0mg sodium This shaped pasta is made with organic red lentil flour instead of wheat flour giving, it a serious protein and fiber advantage. And this dynamic duo makes the noodles extra satiating. When prepared as instructed, the texture doesn’t suffer. Consider this your path to next-level pasta salad. Press blend on these recipes and get ready to boost your protein shake game. With grilling season upon us, check out this list of healthy, protein-packed BBQ meats.

    "combined_text": "German Volume Training: A Muscle-Building Method Explained\n\nGerman Volume Training, or GVT for short, has been called everything from “brutal” to “the fastest way to pack on muscle” to “a one-way ticket to DOMS city.” If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to push through a high-volume workout that leaves your muscles screaming for mercy and your shirt sleeves feeling tighter, this [&#8230;]\n\nGerman Volume Training, or GVT for short, has been called everything from “brutal” to “the fastest way to pack on muscle” to “a one-way ticket to DOMS city .” If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to push through a high-volume workout that leaves your muscles screaming for mercy and your shirt sleeves feeling tighter, this old-school method delivers that. It started with the German Olympic weightlifting team in the 1970s. GVT became known for its simplicity: choose a big lift , perform 10 sets of 10 reps, and let the volume push your body to grow. No gimmicks, just a high volume and the grit to push through it. Here, we’ll explain exactly what GVT is, who it’s best suited for, its pros and cons, and, if you’re ready, provide a sample workout so you can see if you have what it takes to handle this physical and mental challenge.  German Volume Training was popularized in the 1970s by German national weightlifting coach Rolf Feser as a method to help lifters advance to a higher weight class during the off-season. The premise was unforgiving but straightforward—expose the muscles to an extreme amount of work in a short period to force rapid hypertrophy. In North America, strength coach Charles Poliquin brought GVT into the spotlight in the 1990s, writing about it and refining it for modern lifters. His adaptations preserved the essence of the program—high volume, controlled rest, and a laser focus on compound lifts—while making it more accessible to gym-goers outside the competitive weightlifting world. At its core, German Volume Training is about one thing—overloading your muscles with volume so they have no choice but to grow. The key number? 10 sets of 10 reps for a single big, compound movement. Here’s what makes it tick: The combination of high volume, controlled rest, and focused exercise selection creates an environment that enhances both physical strength and mental resilience. The program is best suited for: If you’re new to lifting, short on time, or still mastering the basics, this method is like trying to run a marathon before you’ve jogged a mile. Before trying any new program, even ones that have been around for over 50 years, like German Volume Training, it pays to weigh up your pros and cons, so you know if it’s right for you. GVT is excellent for a short, focused hypertrophy phase when your recovery is optimal. If you’re looking for maximum strength or are already low on sleep and stressed, a moderate-volume plan with more extended rest periods is the better choice.  If you’ve made it this far and are still eager to give GVT a try, start with this 6-week workout, which focuses on the basics. Split: 3 days per week with a full-body emphasis over the week. Main Lift: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM. Rest: Upper body: 60 to 90 seconds between sets Lower body: 90 to 120 seconds between sets Progression: When you hit all 10×10 with good form, increase the load by 2–3% the following week. Accessory Work: Keep it light, around 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps. 1. Back or Front Squat: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM, (90 to 120 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Romanian Deadlift: 3 sets, 10–12 reps @80% 1 RM 2B. Ab Rollout: 3 sets, 6-10 reps 1. Barbell Bench Press Variation: 10 sets 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Pull-Up (weighted if possible): 3 sets, 6–10 reps 2B. Stability Bent-Over Reverse Fly: 3 sets, 10–15 reps (per side) 1. Trap-Bar Bent-Over Row: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Conventional or Trap Bar Deadlift: 3 sets, 6 reps 2B. Isometric Elevated Split Squat: 3 sets, 30-45 sec. per side Weeks 1–2: Focus on good form and completing all sets and reps. Weeks 3–4: Once you hit 10×10, add weight (2-5 pounds for upper-body exercises and 5-10 pounds for lower body exercises). Weeks 5–6: Push yourself to the upper end of your capacity if you meet all your reps in week four and add weight. If the increase is too much, you can decrease the weight during your working sets. Mobility and stretching on off days are crucial for staying injury-free. Wasn’t that fun? The rise of the hybrid athlete continues with this multi-faceted approach to fitness. These guidelines can make the difference in helping protect your workout partner from injury. Master this final piece to the physique puzzle and take your gains to the next level.",

The Olympia contender went on to note that while he doesn’t feel old at 31 years of age, he has noticed how his body responds to junk foods when compared to his younger days. “Not being in my 20s anymore, when I start eating like s**t, I feel it pretty f*****g hard,” revealed the 2025 New York Pro winner.  To combat his cravings, Walker now opts for healthier foods to make him feel full without the nasties. “Just give me some cream of rice, some fruit, and I’m good,” he explained. “I don’t need nothing else.”  A post shared by Nick \"the Mutant\" Walker (@nick_walker39)  In the video, Walker doubled down on his love of fruit, particularly the frozen kind. “I prefer for the majority of my fruits, except bananas sometimes, I prefer frozen fruit over fresh fruit,” he shared. When it comes to bananas, The Mutant’s reluctance to freeze them likely stems from the fact that bananas can brown, losing their structure and taste during the freezing process. Still, there’s a scientific reason that he likes to freeze the rest his fruit, and it’s not just about taste. “Studies have shown that frozen fruits are actually fresher than ‘fresh,’” said Walker. And, to a large extent, the big man is correct. Science has indeed shown that freezing fruit can have a positive effect on vitamin E content while preserving the same levels of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron found in fresh fruits. This is because the nutritional value of ‘fresh’ fruit will very much depend on a number of factors such as when the fruit was harvested. Keep your diet on the right path by stocking your fridge with these freezable produce. Fresh fruit that is transported or stored for longer periods of time can lose its value whilst frozen fruits have their nutrients locked in during peak ripeness. The vitamin C level degrades in fresh fruit over time as well. But, that’s not to say biting into a fresh, juicy apple, or enjoying that succulent banana should be ‘cancelled.’ There’s also a faux pas that you can make with choosing frozen fruits: To get the most from your frozen fruit, avoid pre-sweetened options or ‘blends’ that may add hidden sugars and syrups to your eating regime. For Walker, however, frozen is the way to go. “I will take frozen blueberries over fresh, any day of the week,” he concluded, and was met with a ton of support in his IG comments. “I absolutely agree,” wrote one follower. “Frozen fruits are better 95% of the time.” Perhaps the likeminded fan knocked 5% off because of some badly frozen bananas? Either way, The Mutant’s current progress has him looking seriously peeled! To follow Nick Walker on Instagram, click here. The 2024 Bigman Pro Spain winner is coming strong into the 2025 Olympia.

Here’s what we know so far. Scientists searching for a more natural approach to fat loss than inconvenient injections or invasive surgery have developed a microbeads made from green tea polyphenols, vitamin E, and seaweed that binds to fats in the gastrointestinal tract, providing hope that that a scientifically sound weight loss drink such as a cup of microbead-filled-tea could turn the tide on obesity. “Losing weight can help some people prevent long-term health issues like diabetes and heart disease,” says Yue Wu, who tested the beads during an initial study involving rats, with her team at Sichuan University in China. “Our microbeads work directly in the gut to block fat absorption in a non-invasive and gentle way,” she explains . To begin the breakthrough, Wu’s team designed and constructed the plant-based microbeads as a form of “chemical tether” that binds to fat droplets and prevents them from being absorbed by the body. Apparently, the beads are almost flavorless, meaning that they could be mixed with a variety of food and drink products to limit our fat intake in the future. While this welcome invention has only been tested on rats for now, the results have been exciting to say the least. Rats tested with the microbeads had: Additionally, no side-effects were observed as a result of consuming the beads. “All the ingredients are food grade and FDA-approved, and their production can be easily scaled up,” says Yunxiang He, who is an associate professor and was a co-author on Wu’s presentation. The team behind the fat binding microbeads have announced that they’ve already begun work with a biotech company to progress larger scale manufacturing, and they have initiated human clinical trials too, meaning that this natural weight loss solution could one day hit the shelves. “This represents a major step toward clinical translation of our polyphenol-based microbeads, following our foundational results,” says Wu. “We have officially enrolled 26 participants in our investigator-initiated trial, and we anticipate that preliminary data may become available within the next year.” We’ll drink to that!  A new study has pin-pointed the effects of the popular potato option. When it comes to walking, choose quality over quantity, says science.

And, as a longtime lover of landmine rows, 2025 could potentially be AJ’s year. Issues with Andrew Jacked’s music during his 2024 Olympia performance may have caused some temporary anguish, but the big man sill managed an impressive fifth place and continues to make landmine rows part of his mass building routine, as evidenced by multiple Instagram posts documenting his approach to training. “Nothing crazy, just another workout Sunday,” he recently quipped to his 853K IG followers, as he leaned into his most recent session.  Five strength coaches share their favorite moves for making massive gains. The landmine row is a compound movement from a joint friendly angle that doesn’t overstress the lower back, instead focusing on the middle and lower trapezius in the upper back, and the teres major in the mid back, plus the lats to the side. You’ll also be pulling with the arms, so the deltoids and biceps will be taxed as well.  With progressive overload , landmine rows are a great tool for getting into the muscle building state of hypertrophy, shaping the back and building an enviable physique.  A post shared by Chinedu Obiekea Andrew J (@andrewjacked)  This man mountain can often seen performing the landmine row, and his technique is clear: Jacked doesn’t jolt the barbell as he lifts his weight skywards, instead looking for a low and controlled motion to engage time under tension. He’s also sure to maintain control of the plates on the negative, lowering the bar with the same precision as his lifts. To add landmine rows to your own muscle building arsenal , stand with your feet slightly turned out, a little more than shoulder feet apart for a brilliant base. Try to avoid rounding the back or hunching the shoulders too far forward, so that your spine remains neutral, and aim to fully extend your arms to really sink into the stretch. In his most recent video, Jacked uses drop sets for intensity, maintaining around 8 reps per set and lowering the weight until his muscles are fully exhausted. With this tireless approach to training, the rest of the Open division may need to keep a close eye on another potential upset at the 2025 Olympia event come October in Las Vegas.

Once [&#8230;]\n\nThis fall, fitness is about building complete athleticism. More lifters are proving you can chase strength in the weight room while building serious endurance on the road, bike, or rower. The hybrid athlete has arrived, and the movement shows no signs of slowing down. Hybrid training blends strength and endurance into one performance-focused system. Once thought of as conflicting goals, these qualities can be developed side by side with the right structure. The result is a body that looks powerful, performs across multiple domains, and stays resilient year-round.  The appeal goes beyond sport. Hybrid athletes aren’t training for one narrow outcome. They are developing strength, stamina, and adaptability that carry over into everything from competition to everyday life. To help you master both sides of the performance spectrum, Muscle & Fitness tapped Vincent DiPrimio, B.S. Exercise Science, CSCS, and Hybrid Performance Coach. He breaks down what hybrid training really is, why it’s blowing up right now, and how to structure your workouts this fall for maximum results. At its core, hybrid training is concurrent training: the practice of combining disciplines that don’t directly support one another. “The technical definition sometimes thrown around is ‘the concurrent training of different athletic disciplines that do not explicitly support one another, and whose disparate components are not essential to success at any one sport,’” says DiPrimio. In simpler terms, a hybrid athlete trains in two or more disciplines that don’t overlap in their adaptations. “For an easy example, compare powerlifting and ultramarathons. Both require completely different skill sets and physical qualities. The skill set needed to be good at one does not make you better at the other,” DiPrimio explains. “Yet a hybrid athlete who chooses to focus on these disciplines would work on training the qualities necessary to compete at both.” This is what separates hybrid training from more traditional fitness models. Bodybuilders chase size. Runners chase endurance. Powerlifters chase maximal strength. Hybrid athletes chase all of it; blending strength, stamina, and resilience to build the most versatile version of human performance. Hybrid training has been around for years, but its growth in recent seasons has been massive. DiPrimio points to four reasons: Variety with focus: Hybrid training offers more variety than powerlifting or bodybuilding, while still keeping attention on specific skills. Hyrox momentum: “It’s a quintessential hybrid event, where you combine strength, strength endurance, and multiple endurance modalities (running, ski erg, rower) into one event,” DiPrimio says. Hyrox has exploded globally and now serves as a showcase for hybrid athletes. CrossFit and obstacle course racing were early bridges into the space. Social media influence: Fitness creators have broadcast hybrid training to a massive audience across YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Accessibility and fun: “There are so many combinations of disciplines you could choose from across the endurance and strength worlds,” says DiPrimio. “There’s something for everyone. There’s always something to learn or improve upon, which keeps it fresh.” Hybrid training has shifted from niche to mainstream. More lifters want performance that carries across strength, speed, and endurance. This season is the perfect time to start. Hybrid athletes face a unique challenge: developing strength and endurance simultaneously without burning out. To do that, DiPrimio outlines five non-negotiable principles that guide every successful program. 1. Consolidate stressors: Pair your hardest efforts together and your easiest efforts together. For example, schedule heavy lifting sessions and sprint intervals earlier in the week, then place accessory lifts and steady-state cardio near the end. This structure allows your body to recover more effectively while still improving multiple qualities. 2. Less is more: Training for two demanding disciplines is taxing. Every exercise, set, and intensity level must earn its place in the program. “If it isn’t directly helping you improve in the disciplines you’re training for, take it out,” says DiPrimio. Focus on quality over quantity. 3. Leverage pre-fatigue: Strategic sequencing can shorten training time and trigger specific adaptations. For example, lifting for hypertrophy before a long run depletes glycogen stores. That run then doubles as a low-energy endurance session, forcing your body to adapt to running on limited fuel. 4. Attack weak links first: Break down the demands of your chosen sports and train your weakest areas with precision. Stronger athletes may need more running economy. Endurance athletes may need to raise their strength base. Identifying and addressing gaps keeps progress balanced. 5. Apply the SAID principle: Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands (SAID) means you must train the exact qualities you want to improve. If your goals are a powerlifting meet and a marathon, your program must include heavy squats, benches, and deadlifts along with structured running sessions. Cross-training can help beginners, but the further you progress, the more specific your training needs to be. Hybrid training works when you manage fatigue as carefully as you manage the lifts and miles themselves. The body can only recover from so much stress, so programming structure becomes the key to progress. Prioritize Rest Days: Every hybrid athlete needs recovery built into the week. Advanced athletes can often handle one full rest day with an additional light active recovery day. Intermediates should take one to two full rest days. Beginners benefit from two to three full rest days. Active recovery options include walking, mobility work, yoga, or light cycling. Use Body-Part Recovery: Recovery doesn’t always mean complete rest. If you hit heavy squats and sprint intervals on Monday, you can train upper body strength on Tuesday while your legs recover. By cycling stress across different muscle groups, you keep training frequency high without overworking the same systems. Consolidate Stressors: Place your high-intensity, low-volume work, like heavy barbell lifts or intervals, earlier in the week. Then save high-volume, low-intensity sessions, like steady-state cardio or accessory hypertrophy work, for the back half of the week. This sequence maximizes recovery while targeting the right adaptations at the right time. Match Training to Adaptations: High-intensity work drives strength, power, speed, and VO₂max. Low-intensity work builds aerobic capacity, movement economy, and resilience. Each has its place, but their placement matters. Structure your week so both qualities improve without interfering with one another. The balance comes from planning. You can’t chase everything every day. Align your most strenuous efforts, give your body time to recover, and then build the base work that keeps your engine running. Here’s how to put the principles into action. This four-day hybrid program blends heavy lifting, conditioning intervals, and long steady-state work into a balanced week. It uses consolidation of stressors (hard work paired with hard work, base work paired with base work) while leaving room for recovery. 1. Box Jump: 3 sets, 5 reps 2. Barbell Back Squat: 4 sets, 5 reps (~85% 1RM, 1–2 reps in reserve) 3. Romanian Deadlift: 4 sets, 8 reps 4A. Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 3 sets, 10 reps (each leg) 4B. Deadbug: 3 sets, 10 reps (each side) 1. Dynamic Warm-Up: 10 minutes (jogging, skips, plyos, technique drills) 2. Build-Up Accelerations: 1×10 yd, 1×20 yd, 1×30 yd (walk back recovery) 3. 800m Repeats : 6 reps at ~5% faster than race pace, 1:1 work-to-rest ratio 1. Plyo Push-Up : 3 sets, 5 reps 2. Bench Press: 4 sets, 5 reps (~85% 1RM, 1–2 reps in reserve) 3. One-Arm Dumbbell Row: 4 sets, 8 reps (each side) 4A. Weighted Chin-Up: 4 sets, 8 reps 4B. Kettlebell Overhead Reverse Crunch : 4 sets, 8 reps Options: easy walk, light cycling, yoga, or complete rest. 1. Broad Jump: 3 sets, 2 reps 2. Deadlift: 4 sets, 3 reps(~90% 1RM, 1 rep in reserve) 3A. Seated Barbell Overhead Press: 3 sets, 12 reps 3B. Dumbbell Walking Lunge: 3 sets, 12 reps (each leg) 4A. Chest-Supported Dumbbell Row: 3 sets, 12 reps 4B. Barbell Hip Thrust: 3 sets, 15 reps 4C. Half-Kneeling Cable Chop: 3 sets, 8 reps 1. Dynamic Warm-Up: 10 minutes (jogging, skips, plyos, technique drills) 2. Tempo Run: 30 minutes at race pace Friday: Rest or Active Recovery Options : mobility, Zone 1 cycling, or full rest. Saturday: Long Steady-State (LSD) Run 1. Dynamic Warm-Up: 10 minutes (jogging, skips, plyos, technique drills) 2. Steady-State Run: 60 minutes at Zone 2 pace (conversational effort) Sunday: Rest Take a full rest to reset for the upcoming week. Monday/Tuesday pairs heavy lifting with intervals to drive strength and high-intensity adaptations. Thursday/Saturday balance hypertrophy and long aerobic conditioning for volume and movement economy. Recovery days ensure your nervous system, muscles, and joints reset. DiPrimio emphasizes that the key to hybrid training is sustainability. Each workout serves a purpose, every rest day is earned, and the structure allows you to train hard without breaking down. It’s time for a refresher course on this old-school size-gaining method. These guidelines can make the difference in helping protect your workout partner from injury. Master this final piece to the physique puzzle and take your gains to the next level.",

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Few things feel more invigorating than lacing up your hiking boots and exploring a new trail . From the sun-drenched days of summer to crisp autumn afternoons, hiking connects you with nature while feeding the mind, body, and soul. The newest trend to hit the trails? “Soft hiking,” which is all about keeping things light and intentional. We spoke with experts to learn six soft hiking techniques that actually build more strength than gym workouts after 45. Soft hiking emphasizes moving with purpose at a comfortable pace. You’re still challenging your body while weaving through uneven terrain and engaging your muscles without excessive load. “It uses less intense and slower therapeutic movements, balance, and resistance to natural bodyweight instead of high-impact movements,” says Shahinaz Soliman, MD , board-certified family physician with 20+ years of experience in patient care. “This modality is appropriate in people over 45 because it encourages building strength at a long-term, low-risk level that honors joint health and recovery requirements.” Inclines introduce a fresh challenge to your hike. Choose easy upward slopes while keeping your step-ups slow and steady. “This is a natural increase of glutes, hamstrings, and calves without the use of heavy weights,” says Soliman. Why People Are Ditching Regular Walks for ‘Nordic Walking’ Navigating objects like rocks and logs is another way to instantly boost the effectiveness of your hike. “The introduction of natural obstacles promotes the use of stabilizer muscles that are not given serious attention in gym machines,” Soliman says. 5 Walking Moves That Shrink Belly Fat Faster Than the Gym After 45 Don’t forget about working your arms! “Trekking poles or recreating arm movements will use upper body muscles and enhance overall coordination and calorie expenditure,” Soliman points out. Balaram Thapa , CEO of Nepal Hiking Team, notes to position the poles so that your elbows are near 90 degrees, and “plant-pull” with every step. Complete six sets of two-minute efforts on rolling ground, activating your core. When going downhill, descend slowly. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e “Slow, controlled [descent] is one of the most effective methods to strengthen quadriceps and enhance balance, compared to walking normally,” Soliman notes. Here’s How Long Your Incline Walking Workout Should Be To Shrink Belly Fat Weave some bodyweight exercises into your hike. The key is pausing and holding the movement. “Pause in lunge or half-squat poses a few times on the way to activate the core and leg muscles in the isometric mode with minimum load on the joints,” Soliman instructs. The #1 Walking Method To Shrink Belly Fat Fast After 50, According to a Trainer Thapa recommends hill repeats: climbing for three to four minutes, descending gradually, and repeating for four to six rounds in total. “Keep steps short, drive through the mid-foot, and breathe rhythmically,” Thapa says. According to Soliman, “Soft hiking combines various muscle groups dynamically and functionally in a natural setting, which puts greater pressure on the body as compared to isolated gym work. Balance, a controlled movement, and weight-bearing activities in uneven terrain encourage the neuromuscular coordination and stability of the joints.” Thapa says soft hiking loads various planes of movement. “[In addition, it] builds eccentric control, and [challenges] balance. You strengthen feet, ankles, knees, and hips together while protecting joints with self-selected pace and terrain.” Outdoor exercise promotes longer workout sessions and sustainability. In adults 45+, this equals safer strength gains and far less boredom that’s often associated with standard gym routines. Looking for easy ways to lose fat?

If you’re on a weight loss mission, your diet matters as much as hitting the gym. Being consistent with healthy meals plays a major part in dropping unwanted pounds and what you eat for dinner can make all the difference. While fad diets get a lot of attention on social media, trends don’t always deliver long-term results, but eating the right food does. To help kickstart your wellness journey, here are five dinners that are packed with flavor, nutrition and can help you slim down in 30 days, according to nutritionist Rania Batayneh , MPH author of the bestselling book, The One One One Die t. According to Batayneh, this salmon dish proves healthy and can also be quick and delicious. “Chilean salmon isa nutrition powerhouse, packed with omega-3 fats, vitamin D, and other nutrients that keeps your heart, brain, eyes, and joints happy. It is also one of the lowest-mercury seafood options and an FDA “Best Choice” for families. I often recommend,” She adds, “Chilean salmon because it delivers so much nutrition in a safe, affordable way. Keep a few frozen fillets on hand and you can have dinner on the table in minutes since they thaw in just 15 minutes. Served with asparagus and a tangy lemon dill yogurt sauce, this meal is fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.” Ingredients (Serves 2) 2 Chilean salmon fillets (4–5 ounces each) 1 bunch asparagus, bottoms trimmed 1 tbsp olive oil Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tbsp Greek yogurt 1 tbsp lemon juice 4 cherry tomatoes 1 tsp fresh dill, chopped Instructions 1. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Sear salmon skin-side down for 4–5 minutes, then flip and cook another 4–5 minutes, until cooked through. 2. In the same pan, sauté asparagus until tender. 3. Stir together Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and dill for the sauce. 4. Plate salmon with asparagus, spoon the sauce over top, and finish with cherry tomatoes. He Lost 100 Lbs After Stopping These 5 Eating Out Mistakes Protein 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e This Shrimp Fajita Bowl with Sorghum is a colorful, one-pan meal that layers shrimp, peppers, and onions over whole grain sorghum. Batayneh explains, “Sorghum is naturally gluten-free and provides essential nutrients including protein, fiber, iron, and antioxidants. As a source of fiber and resistant starch, sorghum helps regulate blood sugar levels, supports healthy digestion, and contributes to satiety. Finished with zesty spices, lime, and cilantro, this recipe is simple, flavorful, and nourishing. Ingredients (Serves 4) ½ cup dry whole grain sorghum (about 1½ cups cooked) 2 lbs shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 bell peppers, sliced 1 small red onion, sliced 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp cumin ½ tsp garlic powder Salt and pepper, to taste Fresh lime wedges and cilantro, for garnish Instructions 1. Cook sorghum according to package directions. 2. Toss shrimp, peppers, and onion with olive oil and spices. 3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and sauté until shrimp are pink andvegetables are tender, about 5–7 minutes. 4. Divide sorghum into bowls and top with shrimp and vegetables. 5. Garnish with lime and cilantro. Salmon is already a powerhouse of lean protein and omega-3 fats, but when you add pistachios, you boost both flavor and nutrition. “Pistachios bring plant-based protein, heart-healthy fats, and fiber to the plate, along with 30 vitamins and minerals,” says Batayneh.  “In this recipe, the jalapeño pistachios form a crunchy crust that pairs perfectly with the zesty cilantro-lime marinade, creating a dish that’s as nourishing as it is delicious. Roasted with potatoes, it’s a balanced meal that supports steady energy, satiety, and overall wellness.” Ingredients (Serves 4) 2 cups fresh cilantro 2 cloves minced garlic ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided Zest and juice of 1 lime 4 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1–1½ inches thick ½ cup jalapeño pistachios, divided 1½ pounds small potatoes, halved ½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided Instructions 1. Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. 2. Combine cilantro, garlic, ⅓ cup olive oil, lime zest, and lime juice in a small food processor and pulse until well combined. Transfer half to a large resealable bag and add the salmon. Remove air, seal, and marinate for 20 minutes in the refrigerator. 3. Add ¼ cup pistachios to the reserved marinade in the processor, pulse, and transfer to a bowl. Set aside. 4. Toss potatoes with ¼ teaspoon salt, ⅛ teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon oil. Spread on baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. 5. Remove sheet, stir potatoes, then move them to the sides. Remove salmon from marinade, tapping off excess, and place in center of pan, skin-side down. Discard marinade. Season with remaining salt and pepper. Bake until potatoes are tender and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. 6. Plate salmon and potatoes. Garnish with reserved pistachio mixture and remaining pistachios. This ABC Taco Salad is all about avocado, black beans, and cilantro. “Black beans bring plant-based protein and fiber that help keep you full and satisfied, while also providing key minerals like iron and magnesium,” Batayneh explains. She adds, “Creamy avocado steps in for cheese or sour cream, adding healthy fats and a rich texture. A squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro brighten the dish, making it as flavorful as it is nourishing.” Serve it as a hearty salad, enjoy it in warm corn tortillas, or pair it with rice for a balanced bowl. Ingredients (Serves 6) Cooking spray 2 cans (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained 1⁄4 cup water 2 avocados, peeled, pitted, and finely chopped 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup cilantro fresh, chopped 1⁄4 cup finely chopped sweet onion 1⁄4 teaspoon salt 3 limes, cut in half *6 corn tortillas (gluten-free)- optional Instructions: 1.

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Strength training after 40 might seem trickier than it was in your 20s and 30s, but the essence stays the same. It’s about staying powerful, protecting your joints, and building the kind of strength that supports everything from weekend activities to long-term health. Standing exercises are one of the best tools to get there. They engage your entire body, demand balance, and keep your core active while you move through strength-building patterns . Unlike traditional dumbbell routines that isolate one muscle group at a time, standing movements challenge multiple muscles together. This creates a stronger foundation for daily life and reduces your risk of injury. You’re not just training arms or legs—you’re training stability, coordination, and control in ways that carry over to real-world movement. The payoff is more than stronger muscles . Standing exercises improve posture, help protect your spine, and keep your hips, knees, and shoulders moving well as you age. That combination keeps you feeling younger, more capable, and less likely to deal with aches that slow progress. The six exercises ahead show how dumbbells can be used in creative ways that go beyond the basics. Each one builds strength that lasts, supports resilience, and helps you get more out of every workout after 40.  Side bends strengthen the often-neglected oblique muscles that protect your spine and improve rotational control. Past 40, building strength in the midsection goes beyond looks—it supports posture, protects your back, and helps you generate power in other lifts. Muscles Trained: Obliques, abdominals, erector spinae, hip flexors How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds. Best Variations: Suitcase carries, side planks with reach, kettlebell side bends Form Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked and avoid twisting your torso as you bend. 5 Power Exercises That Torch Belly Fat Faster Than Treadmill Workouts After 45  The push press builds explosive upper body strength while engaging the lower body for added support. It mimics athletic movement and teaches your body to transfer power from the ground up. After 40, this type of coordinated effort keeps your joints mobile and your muscles firing together.

Each of these moves combines calorie burn, muscle activation, and metabolic conditioning.

Something as simple as training with your own body weight can get real results. In fact, bodyweight exercises are “ more functional ,” recruiting a greater number of joints and muscles simultaneously, channeling everyday movement. That’s why we spoke with an expert who shares five daily bodyweight exercises that keep your body young , fit, and strong after 40. Keep in mind that “nothing changes without tension,” says Joy Puleo, M.A., NCPT , director of education at Balanced Body. “To create change and build muscle, you need to challenge the body by creating overload or tensioning the structure and it is the tension that leads to the desired adaptations, muscle strength and endurance.” These daily moves are effective because the way you position your body in relation to gravity promotes total-body toning and strengthening. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e “For example, with a pushup, the body is roughly parallel to the ground,” Puleo explains. “As the body lowers toward the ground, the work to maintain the plank posture is challenged as ground forces transfer from the upper body through the core to the legs, creating full body tension and overload. The closer to the ground the body goes, the harder the push away from the floor becomes, the more force the body must overcome the more strength and endurance that is created.” If You Can Do These 4 Bodyweight Exercises After 50, You’re Stronger Than 90% of Your Peers  “This is an isometric exercise—a static hold,” Puleo points out. “Studies are showing that isometric exercises build strength and endurance relatively quickly … Your posture is important here—your head, your ribcage, your pelvis through the legs to the heels should create a long, straight line. Maintaining this line is important to how the forces transfer from the upper body, through the core, to the legs.” These 6 Bodyweight Moves Build Core Strength Faster Than Planks After 40  “Dynamic exercises like planks change the body’s relationship to gravity while also moving multiple joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, and shoulder blades,” Puleo notes. “This increases muscle strength around moving joints, changes the way forces are put into and need to be responded to and teaches the nervous system how to coordinate movement relative to gravity.” ​​ 4 Daily Exercises That Reverse Muscle Loss Faster Than the Gym  The side plank is similar to a classic plank, but because you’re balancing on one arm and facing the side, your obliques and side body muscles require strength, endurance, and stability.  Squats are one of the most practical and powerful bodyweight moves. “They build strength, endurance and neuromuscular coordination of the lower body while integrating the legs with the core,” Puleo says. 3 Daily Movements That Keep Your Body 10 Years Younger After 44  “The lunge is directly related to walking and functional reciprocal leg motion,” Puleo tells us.
