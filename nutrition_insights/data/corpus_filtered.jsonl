Here’s what you need to know. The new study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition aimed to discover how the different compositions of meat could help or hinder our muscle building progress after physical activity. A research team based at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign looked at the effects of consuming high-fat pork, low-fat pork, and a carbohydrate meal for control purposes. The high-fat pork contained 20g protein with 20.6g of fat, while the low-fat pork contained the same 20g of protein but only 4.4g fat. The carbohydrate control had zero protein or fat. In all, sixteen physically active adults took part in the trial, and provided repeated blood samples and muscle biopsies at rest and after working out, to measure plasma variables.  The study found that both the high and low-fat pork options stimulated muscle protein synthesis as expected, but the lean pork produced a 47% greater effect than its fattier counterpart post-exercise. This is despite the fact that both pork options contained an identical amount of the same source of protein. “Our work demonstrated that other nutrients in the food matrix, beyond total ingested protein or Essential Amino Acids, can impact the regulation of Muscle Protein Stimulation in healthy adults,” concluded the report. Despite the small sample size, the data does give athletes a new decision to make regarding their post exercise meat intake. One theory is that the higher fat content led to slower digestion and a delayed synthesis of the protein into the blood. This could mean that overall protein synthesis remains the same or similar in both low and high-fat meats. Still, those looking for faster recovery post pump, or athletes engaging in multistage events like triathlon, might consider leaning into leaner meats to maximize the speed of protein synthesis. When it comes to muscle-building nutrition, think quality over quantity. Protein is everywhere in the grocery store, so it's time to learn what you're about to consume.

But is it all hype? The most recent research suggests collagen may not live up to the claims that permeate the fitness world . Dr. Layne Norton , Ph.D. in Nutritional Sciences, doubts collagen’s value. Collagen supplementation looks like a scam. I am skeptical. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, helping make up the skin, bones, tendons, ligaments , and cartilage. There are at least 16 types, but types I, II, and III are closely tied to fitness and joint /skin health. There are four main ways collagen works in the body: Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you?

Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. To separate fact from marketing, a 2023 randomized controlled trial from Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise examined how collagen supplementation affects muscle connective tissue protein synthesis after exercise. The findings showed that collagen ingestion during recovery did not increase connective tissue protein synthesis , suggesting that it may not enhance muscle and tendon repair the way some supplements claim. ( 1 ) A post shared by Jeremy L. Buendia (@jeremy_buendia) If muscle and connective tissue don’t benefit, what about skin? New evidence indicates collagen might not help skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles. A 2025 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials, including 1,474 participants, found improvements only in pharma-funded studies. In contrast, research not funded by pharmaceutical companies reported no significant benefits. ( 2 ) Excluding outlier studies, collagen supplements showed no significant improvements in wrinkles, hydration, or elasticity. Swapping collagen for whey protein might be the right move for strength, vitality, and muscle building . Whey protein consistently outperforms collagen in head-to-head comparisons for hypertrophy . ( 3 ) Research has shown no significant differences between whey and collagen for stimulating connective tissue synthesis, making collagen the inferior option for those seeking muscle growth or recovery benefits. ( 4 ) ( 5 ) “Collagen literally has the worst amino acid profile of any protein source on the market,” Dr. Norton asserted. “It is absurdly low in essential amino acids, specifically the branch chain amino acids and leucine, which stimulate muscle protein synthesis.” Everyone wants an edge in training, but high-quality research shows collagen’s effects on muscle and connective tissue are inconsistent. Its real-world impact on muscle growth, recovery, and skin health appears limited, leaving its effectiveness debatable.

However, many protein assemblies are prone to disruption under load, and susceptible to material fatigue. Acquisition of a fundamental knowledge on the relationship between structure and mechanical properties of protein assemblies may guide the engineering of protein nanostructures with a higher strength and resistance to fatigue. The capsid protein (CA) of the human immunodeficiency virus can self-assemble into a single molecule-thick, flexible nanoarray that can coat large surfaces. In this study, a genetic engineering strategy was used to individually remove in the CA protein array the side chain of 7 amino acid residues per subunit involved in intermolecular interactions. The effects of eliminating those side chains, and their intermolecular interactions, on the equilibrium dynamics, stiffness, strength, and resistance to fatigue of the CA nanoarray were quantified using atomic force microscopy. The results revealed that removal of different types of attractive intermolecular interactions (van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds, and/or ionic bonds), increased the conformational flexibility of the protein array, and decreased its stiffness and strength. In contrast, removal of a naturally occurring, repulsive charge-charge intermolecular interaction in the nanoarray actually led to dramatic increases in strength against point loads (by ∼60%) and resistance to fatigue (by ∼50%), without increasing its stiffness. These findings suggest a general genetic strategy to increase the intrinsic strength and resistance to fatigue of nanostructured protein materials, based on the optimization of the ionic interactions between subunits.", "relevance_score": 13.9068, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "protein", "strength"]}

This concept is likened to a \"cake,\" with specific timing of protein intake being merely \"a very thin layer of icing\" on that cake.\n\nThere’s a clear hierarchy where meeting your total daily protein needs takes precedence over everything else. This means that even if protein intake is not perfectly distributed across meals, for instance, a smaller amount in the morning and a much larger, protein-rich dinner, the body can still effectively utilise that protein for muscle building, provided the daily total is met. Don’t think you need to front-load 50% of your protein requirement immediately after your workout.\n\n# Optimal Daily Protein Intake for Muscle Building\n\nFor most individuals aiming to build muscle through resistance training, the recommended total daily protein intake is approximately **1.6 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight**, which translates to about **0.7 grams per pound of body weight**. Some recommendations suggest going up to 2 grams per kilogram, or roughly 1 gram per pound, but these don’t factor in lean muscle mass, so are likely higher than necessary. A meta-analysis of existing literature concluded that as long as total daily protein intake was at or above this range, **the specific timing of protein consumption relative to a workout did not significantly impact muscle gain**.\n\n# The \"Anabolic Window\" is Very Flexible\n\nThe traditional notion of a narrow \"anabolic window,\" which suggested consuming protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, largely originated from studies where subjects trained in a completely fasted state. However, this concept has limited relevance for most people who consume meals before their workouts. When a mixed meal is eaten pre-exercise, its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects can last anywhere from three to six hours, meaning that **nutrients are often still circulating in the bloodstream during and even after a training session**.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis found that if the total daily protein intake is sufficient, the **exact timing of protein relative to the training session makes no meaningful difference** for muscle gain. Furthermore, the actual physiological \"anabolic window\" for muscle protein synthesis is much broader than just a few hours; it **peaks approximately 24 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for as long as 48 to 72 hours**. This indicates that the body has an extended period to utilise available nutrients for muscle repair and growth.\n\n# Meal Timing and Protein Portion Sizes\n\nResearch demonstrates considerable flexibility in when and how much protein one consumes per meal. A study showed **no significant advantage** between consuming protein immediately before exercise versus immediately after. Building on this, another trial specifically examined what happens when individuals neglect all nutrients for three hours both before and after a resistance training bout, while still optimising total daily protein. The results showed **no significant or meaningful difference in muscle size and strength gains** compared to a group that consumed protein immediately around their workout. This means there is **tremendous flexibility** in fitting protein intake into a busy schedule. While studies suggest that doses of around **30 to 50 grams per meal (or 0.4 to 0.6 grams per kilogram of body weight / 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound of body weight)** appear to maximize muscle protein synthesis *per meal*, the body is also perfectly capable of effectively utilizing much larger protein amounts, such as **75 to 100 grams, from a single meal** for muscle protein synthesis. This is particularly helpful for individuals who find it more practical to consume a significant portion of their daily protein in one or two larger meals, such as dinner.\n\n# Nutrient Availability Trumps Ingestion Time\n\nThe crucial element for muscle protein synthesis is the **presence of nutrients in circulation**, not the precise moment those nutrients are ingested relative to your workout. Nutrients typically **peak in the bloodstream one to two hours after consumption**. Therefore, if you eat protein before a workout, those amino acids will become available in your system during or shortly after your training, ready for use by your muscles. This clarifies why a rush for immediate post-workout protein is often unnecessary, especially if a pre-workout meal has been consumed.\n\n\\---\n\nTaken from r / healthchallenges", "relevance_score": 10.0, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein", "recovery"]}

Due to lack of antiviral agents and significant adverse effects and less affordability of vaccines, the E-protein targeted drug development is gaining critical attention among the researchers. The present review explores the structural and genomic diversities of E-protein among animal viruses with special interest to flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses. E-protein's viroporin activity damages host cell membrane and induces inflammation that advances the disease progression. The review also explains the viroporin-mediated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs)-linked cellular mechanisms in virus-mediated inflammation. The E-protein is considered an alternative promising antiviral target as its functional domain is conserved. This review further enlists the natural, and synthetic inhibitors of E-protein in the development of antiviral agents based on computational, in vitro, and in vivo studies. The E-protein's universal conservation ability to fasten to cellular membranes and limited structural data imparts significant challenge to selective drug inhibition. The present review highlights that the E-protein together with multiple viral factors will boost treatment performance while minimising viral resistance. In addition, broad-range inhibitors targeting E-proteins have the potential to produce single treatment solutions in combating viral infections including several viral strains. In conclusion, E-protein targeted drug would be beneficial in developing potential antiviral agents with high drug specificity, and less viral resistance.", "relevance_score": 9.5627, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

Currently, there is still a lack of relevant treatments. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a vital tool for identifying druggable targets in skeletal muscle to develop T2DM treatments.\n\nMETHODS: Potential causative genetic factors in skeletal muscle and blood causally associated with T2DM were identified by SMR analysis. Bayesian colocalisation were used to validate causality. Pleiotropic impact of drug targets was assessed using phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR). Then, targeted overexpression or knockdown of AEBP1 in mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12) and human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) further validated the functional phenotype. Protein docking, co-IP and SPR were used to demonstrate protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Both European and Asian populations revealed that AEBP1 was significantly associated with T2DM and its glycemic profile in blood and skeletal muscle, and was identified as a risk factor. Co-localisation analyses suggest that AEBP1 and T2DM originate from the same genetic variants. Meanwhile, targeted AEBP1 therapy has no potential adverse effects. Furthermore, AEBP1 was significantly expressed in in vivo and in vitro IR models and was consistent with the SMR results. Overexpression of AEBP1 further impaired insulin signalling and glucose transport mechanisms, exacerbating skeletal muscle IR. Targeting AEBP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Protein interaction experiments revealed that PI3K (p110β) is a direct target protein for AEBP1 to exert molecular functions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeting AEBP1 therapy is expected to be a pivotal approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.", "relevance_score": 9.5169, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein"]}

While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the \"black box\" nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.", "relevance_score": 9.5125, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "quality"]}

However， conventional methods such as immunofixation electrophoresis （IFE） and western blotting （WB） suffer from complex workflows， time-consuming operations， and limited quantification capabilities owing to intricate staining and de-staining procedures. In addition， these traditional immunological detection methods require extensive manual handling and specialized expertise， while low levels of automation restrict their applicability to high-throughput or large-scale analysis scenarios. Moreover， the multistep nature of these methods increases the risk of experimental errors and compromises quantification accuracy.Herein， we present a quantitative protein immune polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis （PAGE） detection method that combines immune-recognition principles with online fluorescence imaging technology， thereby offering a rapid and specific approach for quantifying target proteins. The developed method exploits the specificity of fluorescently labeled antibodies and the separation capability of PAGE， with formaldehyde crosslinking used to stabilize antigen-antibody complexes under the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis， thereby ensuring reliable quantification. The entire experimental workflow can be completed within 1.5 h and consists of three main steps. Firstly， the target protein is incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies at room temperature for 0.5 h to form immune complexes， after which they are crosslinked using formaldehyde. The cross-linked samples are then loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and separated under optimized electrophoresis conditions （120 V， 15 min； 150 V， 15 min； 200 V， 15 min）. Electrophoretic separation is finally monitored in real-time using an online fluorescence imaging system， which enables direct visualization of protein migration and eliminates the need for post-separation processing. Three distinct bands are observed on the precast gel following immune PAGE separation： the immune complexes at the uppermost position， the free fluorescent antibodies in the middle， and other proteins at the bottom. ImageJ software is used to analyze the electrophoresis pattern， and quantification is achieved based on the linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the free antibody and the mass concentration of the target protein. We systematically validated the performance of the method using human transferrin （TRF） as the model antigen protein and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled （FITC-labeled） anti-TRF IgG antibody （anti-TRF IgG-FITC） as the detection probe， which involved analyzing three key aspects： the necessity of the formaldehyde-crosslinking step for maintaining immune complex stability， antibody recognition specificity in complex samples， and the linear correlation between the fluorescence signal and the mass concentration of the target protein. The method exhibited excellent analytical performance， with a linear range that extended between 5.0 and 200.0 mg/L and a correlation coefficient （", "relevance_score": 8.6156, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

The primary hypothesis of this study was that oxidative damage, caused in vivo by oxidative stress-a key factor in aging and various inflammatory diseases-deteriorates bone tissue quality by damaging bone collagen, the main component of the bone's organic phase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038). The hypothesis that physiological levels of oxidative damage generated in vitro degrade cortical bone mechanical properties by damaging the bone collagen has been confirmed.

Everyone seems to be waxing poetic about this macronutrient as it’s being hyped as the means to packing on more muscle and slashing hunger. Indeed, if you are focused on supporting muscle recovery and growth after hitting the gym, feeling less peckish following a meal, maintaining bones of steel, and keeping your immune system firing on all cylinders, then eating enough protein is crucial. So it’s a good thing that more people are becoming aware of their protein needs. This has left consumers on the hunt for easy ways to get more protein in their diet. And food and beverage manufacturers have taken notice. While protein bars and shakes are still out there in spades, more and more brands are adding protein to many unsuspecting foods. Protein-packed spaghetti and high-protein everything bagels. Chocolate chip cookies with as much protein as a trio of eggs. Watermelon flavored protein gels. Vanilla glazed donuts with 20 grams of protein. Fruity-tasting protein soda. Yes, we are in a golden era of protein-enhanced food. I won’t be surprised if I get a pitch sometime soon for a protein crusted frozen fish fillet or protein-enhanced carrot sticks. It’s never been easier to eat heaps of protein.  Despite all the hoopla, we need to proceed with caution when it comes to the crazy world of protein-rich, on-the-go foods. Not all foods and drinks boosted with protein are what you should be eating. Here’s what you need to know about the products beefed up with protein and how to figure out if you should go all-in. Spoiler alert: Foods that are naturally high in protein without a helping hand from food producers are still the best muscle-makers money can buy. Yes, these protein-enhanced foods make it easier to get the necessary amount of this muscle-making macro, but that doesn’t mean you have to pay up for them. As a general rule, active people who are keen on building lean body mass should aim to take in 1.6 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That is 130 to 163 grams of protein for a 180 pound guy. So, yes, that is a sizable amount of protein you need to stuff in every day to hone your physique. But certainly not impossible if you make sure to eat sufficient amounts of protein-dense foods like chicken, eggs, fish, tofu, and Greek yogurt at your meals and snacks. And perhaps a scoop or two of protein powder into your shakes. If you do this, then the need for expensive protein-boosted foods is less pressing. After all, before all these products hit the market somehow we got by without suffering the perils of protein deficiency. Arnold did not have access to bread with 8g of protein in a slice. The upshot is that you should try to accurately calculate your daily protein intake and then use this information to better understand your need, or not, for foods that are jacked up with extra protein. Perhaps protein chips and steak aren’t created equal. A recent analysis of a lofty 1,641 protein bars published in the journal Scientific Reports found that the quality of protein in most bars on the market is far from ideal for building muscle. For the study, researchers analyzed the protein content, source, and nutritional quality of numerous widely available protein bars. Although 81% of the protein bars analyzed were considered high in protein from sources like whey and soy, when the protein sources were processed into bar form, digestibility typically dropped significantly. The study authors surmise that the low numbers can be attributed to the use of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibers that may deteriorate the bioaccessibility of essential amino acids. So 20 grams of protein from a bar may not be equivalent to the same amount of the macro from a hunk of chicken. Another reason to focus on eating mostly whole food sources of protein. Certainly, research like this should make us question the protein quality of certain processed foods like bars. For good reason, we have associated protein with health, but this is certainly not always the case. Just because a product as amped up their protein does not make it a nutritional hero. Never forget that protein can be just one aspect of a food. If a protein-fortified food or beverage is also laced with added artificial sweeteners, sugars, refined grains, abundant fat calories, emulsifiers, salt, and an assortment of tongue-twisting additives then you have to start questioning whether that extra protein is worth the overall nutrition cost. For instance, I’ve come across some high-protein cereals that have more grams of added sugars than grams of protein. Protein pretzels with plenty of refined grains and sodium can still be considered ultra-processed, despite giving you way more protein than your standard ballpark option. Do your due diligence and read package labels carefully to make sure all that protein doesn’t come with too much nutritional baggage. Not all foods advertised as being a protein heavyweight are true to their marketing. It’s easy to find so-called protein bars, protein granola, and protein candy that don’t deliver much more than the normal option. Protein has become a marketing term and some brands are leaning heavily on this without delivering the goods. Don’t believe the front-of-the-package hype until you determine for yourself how much protein the product has. There is no regulated amount of protein that a product has to contain before saying it is ‘high-protein’, but sage advice is that a protein-fortified food or drink should give you at least 8 to 10 grams in a serving. These protein-enhanced foods don’t sacrifice nutrition to go bigger on the muscle-sculpting macro. Nutrition (1 pouch): 340 calories, 10g fat, 49g carbs, 11g fiber, 20g protein, 240mg sodium This no-cooking-required overnight muesli-oatmeal hybrid is a nutritional giant. Each pouch of oats, which you only need to dump into a jar or bowl and soak in milk for a few hours, has an impressive 20 grams of plant-based protein and 11g of dietary fiber from sources like chia seeds. There is even some probiotics in the fold to give your gut a boost. Plus, the product is low in added sugar, letting the dried fruit carry most of the sweetness. And the chocolate flavor makes it a crave-worthy breakfast. The great balance of carbs and protein makes this a good option for post-gym recovery nutrition. Oikos Pro Plain Nutrition (3/4 cup): 160 calories, 3.5g fat, 6g carbs, 0g fiber, 25g protein, 60mg sodium The inclusion of whey protein gives this yogurt even more of the macro than most Greek versions on the market. Plus, it’s deliciously thick without including any thickening agents and delivers just the right amount of tang. The plain flavor means there are no added sugars.

PA and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report scales. The WCS was calculated by subtracting self-reported average weekday sleep hours from weekend sleep hours, and serum hsCRP levels were measured using immunoturbidimetric methods. Given that depressive symptoms are characterized by their multifaceted nature, we identified specific symptoms associated with hsCRP levels. Path analysis was used to investigate the association between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and depressive symptoms, and that between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and specific symptoms related to hsCRP.\n\nRESULTS: Higher levels of PA and WCS were associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms through lowering hsCRP levels. Among various depressive symptoms, sleep problems and appetite changes were associated with hsCRP. In pathway analyses using them as dependent variables, higher levels of PA and WCS were also associated with a decreased risk of sleep problems and appetite changes through lowering hsCRP levels.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The current study employed a cross-sectional design, and WCS and PA were based on participants' self-reports rather than objective measurements.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of PA and WCS may help alleviate depressive symptoms, particularly sleep problems and appetite changes, by mitigating chronic inflammation.

Vascular and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are thought to contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes, a key vascular cell type, may play a key role. In model organisms, sleep disruption is associated with pericyte dysfunction and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Recent advances in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) technology have identified two transcriptionally distinct subtypes of pericytes: extracellular matrix protein-expressing M-pericytes and solute carrier-expressing T-pericytes. However, the relationship between sleep, pericyte biology and cognition in humans remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that differences in the composition of brain pericyte subpopulations, as inferred from marker gene expression, may link sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline. We leveraged two published human brain snRNAseq datasets to identify specific marker genes for M- and T-type pericytes. We then used post-mortem bulk RNAseq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 1092) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (n = 495) to quantify expression of these marker genes in older adults in two longitudinal cohort studies: the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. We derived trajectories of global cognitive function from participants' ante-mortem annual cognitive assessments, while sleep fragmentation was derived from ante-mortem wrist-actigraphy recordings from a subset of 572 participants. We used multivariate linear regression to relate pericyte marker gene expression to sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline in the decade preceding death. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, greater average sleep fragmentation was associated with greater expression of M-pericyte marker genes [estimate = +3.65 × 10-1, standard error (SE) = 1.61 × 10-1, P = 0.024] but not T-pericyte marker genes. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression of M-pericyte (estimate = -8.30 × 10-3, SE = 3.37 × 10-3, P = 0.014) but not T-pericyte marker genes was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in the 10 years prior to death. In the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, greater sleep fragmentation was also associated with greater composite M-pericyte gene expression (estimate = + 4.48 × 10-1, SE = 1.92 × 10-1, P = 0.02), which in turn was associated with faster cognitive decline in the decade preceding death (estimate = -1.30 × 10-2, SE = 4.55 × 10-3, P = 0.0044). These findings identify a potential role of M-pericytes in linking sleep fragmentation and cognitive trajectories in older adults. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of vascular mechanisms in linking disrupted sleep to dementia.", "relevance_score": 7.0554, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "sleep"]}

Through large-scale training on protein primary sequences, PLMs generate vector representations that encapsulate the biochemical and structural properties of proteins. At the core of PLMs is the attention mechanism, which facilitates the capture of long-range dependencies by computing pairwise importance scores across residues, thereby highlighting regions of biological interaction within the sequence. The attention matrices offer an untapped opportunity to uncover specific biological properties of proteins, particularly their functions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, using the Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM), for identifying High Attention (HA) sites within protein primary sequences, corresponding to key residues that define protein families. By examining attention patterns across multiple layers, we pinpoint residues that contribute most to family classification and function prediction. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a method for identifying HA sites at critical residues from the middle layers of the PLM; (2) we demonstrate that these HA sites provide interpretable links to biological functions; and (3) we show that HA sites improve active site predictions for functions of unannotated proteins. We make available the HA sites for the human proteome.

Developing of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays is crucial for effective HVL control in Brazil, enabling early disease detection and improving treatment outcomes. To enhance diagnostic capabilities, we evaluated the performance of a chimeric protein designed from B-lymphocyte cell epitopes identified through immunoproteomic analysis in serological tests for detecting L. infantum infection.

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. After 45, muscle mass naturally starts to decline at a faster rate, a process known as sarcopenia. The result isn’t just less strength in the gym. It can lead to weaker joints, slower recovery, and everyday tasks, such as climbing stairs or carrying groceries, becoming more challenging than they should be. The good news is that targeted strength training is one of the most effective ways to fight this loss, and the earlier you make it part of your routine, the longer you hold on to muscle and vitality. The key is choosing movements that work with your body, not against it. That means simple routines that challenge your muscles through full ranges of motion, reinforce balance and posture, and replicate the way you actually move in daily life. You don’t need hours in the gym or advanced equipment. What you need are consistent, smartly designed routines that focus on strength, power, and stability. The following six routines are built to cover all bases. Each one highlights a different piece of the muscle-maintenance puzzle—upper body, lower body, core, power, carrying strength, and total-body mobility. Practice these consistently, and you’ll not only fight muscle loss but build a foundation of strength that carries into every area of life. This workout balances pressing and pulling strength, which is critical after 45. Many adults develop rounded shoulders and weak upper backs from sitting and working at a desk. Training both push-ups and rows ensures strong chest and shoulders while reinforcing posture, balance, and joint stability. What you need: Suspension trainer, sturdy bar, or countertop for rows. Optional mat for push-ups. About 15 minutes. The Routine: Directions: Alternate push-ups and rows for 3–4 rounds. Rest 45–60 seconds between moves. How to Do It: Best Variations: Incline push-ups, dumbbell bench press, banded rows, one-arm dumbbell row. Form Tip: Engage your core throughout both moves to prevent sagging hips or arching back. 5 Standing Exercises To Shrink Your ‘Armpit Pooch’ For Good Lower-body strength is the foundation for balance and mobility. After 45, weakness in the legs accelerates muscle loss, fall risk, and joint issues. This workout targets the quadriceps, gluteals, and hamstrings while reinforcing everyday skills such as standing up, walking, and climbing stairs. What you need: A sturdy step, bench, or box. Optional dumbbells for extra load. About 15–20 minutes. The Routine: Directions: Perform all exercises as a circuit. Rest 60–75 seconds between rounds. How to Do It: Best Variations: Goblet squats, weighted step-ups, and Bulgarian split squats. Form Tip: Keep knees aligned over toes and avoid letting them cave inward. 5 Bodyweight Exercises That Torch Belly Fat Without Getting on the Floor After 50 Core strength is about more than abs. It’s the foundation for protecting your spine and transferring power between your upper and lower body. This workout targets the deep stabilizers to reduce back pain, improve posture, balance, and athletic performance. What you need: A Mat or soft surface. About 10–15 minutes. The Routine: Directions: Perform exercises in order, resting 30 seconds between sets. How to Do It: Best Variations: Stability ball rollouts, hollow holds, mountain climbers. Form Tip: Brace your abs as if preparing for impact. 16 Best Exercises for Women Over 50 To Live Longer Carries and lifts mimic real-life movements—picking up groceries, moving furniture, holding luggage. This routine strengthens your grip, back, and core, building resilience and independence as you age. What you need: Dumbbells, kettlebells, or any heavy household items. About 15 minutes. The Routine: Directions: Perform carries for distance, resting briefly, then move into deadlifts. Finish with a carry challenge round. How to Do It: Best Variations: Overhead carries, rack carries, trap bar deadlifts. Form Tip: Keep core tight and avoid leaning to one side on suitcase carries. 8 Standing Exercises Women Should Do Daily To Stay Fit, Firm & Toned Power fades faster than strength with age. Training explosively helps preserve fast-twitch muscle fibers, which support balance, reaction speed, and athletic movement. This workout safely develops power using bodyweight and light resistance. What you need: Medicine ball or kettlebell. About 15–20 minutes. The Routine: Directions: Perform each move explosively with full effort. Rest 90 seconds between sets to maintain quality. How to Do It: Best Variations: Box jumps, rotational throws, broad jumps. Form Tip: Focus on speed and crisp movement, not heavy weight. 5 Bodyweight Moves That Build Core Power Better Than Gym Equipment After 40 Strength and mobility must work together as you age. This workout combines multiple movement patterns into one flow, challenging stability while building muscle. It teaches your body to move as a unit instead of in isolated parts. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e What you need: A kettlebell, dumbbell, or just bodyweight. About 20 minutes. The Routine: Directions: Move smoothly through each exercise. Rest 90 seconds between sets. How to Do It: Best Variations: Dumbbell thruster, side-bend lunge, half get-up. Form Tip: Keep your eyes on the weight during the get-up for balance and safety. Muscle doesn’t fade overnight. It slips away little by little if you don’t challenge it. The good news is you don’t need complex programming to turn the tide. What matters most is consistency, structure, and a plan that balances effort with recovery. By following simple routines like the ones above, you can build a weekly training rhythm that restores strength, maintains muscle, and keeps you feeling younger than your age. Action Steps: Strength training keeps you strong, capable, and confident in every area of life. Looking for easy ways to lose fat? Here’s How Long Your Walking Workout Should Be To Shrink Belly Fat .

Your training might change, but it doesn't have to suffer.</p>\n\nHERE'S HOW I became an expert on building muscle after 40: I turned 40 (and then 50 , but that's a slightly different story ). I started paying more attention to the many dishonest ways fitness in general—and strength  training especially—is sold to men and women over 40. It starts with the generalization that everyone over 40 is in the same condition and has the same goals. At one extreme are bullshit claims that “age is just a number.” This crowd promotes powerlifting and CrossFit and obstacle course racing to people who put themselves at risk of serious injury if they jump into them without a solid base of muscular fitness. Those at the other extreme assume that everyone over 40 is a mess; that they’re either out of shape or broken down; that they aren’t interested in building muscle or increasing strength or just looking good in the mirror; that they’re so time-challenged that each half-hour workout must cover every aspect of fitness—strength, cardio, and flexibility. Let’s start with a look at what’s real and what isn’t, and how you can use smart, expert-built programs (like those available in the Men's Health Training Lab ) for your own unique body. Sarcopenia is real. You will lose muscle as you get older. But how much you lose, and when you start losing it, are very much under your control. The best defense against sarcopenia is to build as much muscle as you can, and then work everyday to retain it. The best time to start building that muscle is “long before now.\" But if “before now” isn’t an option, “now” is where we’ll start. Your connective tissues have already started to lose some of their elasticity, which means your joints will be less mobile. That’s why your exercise choices are critical. The wrong ones can damage joints, which matters because... There are no easy injuries to bounce back from or work through. The days of gritting your teeth and fighting through aches and pains are behind you. Even without injuries, your work capacity is starting to decline, along with your ability to recuperate from the work you put in. Those of us in middle age simply can’t go balls-out every time we walk into the gym and expect to recover like we could 10 or 20 years ago. It makes much more sense to train more frequently, but to inflict less damage on your muscles and joints in those workouts. The workouts we do are only as good as our ability to recover from them. No recovery, no benefit. Consistency trumps intensity. Unless you’re new to lifting, you can’t expect to see progress every single workout—to lift more weight, or lift the same weight for more reps, or grind through a higher volume of sets and reps. Think of it like your job: Much of the time, you’re just trying to get through the day without falling farther behind. Same with your workouts. As long as you show up and get some training in, that’s a win. Your journey to 40 is not mine, and mine isn’t yours. But one thing I’ve learned from training clients over 40—and I’ve now trained quite a few of them—is that we can all work from the same basic set of principles. I call it intelligent bodybuilding. I’ve been bodybuilding for the past quarter century, and I can attest that, aside from a few cartoon characters, it’s very much a thinking person’s pursuit. Bodybuilding is also the only training system you can pursue for life, with the possibility of improvements at ages when most athletes have called it quits. You won’t often find a powerlifter who started at 15 and peaked at 40 or beyond (not that you can't get strong later in life ). But you’ll find plenty of bodybuilders who meet that description. These are the fundamentals of a smart bodybuilding program: You should do at least one exercise in these categories per week: The muscles of your shoulder girdle—chest, deltoids, lats, traps—all have multiple responsibilities. Your pectoralis major, for example, does more than push something away from your chest (a movement called shoulder flexion). It also pulls your arms in toward the midline of your body (adduction), rotates your upper arms inward (internal rotation), and even pulls them to your sides (extension). Different parts of the muscle handle different movements at different angles, which means you need more than pushups and bench presses in your workout program. Everyone agrees that a great workout program should be built around compound, multi-joint exercises like squats, lunges, deadlifts, presses, and rows. They use the most muscle in movement patterns that replicate real-life activities like running, jumping, lifting, climbing, pushing, and pulling. But isolation movements like curls, press downs, flies, and lateral raises are also important. There are a few reasons why I think older lifters should do more isolation work. Unlike compound movements, they don’t consume a lot of energy, which means you can push yourself harder and recover faster. Isolation exercises are perfect for those times when you want to crush a couple of sets to failure. They allow a deep mind-muscle connection. That is, you can go inside the muscle and feel how hard it’s working—something you can’t do with a squat or bench press. Used intelligently, they shore up vulnerable joints with minimal risk of injury. Used intelligently, they shore up vulnerable joints with minimal risk of injury. I know it’s a thrill to see your one-rep max go up on a bragging-rights exercise like the bench press or deadlift. I’ve experienced it, as every lifelong meathead has. But once you’re past 40, there’s way too much risk for basically no reward at all in terms of improving your physique. Think about switching up your approach to workouts that demand no fewer than 6 reps per set. Most work can be in the range of 8 to 15 reps—and sometimes you can go as high as 25. Why? You’ll get better muscle growth in those ranges, with less risk to your joints and easier recovery. How will you know you’re making progress? A few ways: It’s fashionable these days to say that there are no bad exercises. But when you’re over 40, many exercises should simply be avoided: That said, I don’t want to be one of those Internet gurus who says every lifter must stop doing X, Y, and Z the minute he or she turns 40, as if every shoulder, hip, and spinal disc has the exact same expiration date. Take the barbell shoulder press, for example. It’s not just a good lift, it’s a great lift... but only if you can do it well. Most lifters can’t, and even some who can may find that it eventually causes more residual joint pain than it’s worth. For almost everyone reading this, it’s much better to use the dumbbell shoulder press and the other overhead lifts in their program. Now that you know what works, let's talk about mistakes you need to avoid to make the most of your training at 40 and beyond. Power, an important physical characteristic , has more real-world applications than you'd expect. But power diminishes quickly, especially after 40. Explosive training should be part of your workout, but not with Olympic lifts or box jumps (as we already covered as potential poor exercise choices). Instead, opt for moves like kettlebell swings. Want an idea of what this can look like in practice? Check out the MH Ultimate Athletic Training program . Yes, you can still touch big weights from time to time. But it's not worth making your entire routine based on lifting the heaviest load possible. As we've covered, your joints are less hardy than in years past. Yes, we touched on this briefly already—but it bears repeating: Don't skip your single-joint exercises. Think about choosing movements that complement the bigger multi-joint movements you do at the top of your workout. You might want to be strong, but for an efficient, healthy body, you need a cardiovascular component to your training. One factor you might not have considered: Along with diminished muscle, strength, and power, your metabolism will also slow down as you age. Get your heart rate elevated to burn more calories by adding even 10 minutes of continuous cardio two to three times per week. Want to learn more?

It has been confirmed that Klotho serves as a critical protective factor across multiple biological systems, with its roles in neuroprotection, cardiovascular health, and renal function being particularly noteworthy. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of Klotho protein against oxidative and nitrosative stress in heart IRI through regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway. The study utilised in vitro human cardiomyocyte culture and ex vivo isolated rat hearts subjected to IRI. Recombinant Klotho protein was administered to evaluate its effects on heart mechanical function, gene and protein expression of NOS isoforms, oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, MMP activity, and lipid metabolism. Administration of Klotho significantly improved heart mechanical and contractile function following ischemia/reperfusion. Klotho normalised the expression and synthesis of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, resulting in reduced production of reactive nitrogen species and attenuated nitrosative stress. It also limited oxidative damage, reflected by decreased protein oxidation, and restored fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, Klotho regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and activity, thereby protecting heart contractile proteins from degradation. The Klotho protein exhibits significant cardioprotection in IRI by mitigating oxidative and nitrosative stress through the modulation of the NOS/MMP signalling pathway.

There were no differences in basic indicators such as gender, age distribution and body mass index between the two groups. RA diagnosis followed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 or ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 criteria. Exclusion criteria included major organ dysfunction, endocrine disease, infection or long-term hormone or psychotropic drug use.\n\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included total skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, FMR measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.

Total fat mass was positively correlated with simplified and CDAI (p<0.001). Total skeletal muscle mass was negatively correlated with ESR (p=0.001) and positively correlated with both L1-4 and hip bone mineral density (p<0.001). FMR showed a positive correlation with clinical disease activity index (p<0.001). There were significant differences in total fat mass and FMR among RA patients with varying disease activity levels (p<0.001). RA patients with concomitant OP or using glucocorticoids had a higher total fat mass and FMR than their respective control groups, with only total skeletal muscle mass levels being lower (p<0.01). We developed predictive models using multiple machine learning algorithms, which identified that both age and FMR were key factors associated with secondary OP in RA patients. Subgroup analysis identified an interaction effect between FMR and gender and restricted cubic spline fitted the dose-response relationship between FMR and OP.\n\nCONCLUSION: FMR may serve as a useful clinical indicator of secondary OP in RA patients.

Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Intense training sessions drain the body’s carbohydrate reserves, which muscles depend on for performance. If those stores stay low, it can slow recovery and reduce the ability to grow muscle. ( 1 ) Pairing carbs with quality protein restores glycogen and spares muscle tissue from further breakdown. Carbs are massively anti-catabolic. They prevent muscle loss to a huge extent. Dr. Israetel believes that consuming a post-workout sooner rather than later helps to halt muscle breakdown, setting the stage for better recovery. ( 5 ) A post shared by Casey Kelly (@caseykellyfit) “Relatively low-fat, high-carb, high-quality protein within 30 minutes of your workout…no more check marks left,” Dr. Israetel explained. Even strength athletes and strongmen in a calorie surplus follow the same strategy: Aim for clean, nutrient-dense foods, then fill the gaps with higher-calorie options to meet energy demands. You have a total calorie budget to hit. Establish a core of healthy foods that give you the most benefits. Balancing high protein and carbs with low fat is Dr. Israetel’s recipe for rapid recovery and muscle growth.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of evidence regarding the safety, efficacy, and impact factors of applying the resorbable bio-inductive collagen implant clinically to repair rotator cuff injuries.\n\nMETHODS: The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022367522). A systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to October 2024) for clinical studies on bio-inductive collagen implants for rotator cuff repair. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality (using RoB1 for RCTs, NOS for cohort studies and JBI critical appraisal tools for case series). Primary outcomes included postoperative tendon thickness, shoulder function scores (ASES/Constant), and re-tear rates. Data were analyzed using random/fixed-effects models to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs, with subgroup analyses for tear type, patient age, and postoperative mobilization time. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 17.0.\n\nRESULTS: Seventeen studies were included.

In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis identified heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β) as a potential downstream effector of TMAO. In both HepG2 cells and HFD-fed mice, TMAO upregulated HSP90β expression, perturbing protein homeostasis. FMO3 Sh reduced HSP90β protein activity and mRNA levels. Meanwhile, proteomic analysis revealed that the TMAO/HSP90β axis disrupts mitochondrial protein homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by MPTP opening, MMP decrease, and ROS production. In vivo, activation of the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by swollen mitochondria with reduced cristae observed via TEM. Notably, FMO3 Sh ameliorated mitochondrial function by suppressing the TMAO/HSP90β axis.

The use of osteobiologics to enhance fusion has emerged as a promising alternative to address the limitations of autologous iliac crest bone graft (AICBG), but their comparative efficacy and safety remain unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the fusion rates, safety profiles, and clinical outcomes of the use of osteobiologics in LSF.\n\nMETHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different osteobiologics to AICBG in LSF. Data on fusion rates, complications, pain, disability, blood loss, operative time, and length of stay (LOS) were extracted. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework. The NMA was performed using a frequentist random-effects model to compare the efficacy and safety of various osteobiologics, along with associated perioperative and clinical outcomes.\n\nRESULTS: Forty-three RCTs including a total of 3,823 patients were identified. The use of rhBMP-2 (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2) significantly improved fusion rates (odds ratio [OR]: 3.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.59 to 5.32; p < 0.0001) and reduced complications (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.68; p < 0.0001) compared with AICBG, with moderate certainty of the evidence. Other osteobiologics, including ABM/P-15 (anorganic bone matrix/15-amino acid peptide fragment) and allograft, demonstrated reduced complication rates, although the quality of the evidence was low to very low. No significant differences were observed for pain, disability, or LOS. The use of rhBMP-2, autologous local bone, and silicate-substituted calcium phosphate was associated with decreased operative time, with rhBMP-2 additionally associated with lower intraoperative blood loss.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of rhBMP-2 was associated with significantly higher fusion and lower complication rates compared with AICBG, as well as decreased operative time and blood loss.

Some lifters treat it as a free pass to load up on burgers, fries, and milkshakes in the name of “getting big.” Sure, the scale moves up fast, but so does your body fat, leaving you sluggish in the gym and staring at an extended, painful cut when it’s time to lean down. The reality is, bulking doesn’t have to be an all-you-can-eat buffet. A well-run bulking cycle is calculated, structured, and purposeful. I’m talking about adding slabs of quality muscle while keeping fat gain under control, so that when you transition out, you’re bigger, stronger, and still relatively lean.  Think of it like tuning a race car. You can’t just dump in cheap fuel and expect world-class performance. With the right balance of nutrition, training, and recovery, you can build size that lasts, strength that translates, and a physique you’ll be proud of at the end of the cycle. I’ve seen this firsthand both in the weight room and on the performance field. As a coach with a Master’s in Sports Performance, NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS), National Sports Performance Association Certified Sports Nutrition Coach, and USAW National Coach, I’ve helped athletes and lifters of all levels bulk the right way. Whether it’s preparing an Olympic weightlifter for competition or guiding everyday athletes in the gym, the same principles hold: smart bulking builds muscle without the baggage. In the sections ahead, we’ll lay out the blueprint for bulking smarter: dialing in your calories without overdoing it, training for muscle instead of just numbers, and building the daily habits that separate the jacked from the bloated. Make this list your go-to menu to gain muscle without fat. Calories drive growth, but the quality and quantity of those calories determine if you’re building lean muscle or just adding belly fat. As a certified nutrition coach, I’ve seen lifters make the same mistake over and over again, thinking bulking means eating without limits. That might move the scale, but most of that weight comes from fat. A better approach is starting with a moderate surplus of 250–500 calories above maintenance. This keeps your body in growth mode without forcing you to diet for months on end afterward. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Find Your Surplus Sweet Spot: Track weekly weight gain. A reasonable rate is 0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week. Faster than that, and your body is likely storing fat instead of building muscle. Coach’s Note: Eating like it’s Thanksgiving every night isn’t bulking—it’s bingeing. Smart bulking involves consuming clean foods in slightly larger quantities and adjusting your intake as your body responds. Training during a bulk is about creating the right stimulus for hypertrophy while maintaining optimal recovery. The goal is to convert extra calories into high-quality muscle with consistent, structured training. As a strength coach, I program bulking cycles differently from strength or peaking cycles. The priority is progressive overload in the hypertrophy range. This means pushing for steady increases in weight, reps, or sets each week to build muscle mass rather than test maximum strength. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Coach’s Note: During a bulk, volume and quality are the focus. Push for consistent progress in your training and avoid sloppy lifting that can stall your results. Training and nutrition are the foundation of a bulk, but lifestyle choices decide how well your body responds. Recovery, sleep, hydration, and stress management are often the difference between gaining lean muscle and spinning your wheels. Here’s what I emphasize with athletes: Coach’s Note: Lifestyle is the glue that holds training and nutrition together. Dial in these habits, and your bulking cycle will run smoother with far better results. Not all bulks are created equal. A smart bulk builds lean mass with minimal fat gain, while a dirty bulk leaves you sluggish and forces you into a long, painful cut. Here’s the difference I highlight with lifters: Coach’s Note: A lean 10 pounds gained from a smart bulk will outperform a sloppy 20 every time. Muscle built with intention lasts, while fat only adds more work later. Bulking should never be an excuse to get sloppy. With the right balance of nutrition, structured training, and supportive lifestyle habits, you can add lean muscle that looks good and performs even better. The key is precision—eating enough to grow, training with intent, and recovering so your body can utilize the extra calories effectively. A smart bulk builds strength, confidence, and muscle mass that you’ll retain even after the cycle ends. A dirty bulk only sets you up for extra fat loss later. The difference comes down to discipline and consistency in the details. The bodybuilder is readying for the pro stage with his own brand of \"science.\" If the majority of your answers are “yes,” you’re bulking smart. If not, it’s time to tighten up your approach before small mistakes become significant setbacks. Coach’s Note: When you step into a bulking cycle, think precision, not permission. Fuel your training, recover properly, and build size you’ll be proud of when it’s time to show the results.

Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness.

We provide an overview of selected applications and concepts that have had a significant impact on life science research, and some that have also led to significant commercial implications. In the 1980s, the SpA promoter and signal sequence were utilized in Escherichia coli for recombinant production of various proteins, yielding product secretion to the culture medium and thereby simplifying product recovery. The five homologous Ig-binding domains of SpA gained tremendous interest in the late 1980s, largely due to the rise of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use, prompting a growing demand for effective affinity ligands to facilitate their purification. Over the years, these Ig-binding domains have been extensively investigated and re-engineered to bind proteins other than antibodies, leading in the mid-1990s to the development of the affibody affinity protein technology. Today, affibody molecules are being investigated in late-stage clinical trials as potential protein therapeutics for various indications. Finally, the cell wall anchoring regions of SpA inspired the development of a surface display system for Staphylococcus carnosus, which has emerged as a technology platform in combinatorial protein engineering for work with large peptide, antibody and affibody libraries.", "relevance_score": 5.0901, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "recovery"]}

Dysregulation in any phase impairs healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and amino acids are essential in promoting tissue repair. This study evaluated a topical medical device containing HA and amino acids for its safety and efficacy in treating hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds.\n\nMETHOD: This four-week, one-arm, two-centre pilot clinical study included patients with hard-to-heal wounds of various aetiologies. Wounds were classified by exudate level and amount of necrosis. Treatment with different vehicles (cream, gel or powder) was tailored based on wound characteristics. Wound size was measured at baseline and final visit, while symptom severity was tracked using the total symptom score (TSS). Investigator assessment and safety monitoring were also conducted.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the study. Wound size reduced significantly across all groups, with an average reduction of 54%, and 41% of patients achieving complete healing. Symptom severity, as measured by TSS, showed a consistent and significant reduction. Clinical improvement was observed in 95% of patients and no serious adverse events were reported. The product demonstrated good safety and tolerability.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, the HA and amino acids product effectively reduced ulcer size, improved symptoms and promoted healing, demonstrating its efficacy in hard-to-heal wound management. The findings are clinically significant but limited by the absence of a control group and a short observation period. Further randomised controlled trials are required to confirm these results and explore broader clinical applications.", "relevance_score": 5.0161, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "safety"]}

However, the composition and levels of these chemicals are derived from complex metabolic systems and are easily influenced by biological activities, which has hindered judicial institutions worldwide from establishing standardized analytical procedures. To develop a rapid, accurate, and straightforward analytical method, this study employed UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS to quantify amino acid levels in fingermark residues, integrating machine learning techniques and intelligent optimization algorithms for gender prediction. We evaluated whether the relative concentrations of amino acids in fingermark residues-normalized to endogenous serine-could reliably serve as indicators for gender determination, while also examining the effects of donors' physical activity levels, living regions, and fingermark aging periods (0-64 days) on gender classification. The results indicate that significant differences in gender were observed. Under various physical activity frequencies, leucine and valine consistently exhibited statistically significant differences, while across different living regions, valine and phenylalanine remained significant. Moreover, a comprehensive Mann-Whitney significance analysis, followed by Bonferroni correction on all measured fingermarks, revealed that the concentrations of Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, Pro, Asn, Glu, His, and Asp differ significantly between genders. Four classification models were developed based on the relative abundances of amino acids in fingermark residues, and their hyperparameters were optimized using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Ultimately, the PSO-BP model achieved the highest accuracy of 84.49%. In summary, this study introduces a novel approach utilizing the relative concentrations of amino acids in fingermarks for gender determination. The established method is simple, accurate, and does not require derivatization, making it less susceptible to transfer loss, aging time, or individual factors. The developed models exhibit high classification accuracy and robust generalization ability. The conclusions from this study may provide valuable references for the development of sensitive amino acid reagents and also address a gap in the stability discussion of fingermark residue research.", "relevance_score": 4.755, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "leucine"]}

Their presence has been detected in human tissues, including blood and placental tissue, raising concerns about developmental effects. However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation.

The telomerase enzyme, on the other hand, is generally not active in skin cells due to constrained regulation. Research has demonstrated that anti-ageing drugs under development can activate the telomerase enzyme. The study used a computer-based method to examine how well patchouli plant parts could work as telomerase enzyme activators in cells' metabolic pathways. This research uses an in silico approach with three primary methods: network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. According to the network pharmacology study, the compounds found in the patchouli plant parts can turn on the telomerase enzyme through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Compounds in the patchouli plant activate the AKT1, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 proteins. These proteins are part of the telomerase enzyme activation pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics analyses show that patchouli plant compounds bind well to each protein, implying that the patchouli plant can activate telomerase. Both in vitro and in vivo tests are required to verify these findings.", "relevance_score": 4.1019, "relevance_hits": ["plant", "protein"]}

This review showcases the molecular biological mechanisms of drug synergism vs antagonism mediated by transcription factors, signal pathway regulation, and membrane transport proteins, and subsequently delves into the molecular structural basis of protein-drug interactions, including precise identification methods for drug binding sites, optimization strategies for molecular docking techniques, and the mechanisms and structural characteristics of multi-target drugs. The review systematically evaluates the practical application progress of AI technologies, especially machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in predicting drug synergy-antagonism effects, as well as the methodological approaches for constructing and evaluating the performance of AI prediction models that integrate multi-source biological data. These research findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for the precision treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and metabolic disorders, with significant clinical and translational implications for advancing personalized medicine strategies in clinical practice and facilitating the rational design and development of novel multi-target drugs.", "relevance_score": 4.0888, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

However, most studies have focused on low protein diets to stimulate autophagy and reduce ageing-related factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological, metabolic and molecular effects of a 7-day plant-based FMD with low protein/high fat (LP) and high protein/low fat content (HP) in healthy humans and compare those responses to a non-intervention comparator control group.\n\nMETHODS: Forty six healthy men and women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CONTROL (isoenergetic diet), n = 16 (mean ± SD age 35.0 ± 9.5 yrs, BMI 23.3 ± 2.7 kg\n\nRESULTS: Both FMDs reduced body weight and fat mass (interaction effects P < 0.0001) but only HP-FMD reduced visceral fat mass relative to CONTROL [mean difference (95 % CI): -0.09 (-0.15 to -0.03) kg, P = 0.006]. Both FMDs reduced fasting plasma glucose by ∼10 % [LP-FMD: -0.41 (-0.80 to -0.02) mmol\n\nCONCLUSION: Both FMDs promoted cardiometabolic health and induction of autophagy, with HP-FMD selectively conferring novel benefits in body composition, circulating lipid profiles, heart rate variability and gut microbiome health. These findings suggest that FMDs with varied macronutrient compositions could be customised to better align with individual health goals and preferences.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT06560996.

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!", "relevance_score": 4.0, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

From the introductory paragraph:\n\n>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume “1.6-2.2g/kg” [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don’t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you’ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume – it certainly won’t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn’t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.\n\nThis article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition.", "relevance_score": 4.0, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

All of my scans have been perfect, and I am effectively cancer free according to my doctors. Thank goodness! In spite of that, I am still having a tough time putting weight on like I used to, and I still have other symptoms (like night sweating) which are commonly associated with cancer. Because of all that, I decided that it was finally time to get my ass back in the gym. The way I see it is, if I can actually build some mass and keep it on, then I have little reason to be concerned about my health at this point (considering the good scans and the word of my doctors.)  \n  \n**Part of that process for me has always been consuming whey protein powder.** I was struggling to hit the recommended macros for my weight, even before getting cancer, and that is especially the case now. In the past, I would default to Nutricost's Choc/PB Whey Isolate, which I would drink with milk or blend it into a smoothie after my workout. At the time, I was very satisfied with their product and this routine. Since getting cancer, however, I have become concerned over the fact that a lot of these commercial protein powders contain lead and other heavy metals, as well as BPA, etc... and started looking into possible alternatives to Nutricost. So far, I have had a very hard time finding anything that is up to my standards. I even looked into organic beef protein as a potentially viable alternative to whey protein, only to discover that the most \"organic-seeming\" brand I could find contained 5x the level of arsenic as a can of sardines. I've looked into other types of protein too, and I just keep getting crap.\n\nAs somebody who is just getting over cancer, I am really not trying to poison myself with this sort of thing any longer; I *want* to make healthy lifestyle changes. I've been doing a ton of research over these past two weeks, but I keep coming up short. A lot of places don't display their heavy metals testing-- or, if they do, the tests are rarely ever dated. I've personally called around and emailed many of these companies directly, but they won't send me their tests. I am hearing many versions of \"Yeah, we're compliant, I promise... No we won't send you the tests, those are proprietary,\" and I can't tell you how absolutely frustrating this is as a diligent consumer.  \n  \nCan anybody please recommend me a few brands to look into, that meet my criteria? I want an organic, daily-use protein powder that is free of BS. No heavy metals, BPA, and other carcinogenic crap...

The jalapeño is optional, but it does contain beneficial capsaicin, which is linked to increased metabolism of fats and reduction in insulin spikes ( 1 , 2 ). Remove the seeds of the jalapeño if you prefer a milder flavor. The type of tortilla you use is important here.

There are plenty of  times when digging into your favorite brownie is 100 percent worth it, whether it’s your birthday, the annual holiday party, or you’re really craving it. But when you want something fudgy and sweet on a random Tuesday at 8 p.m., you might want a healthier way to satisfy it. And for that, we bring you this healthy single-serve brownie recipe. MyFitnessPal partnered with well-known foodie and content creator Michelle Chen of @run2food to develop this delicious vegan and gluten-free dessert. If you don’t follow a vegan diet, you can easily swap out the alternative milk and vegan protein powder to match your dietary preferences. “This fudge brownie is seriously SO YUM guys!” Michelle posted on Instagram , calling it the “best” one she’s ever made. High in protein, it’s an easy way to stay on track with your health and wellness goals while still getting your chocolate fix. Even better? It only takes 90 seconds to whip up. Here’s why this 6-ingredient brownie is a more nutritious sweet treat, and how to make it yourself. Michelle’s single-serve brownie recipe is macro-friendly, packed with 26 grams of protein (to compare, a 3-ounce serving of chicken breast has 24 grams). But why is that so important—and why are so many recipes for protein desserts popping up lately? To start, protein is a necessary macronutrient . And no, it isn’t just for bodybuilders and serious athletes. We all need protein for proper development and basic bodily functions, including strengthening bones, building muscle, and maintaining healthy tissues and organs . In this particular single-serve brownie recipe, Michelle uses a vegan chocolate protein powder from Australian supplement brand Macro Mike as her protein source. You can use any preferred chocolate protein powder for the recipe. If you want to track your protein intake to monitor how much you’re eating every day (and make sure you’re getting enough for your needs), you can use the MyFitnessPal app. In her sponsored post, Michelle calls it her “go-to app for calculating macros of my recipes and also ensuring that I eat enough protein in my vegan diet.” A post shared by Michelle Chen (@run2food)  Michelle swaps out white sugar and uses more natural sweeteners, including banana and maple syrup. Bananas are a great source of potassium and other vitamins. And maple syrup has more minerals and antioxidants than refined sugar. She also uses almond milk as a vegan and plant-based alternative to dairy milk. Almond milk is lower in calories than regular milk .

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? WE NEED PROTEIN to build muscle , but it’s hard to shove a rotisserie chicken or steak in your gym bag to help you meet your macros. That’s where protein bars can come into play. These handy products provide fuel on the go, with a careful balance of nutrients to ensure you can stay on track with your health goals. It’s important to point out these bars shouldn’t be in your main source of daily protein —and a lot of them don't really match the grams of protein in a protein powder shake. Instead, they’re more of a solid snack or road food when nothing else is available. “They're great if you are needing something convenient to meet meal nutrition goals when you do not otherwise have time to eat food , or it is impractical to eat food,” says Joey Gochnour, RDN, NASM-CPT, a board-certified specialist in sports dietetics at Nutrition and Fitness Professional . Protein bars can also help tide you over when quick food is your only option. Unfortunately, the market is flooded with options, making it hard to know which are the best protein bars out there. “Not all protein bars are created equal, and many on the market are closer to candy bars with added protein,” says Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy . He recommends focusing on the protein content in the bar you’re considering, along with the source of this macronutrient. Also, be on the lookout for high amounts of sugar, which Keatley points out can lead to energy crashes and unnecessary calories. With that in mind, we tapped dietitians who focus on performance to weigh in on their go-to protein bars, and chomped our way through each to see how they actually taste. Learn more about why we love the bars below, and keep scrolling for specific advice from our experts about what to look for in these packaged goods. The right protein bar is one that meets your nutritional needs, as well as satisfies your tastebuds—because there's nothing satisfying about biting into cardboard. Keatley recommends considering why you want to have a protein bar in the first place, including whether you're using this for muscle recovery , a meal replacement , or a quick snack before training. (More on how to choose a bar based on those factors in a moment.)  But most protein bars should have some universal things in common, which is why it's important to pore over the ingredients list. “The ingredient list is where I like looking first,” says Angie Asche, MS, RD, CSSD, owner of Eleat Sports Nutrition . Here's what you should be looking for. Protein can come in a range of forms, but some are considered better than others. \"Look for quality sources of protein such as lean animal protein sources, whey protein isolate, eggs/egg whites, or plant-based sources such as pea protein or brown rice protein, often found as a blend,\" Asche says. The exact amount of protein to strive for in a protein bar varies based on your goals and what else you're eating throughout the day. But Asche recommends looking for a bar with at least 10 grams of protein. For muscle recovery, Keatley suggests aiming for 20 to 30 grams of protein to promote muscle repair. If you're craving a quick snack, he recommends looking for 10 to 15 grams of protein, along with 5 to 10 grams of fiber to keep you feeling satisfied. And if you want a meal replacement, Keatley suggests having a \"well-balanced mix\" of 20 to 30 grams of protein, 10 to 20 grams of fat, and at least 5 grams of fiber. The perfect macronutrient balance depends on what you're using your bar for. \"If you’re eating it around training, pre- or post-, you’ll want to find one that also contains some carbohydrates, around 30 grams,\" Asche says. Fiber is also crucial, since it supports digestion and helps you to stay fuller, longer, Keatley points out. \"Look for at least 3 to 5 grams of fiber, preferably from natural sources like nuts or chicory root,\" he says. \"Healthy fats from sources like almonds, cashews, or MCT oil are preferable to hydrogenated oils, which can contribute to inflammation.\" While you're at it, Gochnour recommends keeping tabs on the saturated fat content. \"Keep the saturated fat to total fat ratio low,\" he says. Protein bars can be sneaky sources of added sugar, heaping on extra calories you don't need and promoting unstable blood sugar levels that can cause you to crash later in the day. \"Some bars pack in 15 or more grams of added sugar,\" Keatley points out. If your bar is on the higher end of added sugar content, you'll want to make sure that it has the fat to temper it and to keep your blood sugar levels more stable. As with most foods, you really don't want these in your bars. \"The fewer artificial additives and fillers, the better,\" Keatley says. \"A short, recognizable ingredient list is a good sign that the bar is made from whole food sources rather than overly processed ingredients.\" Myself and Men's Health Fitness and Commerce Editor Charles Thorp, NASM , have used protein bars for years to fuel up at work or before workouts, so we have a foundational knowledge and experience with them. To add to our expertise, we consulted with three performance-focused dietitians: Angie Asche, MS, RD, CSSD, owner of Eleat Sports Nutrition ; Scott Keatley, RD, co-owner of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy ; and Joey Gochnour, RDN, NASM-CPT, a board-certified specialist in sports dietetics at Nutrition and Fitness Professional . Each provided advice on what to look for in these bars, along with information on their favorites. We then put the bars to the test, eating our way through each to make sure they met our high standards for taste and texture. When evaluating each bar, we considered factors like protein content and source, macronutrient balance, and added sugar. We also looked at reviews to see how others liked these nutritional tools, and factored in price to make sure you're getting value with your bar. These are the best protein bars to meet a range of needs, whether for a post-workout snack or meal replacement. Artificial sweeteners and sugar alcohols can be a double-edged sword: While they allow you to tamp down on added sugar content, they don't sit well with everyone's digestive system. If you prefer to bypass these, consider Transparent Labs' Grass-Fed Protein+ Bars. Keatley calls these a \"premium choice,\" pointing out their 16-gram protein content and quality ingredients. The bars feature a short ingredients list, including peanut butter, dates, whey protein, and coconut oil. They also have just 5 grams of added sugar for a sweet flavor that's not overwhelming. The bars come in several dessert-inspired flavors and have a good, slightly chewy texture. The only major drawback is the price: At $3.33 per bar, these are the most expensive options on our list. Read More: Best Protein Powders, Tested by Us The NOVOS Bar is the first bar developed with the idea of longevity in mind, promising to provide a more complete profile of nutrition rather than a short-term energy boost for workouts. In order to chase this goal, they’ve stocked their Longevity Bars with more than 20 superfoods, 21 essential vitamins and minerals, and clinically relevant doses of additional nutrients believed to increase your life expectancy like taurine and astaxanthin, as well as functional mushrooms. Once out of the wrapper, the bars don’t look like anything special, no matter what flavor you’ve gone with. In fact, they look pretty dull, but to be honest, I don’t need my protein bar to appear appetizing; I just need it to get the job done. There are no artificial sweeteners, and the sugar content is kept low using honey, stevia, and sweet potato. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and feel of the bar, the flavors are pretty subtle, yet enjoyable, and it breaks apart easily in your mouth. I liked that I didn’t feel particularly heavy after eating one of these bars, a side effect that some other products can have. I also appreciate that it sources its protein from a blend of pea and brown rice, which helps maintain low methionine levels, aligning with the recommendations of longevity research. All in all, I have been impressed by the bar’s ability to give me a protein boost and fill me up, now here’s hoping I snag a few more years as well. IQBars are a favorite of Men's Health Fitness and Commerce Editor Charles Thorp, who appreciates the subtle salty-sweet flavor of the brand's Chocolate Sea Salt variety. These bars pack 12 grams of protein into a relatively small container, with 8 grams of fiber to support blood sugar balance. IQBars are sweetened with stevia plant extract and have no added sugar. Combine that with the 2 grams of net carbs, and these are a solid choice for fans of keto or other low-carb diets. IQBar also touts its \"brain nutrients,\" which include magnesium, lion's mane, MCTs, and flavonoids to support brain function. Whether these bars will make you more intelligent is debatable, but they're definitely a smart choice for an on-the-go snack. The only downside of IQBars is that they're on the smaller side. But when you factor in the delicious taste, clean ingredients, and health-supporting nutrients, they're worth adding to your cart. A lot of protein bars have nuts, making this a tricky category for people with food allergies to navigate. 88 Acres' bars are nut-free and vegan, relying on pumpkin seeds to deliver the protein. \"88 Acres is a good option for those with nut allergies, especially since so many protein bars do contain nuts and nut butters,\" Asche says. These bars have a nice, chewy texture and come in a range of flavors, from banana bread to several chocolate varieties. They also have short ingredients lists and are low in added sugar. The only major downside of these bars is the cost. At $3.20 per bar, 88 Acres is the second-most expensive option on our list. Still, if you want a nutritious bar without the nuts, it's a solid choice. While some protein bars make you work to figure out what's in them, RxBar clearly states the ingredients, including the amounts, on the front of all of its packaging.  The brand's popular Dark Chocolate Peanut Butter contains 3 tablespoons of oats, 14 peanuts, two egg whites, and 2 tablespoons of honey, a fact that the company makes more than clear. \"RxBars are a solid option for those who prefer whole food ingredients, as they use egg whites for protein and have no artificial additives,\" Keatley says. The whole food ingredients also help break up that classic (and sometimes unpalatable) protein bar texture. These bars don't have the highest protein count you'll find, but they get the job done—especially if you're just looking for a snack. They're also incredibly popular, which can make it hard to find certain flavors. So, stock up when you come across one you like. Carbs and protein are important after workouts to replenish glycogen stores and support muscle repair. One's Peanut Butter Cup protein bar offers both. \"One bars offer 20 grams of protein with only one gram of sugar, making them a great post-workout option,\" says Keatley. This bar also has 25 grams of carbs to get those glycogen stores back up. The texture isn't bad—it's soft, with nuts inside to break things up—and One does a nice job of making you feel like you're having a treat without the added sugar. One has a huge range of flavors, although the fruity options can taste a little more artificial than the others. For a quick refueling after a workout, though, this hits the spot. Texture can be a tricky thing to get right with protein bars, and plenty of brands miss the mark. Barbells isn't one of them. The company's Creamy Crisp protein bars contain crunchy puffs and chocolate for a texture that feels like you're diving into a favorite candy bar. But these bars have no added sugar, making it even easier to love them. Keatley also praises the bars' \"good protein-to-calorie ratio\" (20 grams of protein to 200 calories), along with its delicious dessert-like flavors. These bars are also GMO-free and come in a generous size, making them a good option when you want to snack on something a little more hearty. Barebells uses sugar alcohols as a sweetener, so be aware that this may not be the best choice if you have a sensitive stomach. But between the large size and solid protein count, this bar is a great one to put in regular rotation. Many protein bars can help tide you over between meals or provide a quick refueling. But for those times when it'll be a while until you can squeeze in a real meal, the MET-Rx Big 100 Colossal Protein Super Cookie Crunch is worth considering. \"MET-Rx Big 100 bars deliver higher calorie content and around 30 grams of protein per bar, making them a good meal replacement option,\" Keatley says. He also points out that these are good for muscle building, given their 32 grams of protein per bar. MET-Rx's bar has a nice texture that's not overly dense, and the flavor is something you'll crave in the future. Be aware that the added sugar content is high at 24 grams, but it's tempered by 14 grams of fat and some fiber.

After graduating from culinary school in 2005, David Nayfeld was doing them six days a week. He hustled at the fine-dining mecca Eleven Madison Park in NYC, then eventually, in 2016, at his own Italian spot, Che Fico , in San Francisco, where he’s still executive chef. The hours, the travel, the parties. “One day, you’re 40 pounds overweight,” Nayfeld says. COVID gave him a chance to recommit to fitness. While he was into jiu-jitsu before the pandemic, a workout “pod” of friends helped him mix in heavy lifting , HIIT , and running . And he dialed in his diet, opting for high-protein meals that include a vegetable. Those 40 pounds now gone, Nayfeld is ready for his next goal: “I think 2026 is the year that I’m going to compete again in jiu-jitsu.” This recipe, adapted from Nayfeld’s new cookbook, Dad, What’s for Dinner ? , is easy to double for meal prep. Kewpie mayonnaise white miso Dijon mustard honey Juice of ½ lemon chicken leg quarters (drumstick and thigh, attached) small head savoy cabbage, very thinly sliced Furikake or toasted sesame seeds, to finish 1. In a bowl, mix the mayo, miso, mustard, honey, 1 tsp kosher salt, and lemon juice. Measure out ¼ cup of the mixture for the marinade and refrigerate the rest for the dressing. 2. Coat the chicken in the marinade and refrigerate, covered, at least 30 minutes and up to overnight. 3. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a wire rack over the lined tray. Arrange the chicken on the rack and roast until a meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each chicken piece registers 165°F, 30 to 45 minutes. 4. In a medium bowl, add the cabbage and toss with some of the reserved dressing, to taste. Top with the furikake or toasted sesame seeds. 5. Remove the chicken from the oven and let rest for 5 minutes. Drizzle the remaining dressing over the baked chicken. Serve with the cabbage. Nutrition per serving: 691 calories, 64g protein, 12g carbs (2g fiber), 41g fat Food styling by Rebecca Jurkevich.

This is conceptually different from muscle weakness or muscle fatigability. Fatigue is one of the most reported symptoms in MG and has been hypothesized to be an innate mechanism to minimize muscle activity in order to protect muscles from (further) damage. The exact pathophysiology of fatigue remains unclear, and it is very likely a multifactorial phenomenon. The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding on the pathophysiology of fatigue in MG.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 38 serum biomarkers including various cytokines and myokines in a cohort of 116 anti-acetylcholine receptor-positive patients with MG. A multivariate linear regression analysis for each biomarker was performed in search for a correlation with fatigue. The following preselected covariates were included in the primary analysis: sex, age, disease severity, depression and anxiety scores, nonsteroid immune suppressive medication, and cumulative prednisone dosage in the past 6 months.\n\nRESULTS: Severe fatigue was present in 64% of patients. Results show a robust correlation between fatigue and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the primary analysis. This correlation persisted when additionally adjusting for BMI, strenuous physical activities, and hemoglobulin levels.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that chronic low-grade inflammation, mediated by CRP, contributes to the pathogenesis of fatigue in MG. This aligns with the hypothesis that local peripheral inflammatory processes induce systemic inflammatory cascades responsible for fatigue.", "relevance_score": 3.9289, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein"]}

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSA and AF comorbidity were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).

Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models.

A novel approach based on molecular imprinting technology was developed to detect biomarkers associated with wound inflammation, using biopolymeric materials. In this study, an electrochemical biosensor for the selective detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) was developed by modifying gold screen-printed electrodes (Au-SPE) with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The high-performance sensor film was prepared by the electropolymerization of an aniline monomer in the presence of chitosan polysaccharide and a CRP template on the Au-SPE surface. Key parameters, including the removal agent, scanning rate and the number of electropolymerization cycles, were systematically optimized. Optimal MIP performance, characterized by an enhanced electrochemical response upon recognition of the template molecules, was achieved using a scan rate of 50 mV/s and five electropolymerization cycles. The results demonstrated that this biocompatible biosensor platform exhibited exceptional selectivity and sensitivity, enabling the detection of CRP at concentrations ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. The incorporation of chitosan into the MIP matrix represents a strategic advancement with significant potential for healthcare applications, owing to its inherent biocompatibility and well-documented benefits in tissue engineering. Additionally, chitosan improves the stabilization of macromolecular templates and enhances their binding interactions with functional monomers.

The performance of the cellular compressed collagen patch was then tested on a rodent acute myocardial infarction model of ischemic heart failure.\n\nRESULTS: By post‑transplantation Day 28, the cellular CC patch improved left ventricular ejection fraction when compared to an acellular CC patch and control (cellular: 49.1 ± 1.8%; acellular: 38.0 ± 2.6%; control: 39.2 ± 2.1%; ANOVA P = .0006). Cellular CC patch transplantation also induced mature angiogenesis as shown by arteriolar density (cellular: 1084 ± 98 αSMA+vWF+/mm2; acellular: 338 ± 57 αSMA+vWF+/mm2; control: 449 ± 39 αSMA+vWF+/mm2; ANOVA P = .0003) and vascular maturation index (cellular: 0.67 ± 0.04; acellular: 0.48 ± 0.02; and control: 0.46 ± 0.04, P = .001).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, transplantation of a rapidly manufacturable EPC‑SMC‑based compressed collagen patch effectively rescues myocardial function by enhancing neovascularization and attenuating post‑infarction myocardial injury.", "relevance_score": 3.726, "relevance_hits": ["collagen", "muscle", "performance"]}

Previous research suggests per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can interfere with glucose metabolism and kidney function, but their impact on pancreas-kidney inter-organ crosstalk is unclear. In this study, we conducted a three-wave repeated-measures analysis, in a non-diabetic, non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohort. We assessed 23 PFAS, 23 amino acids, 5 glucose indicators, and 3 renal biomarkers across three visits. Our findings showed that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was linked to both glucose and renal biomarkers, suggesting its potential role in impairing pancreas-kidney crosstalk. We also identified amino acids, particularly serine and citrulline, as key mediators in this process, implicating amino acid metabolism as a common mechanism through which PFOS influences inter-organ communication. Serine was found to positively mediate approximately 50 % of the total effect of PFOS exposure on insulin and glucose metabolism, while citrulline negatively mediated about 15 % of PFOS's effects on kidney function biomarkers. These results highlight PFOS's role in disrupting pancreas-kidney crosstalk within a non-diabetic, non-CKD cohort and provide new insights into amino acid regulation in metabolic and kidney diseases.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of αSAA for detecting αSyn in CSF for diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in a clinical cohort of cognitively impaired individuals. We explored how the coexistence of Alzheimer disease (AD) and αSyn pathology influences biomarker levels and clinical profiles. This study contributes to the understanding of αSAA diagnostic performance for DLB and for detecting αSyn copathology in AD in a real-world memory clinic cohort, using both clinical and biomarker-based classifications.\n\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional observational cohort study of cognitively impaired individuals who attended a tertiary memory clinic in Spain between 2009 and 2024. Participants had neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative cognitive decline. αSAA was performed on CSF samples collected at first evaluation. The diagnostic performance of the assay for DLB and associations between AD/αSyn copathology, clinical features, and fluid biomarkers (phosphorylated-tau217 [p-tau217], glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were analyzed in AD and DLB participants. Diagnostic performance of the test was assessed using standard contingency tables and interactions between biomarkers and clinical features with age, sex, and APOE-adjusted analysis of covariance.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 640 participants were included (mean age 67.8 years, 48% female) with clinical diagnoses of AD (n = 337), DLB (n = 92), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (n = 79), non-neurodegenerative cognitive impairment (n = 100), and cognitively unimpaired controls (n = 32). αSAA exhibited a 95.7% sensitivity (95% CI 91.6%-99.8%), 93.2% specificity (95% CI 90.4%-96.0%), and a 93.6% overall diagnostic accuracy for DLB. Among patients with AD, 9.5% were αSAA positive; these individuals more often had core DLB features at presentation, higher APOE ε4 frequency, and elevated plasma p-tau217. Fifty percent of DLB patients showed AD copathology, associated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, higher APOE ε4 prevalence, and higher CSF and plasma NfL. αSAA+ AD subjects had significantly higher p-tau217 and CSF p-tau181 than DLB AD+ patients.\n\nDISCUSSION: αSAA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for DLB, supporting its clinical utility. AD-DLB copathology is associated with distinct cognitive and biomarker profiles, with varying levels of pathology shaping the clinical phenotype (AD- or DLB-predominant).

By employing this method, researchers can pinpoint biological pathways that exhibit a higher level of enrichment for a given set of genes than would be anticipated by random chance. These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway. Here we propose a novel method to enrich the molecular pathways and prioritize them based on their importance and crucial role in the biological function using the graph and evidence-based approach and customized datasets called PathwayMind. It includes 2648 pathways, 4539 biological events, 2465847 protein-protein interactions and 124717 gene-to-pathway relationships and the role of 3510 unique initial genes in 11,992 molecular pathways. The current manuscript comprises three major steps: The first step is about the data extraction and datasets creation for pathway enrichment, and the second steps comprises pathway perturbation analysis to identify most perturbed biological pathways and the third steps includes validation of this approach along with standalone tools and visualization algorithms which disclose the molecular involvement and improve the interpretability of the results. The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest. The current PathwayMind tool and its datasets could be very useful for the molecular scientists and system biologists who are interested to understand the therapeutic effects of their drugs or understanding the involvement of biological pathways for specific gene sets which does not require any prior bioinformatics training.", "relevance_score": 3.6469, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

Melatonin induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, modulates autophagy, and promotes apoptosis in various tumors, including gastric, ovarian, cervical, oral tongue, colorectal, renal, hepatic, and bladder cancer. In placental choriocarcinoma, melatonin reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, its effects on ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway remain unexplored. It is hypothesized here that the proapoptotic effects of melatonin in choriocarcinoma cells occur through the activation of the UPR pathway. The factors implicated in the UPR (PERK, IRE1ɑ, ATF6, GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, P-eIF2α) pathways were evaluated by Western blot, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry in BeWo (human choriocarcinoma) cells treated with or without melatonin (1 mM). Melatonin significantly increased protein levels of GRP78 (p = 0.0329), IRE1α (p = 0.0394), p-eIF2α (p = 0.0439), ATF4 (p = 0.0267), CHOP (p = 0.0379), Bax and cleaved PARP but did not affect TRAF2 and NFkB protein levels nor XBP1 mRNA splicing. PERK knockdown, via siRNA, prevented the rise in GRP78, p-eIF2α/eIF2α, and ATF4 levels by melatonin. Additionally, melatonin increased early apoptosis in BeWo cells (p = 0.0371) and PERK knockdown increased the susceptibility of BeWo cells to apoptosis when treated with tunicamycin (p = 0.0359), suggesting that ER stress plays a role in BeWo cell survival. This study demonstrates that melatonin activates the PERK-ATF4-P-eIF2α-CHOP pathway and induces early apoptosis in BeWo cells, while PERK deficiency compromises cell survival under ER stress. Our findings suggest that modulating PERK-UPR signaling with melatonin could present a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, including placental choriocarcinoma.", "relevance_score": 3.6058, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. The review was narrative rather than systematic, so no formal risk-of-bias scoring was applied. Eighty percent of studies were conducted on young men, with the first female randomized controlled trial only appearing in 2025, limiting data for females. Sample sizes were typically under 60 participants, and most studies lasted only 8-12 weeks, leaving long-term effects unclear. The muscle-building effects of ashwagandha are evident. “There is a discernible increase in lean mass that’s measured and verifiable,” Dr. Israetel explained, “It comes out to roughly a few pounds of muscle over that typical time course.” Approximately 25-40% of creatine’s muscle-building capacity; modest but meaningful. The results for strength were slightly better: the effects of “40 to 60% of the effect of creatine” for one-rep max improvements, typically showing 5-8% increases over 8-12 week programs. Ashwagandha appears to function through hormonal modulation. “Testosterone makes you jacked, cortisol makes you less jacked,” Dr. Israetel declared. “Testosterone makes you leaner, cortisol makes you less lean.” ( 2 )( 3 ) “If you reduce cortisol substantially with [ashwagandha] and boost testosterone, that’s where many of these other benefits really come from,” Dr. Israetel clarified. Ashwagandha appears to boost VO₂ max significantly, with studies showing approximately 4ml/kg/min improvements over 8-12 weeks. ( 4 ) This enhancement in aerobic capacity could improve recovery between sets and training sessions. Recovery markers showed improvement, demonstrating 10-20% better recovery scale scores and reduced soreness perception. A post shared by Blast Vitality (@blastvitality) Ashwagandha has robust effects on stress management, with multiple studies demonstrating anxiety reduction. ( 5 )( 6 )( 7 )( 8 ) This has psychological and physiological benefits, such as improved training outcomes through better sleep quality and lower chronic cortisol exposure. ( 9 ) While generally safe for most healthy adults, ashwagandha isn’t always completely side-effect-free, with many reports of undesirable mental and physical reactions. Reducing stress and anxiety, though good, could interfere with natural emotions if excessive. The review positions ashwagandha as a “moderate multi-mechanism adjunct” rather than a tier-one supplement like creatine. Ashwagandha provides roughly half of creatine’s physiological effects plus more benefits. Stressful periods like the latter stages of fat loss, when cortisol levels are elevated, may be optimal for ashwagandha dosing. Taking 300-600mg daily of high-quality extract in the morning may offer a low-risk option for modest but noticeable improvements. Always speak to your physician before taking new supplements.

Here's what you need to know.  </p>\n\nOur product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? FOR MOST GUYS , biceps training is pretty straightforward. Including even a single isolation exercise into a balanced strength routine once or twice a week will help you build the strength and flex appeal you're hoping to achieve. The reason: Your bis are engaged in just about every upper body pulling exercise ( chinup , pulldown , bent-over row , etc.) you do, so for most strength training goals, you don’t need to hit them with as many targeted moves as you might for a larger muscle group like your pecs or quads. But if you want to maximize your flex appeal so your arms are the focal point of your physique—even in the winter through a thick puffer jacket—you'll need more focused work. That takes a more dedicated approach like you’ll find in our Ultimate Arms Recomp training plan. That also raises an important question: What’s the ideal number of biceps-focused exercises you should include in your routines for optimum growth? We've got answers. If you’re prioritizing upper arm hypertrophy , you likely have at least one day per week when you really hammer your arms . That training session should contain three dedicated biceps moves that meet the following guidelines: An exercise that you can load maximally, such as a standing dumbbell , barbell, or EZ bar curl. The goal here is to push the limits of your strength so that you struggle to bang out your final few reps with good form. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps An exercise that changes your upper arm angle relative to your torso (e.g., a preacher curl , incline curl , or Bayesian/cable curl). That will challenge your biceps with a different “ strength curve ,” moving the most challenging point of curl from the middle to the beginning or end of the movement. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps An exercise that changes your wrist angle to emphasize your brachialis , the muscle directly beneath your biceps that’s just as important for upper arm girth and even more important for elbow flexion. The hammer curl, reverse curl , and Zottman curl are all excellent options. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps Performing an exercise from each of those categories will help ensure maximum muscle fiber recruitment and engagement. This approach will also inject your arm training with enough variety to avoid strength plateaus—as long as you continue to reach for heavier weights as you get stronger and switch up the exercises you perform about every two months. The short answer is: probably not. The long answer requires some context. If we expand our muscular view beyond the biceps, research shows that three targeted exercises (or about 10 total sets) is the minimum weekly recommendation for maximum growth, with the sweet spot likely closer to six exercises (or 20 total sets). So why limit yourself when it comes to your biceps? The answer is that those two-headed elbow flexors are among your body’s top workhorses, assisting other muscles as “secondary” movers in countless other exercises. Not only do your biceps kick into gear during isolation moves such as those mentioned above, but they also spring into action during just about every upper body pulling exercise you can imagine. That means every time you perform a pullup, pulldown, or row variation, you enlist your bis to help get the job done. They’re even engaged during exercises such as the deadlift and farmer’s walk to maintain grip strength and elbow joint tension and stability. That’s why performing more than three to six targeted biceps exercises a week will be overkill—even for those prioritizing arm growth. And if such growth is a priority, it’s also important not to neglect your triceps. After all, they comprise about two-thirds of your upper arms’ mass. Fortunately, the same rules apply when selecting triceps exercises. Check out our picks for the best 15 triceps exercises to round out your arm training.

The swollen sensation that comes when your target muscles are engorged with blood is the highlight of training for many meatheads, so much so that \"chasing the pump\" is a go-to descriptor for a particular approach to workouts, filled with marathon sets to capture the feeling. Yes, you can build muscle when you chase the pump—but you're leaving gains on the table when you exhaust yourself in its pursuit. There are limitations to what you can accomplish when you're training with that objective, since you'll likely be using isolation exercises to target specific muscles rather than compound movements and lighter weights to be able to take on a high volume of reps. You won't be able to train as intensely as you need to for maximal muscle growth. There are more effective ways to build muscle and more efficient methods to go about it. Specifically, an approach often called reps in reserve (RIR). The approach is relatively simple, according to MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., who broke it down as a solution to the common mistake of chasing the pump in his Don't List video for building muscle. Using RIR in your workouts will allow you to train with the intensity needed to create stimulus for muscle growth, and the concept is exactly as the name implies: RIR refers to the amount of reps you could realistically perform (with good form) if you were to keep going after the prescribed reps were completed. Here's how to apply it: For all of the working sets of your session, challenge yourself to the point that you feel like you would only be able to complete two more reps. You're not training to failure here; that approach can be useful in specific scenarios, but you would burn out too quickly to achieve the type of muscle-building stimulus you're hoping to elicit if you fail each set. If your training plan was to perform 3 sets of 8 reps, for example, you would push to make the eighth rep hard enough that you would only be able to perform two more with good form. \"The final rep that you do is going to be slower than the earlier reps that you did, and is going to be hard and challenging,\" Samuel says. \"You might have a little bit of doubt whether you can actually complete the rep with good form.\" That struggle is what you're aiming to achieve. Samuel says that it's okay if your form wavers a bit near the end—but make sure that you don't push beyond your limits. If you find yourself finishing that final rep easily, on the other hand, that doesn't mean to push to 10 or 12 reps for every set. Instead, use that as a gauge of your effort. That's a sign to use heavier weights so that you can reach the level of intensity you're aiming to achieve. Want to know more about building real muscle?

We've got answers.</p>\n\nPOP QUIZ: HOW many reps and sets should you do per exercise to build muscle? If you’re in the know, you're aware that the answer is generally three to four sets of eight to 12 reps (although recent research has shown muscle building can occur at lower rep ranges, too ). You likely also understand that load, rest period duration , and training frequency are also key variables when it comes to packing on lean mass. After all, hypertrophy (the technical term for muscle growth) is largely a numbers game, and getting the equation right can equal maximum gains in minimal time. You want to work hard, but your goal should be to work efficiently. Junk volume is a real problem you'll want to avoid—especially if you're working with limited time. With that in mind, there’s one aspect of weight room arithmetic that many guys get wrong (or at least overlook): How many exercises you should perform per muscle group to optimize your results. “More is better” is the most common approach, but research shows that there are lower and upper limits to this muscle math—and hitting the sweet spot between them is key to getting (and staying) on the hypertrophy fast track. The answer is different if your goal is strength or endurance (and more experienced lifters will be able to handle more volume), but if your primary focus is muscle growth, you should perform a minimum of three exercises per muscle group per week. Those exercises can be performed during a single workout (if you’re doing traditional split training, for example) or spread across two or three workouts (if you’re hitting your whole body each time), but the key is to perform at least three exercises per muscle group per week. (We’ll get into how to select those exercises in the next section.) This applies to the big muscle groups, like the legs and back. For smaller muscle groups like the biceps, triceps, and shoulders, where lots of exercises will be single-joint movements, you can aim for fewer sets. \"Perhaps one to two exercises,\" advises Men's Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., \"since the functions of those muscles are simpler.\" Also, keep in mind that the more complicated compound exercises will also involve those muscle groups, so you're training them that way, too. What’s the maximum number? That’s a good question—and one that science has yet to answer. Stacking on extra sets for each muscle group might also not be a realistic approach for regular guys with busy schedules. Who has time for that kind of targeted exercise volume except elite bodybuilders? In the real world, the consensus is that if you do between 10 and 20 sets (roughly three to six exercises) per muscle group per week, you’ll achieve the muscle-building sweet spot. Let’s start with the lower end of the spectrum, three exercises per week—a number that can be performed in a single workout or distributed across two or three training sessions, depending on your goals and schedule. Priority number one is to select an exercise that moves the targeted muscle group through maximum contraction and extension, and the associated joints through a full range of motion. If we’re talking quads, the barbell back squat is the perfect example. Next, you want to choose an exercise that varies one of the following three variables: plane of motion , angle of attack (in other words, varying the position of the exercise from the first exercise), or portion of the strength curve (where in the movement you'll be forced to exert the most force to complete the rep). Still focusing on the quads, that might mean a side squat, a leg press, or a front-loaded squat, respectively. Finally, choose a challenging bodyweight exercise . Make no mistake, unweighted moves aren’t just for beginners. In almost every instance, there’s a bodyweight exercise that can be just as challenging (or even more so) than its fully loaded counterpart. In the case of the squat, that exercise could be the pistol squat , which is performed on one leg at a time. (If you can’t perform an unassisted pistol squat, hold onto a stable pole or other supportive structure to make it easier.) Keep building your arsenal for each muscle group from there if you plan on hitting them more than once per week. The key is variation (within a structured program, of course). By consistently challenging each muscle group in multiple ways, you’ll ensure enough exercise variety in your training plan to not only maximize growth, but also to avoid plateaus.

Wait, what? Cardio and core? Before you click away, continue reading. The truth is, if you’re still training cardio and core separately, now’s the time to try combining both workouts—it can be a more efficient way to double your sweat return. Here’s where you can begin: This 15-minute bodyweight circuit blends high-intensity intervals with core-strengthening moves that not only burn calories but also build strength, coordination, and toughness. It targets your midsection through rotation, anti-rotation, and isometric tension while keeping your heart rate sky-high. All you need is your body, towels, open floor space, and 15 minutes to get after it. Whether you’re looking for a conditioning finisher or a standalone session, this one’s for you. When you combine core exercises with cardio-style intervals, you’re not just building abs; you’re also training your heart and lungs to be more efficient , rotate stronger, and resist fatigue where it matters most. This 30/30 format (30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest) balances effort and recovery while allowing you to push yourself hard. What makes this circuit effective is that each move challenges your core from different angles through rotation, anti-rotation, bracing, or balancing. You’re not just torching calories. You’re:  To maximize this workout, follow my tips below because when done well, it builds strength while burning calories. Here’s how to make every second count:  You’ll perform each exercise after a warm-up for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of rest, and repeat for three total rounds. 1A. Bodyweight Woodchopper (15 seconds per side) Targets: Obliques, shoulders, glutes, coordination Tip: Let the rotation come from your hips and torso, not your arms alone. 1B. Alternating Skater Hop to Stick Targets: Glutes, quads, adductors, core, balance Tip: Focus on landing quietly and your knee aligned with your foot. 1C. Alternating Rotational Mountain Climbers Targets: Rectus Abs, obliques, hip flexors, shoulders Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked over your wrists and your hips low. Twist with intent, not momentum. 1D. Hollow Hold Flutter Kicks Targets: Lower abs, hip flexors, core stability Tip: If your lower back arches, scale by raising the legs higher or bending the knees. 1E. Push-Up to Shoulder Tap Targets: Chest, triceps, shoulders, core stability Tip: Widen your feet to stay balanced and avoid excessive torso twisting. Avoid swaying or sagging, as you should keep your hips locked in. When you’re finished, your core’s cooked, your shirt’s soaked, and your body is buzzing with endorphins. You didn’t just get a sweat, you trained rotational power, dynamic stability, and cardiovascular endurance in just 15 minutes. Then walk away from this workout knowing you’ve accomplished something efficient and effective. This circuit isn’t your typical cardio. It’s core-focused, athlete-oriented, and built for real-world strength. Use it as a finisher, a standalone session, or a quick option when time is limited but you still want results. Having limited equipment is no reason to not make limitless physique-crushing gains. When your schedule is full, a dumbbell and a few minutes is all you need to get it done.

It started with the German Olympic weightlifting team in the 1970s. GVT became known for its simplicity: choose a big lift , perform 10 sets of 10 reps, and let the volume push your body to grow. No gimmicks, just a high volume and the grit to push through it. Here, we’ll explain exactly what GVT is, who it’s best suited for, its pros and cons, and, if you’re ready, provide a sample workout so you can see if you have what it takes to handle this physical and mental challenge.  German Volume Training was popularized in the 1970s by German national weightlifting coach Rolf Feser as a method to help lifters advance to a higher weight class during the off-season. The premise was unforgiving but straightforward—expose the muscles to an extreme amount of work in a short period to force rapid hypertrophy. In North America, strength coach Charles Poliquin brought GVT into the spotlight in the 1990s, writing about it and refining it for modern lifters. His adaptations preserved the essence of the program—high volume, controlled rest, and a laser focus on compound lifts—while making it more accessible to gym-goers outside the competitive weightlifting world. At its core, German Volume Training is about one thing—overloading your muscles with volume so they have no choice but to grow. The key number? 10 sets of 10 reps for a single big, compound movement. Here’s what makes it tick: The combination of high volume, controlled rest, and focused exercise selection creates an environment that enhances both physical strength and mental resilience. The program is best suited for: If you’re new to lifting, short on time, or still mastering the basics, this method is like trying to run a marathon before you’ve jogged a mile. Before trying any new program, even ones that have been around for over 50 years, like German Volume Training, it pays to weigh up your pros and cons, so you know if it’s right for you. GVT is excellent for a short, focused hypertrophy phase when your recovery is optimal. If you’re looking for maximum strength or are already low on sleep and stressed, a moderate-volume plan with more extended rest periods is the better choice.  If you’ve made it this far and are still eager to give GVT a try, start with this 6-week workout, which focuses on the basics. Split: 3 days per week with a full-body emphasis over the week. Main Lift: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM. Rest: Upper body: 60 to 90 seconds between sets Lower body: 90 to 120 seconds between sets Progression: When you hit all 10×10 with good form, increase the load by 2–3% the following week. Accessory Work: Keep it light, around 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps. 1. Back or Front Squat: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM, (90 to 120 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Romanian Deadlift: 3 sets, 10–12 reps @80% 1 RM 2B. Ab Rollout: 3 sets, 6-10 reps 1. Barbell Bench Press Variation: 10 sets 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Pull-Up (weighted if possible): 3 sets, 6–10 reps 2B. Stability Bent-Over Reverse Fly: 3 sets, 10–15 reps (per side) 1. Trap-Bar Bent-Over Row: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Conventional or Trap Bar Deadlift: 3 sets, 6 reps 2B. Isometric Elevated Split Squat: 3 sets, 30-45 sec. per side Weeks 1–2: Focus on good form and completing all sets and reps. Weeks 3–4: Once you hit 10×10, add weight (2-5 pounds for upper-body exercises and 5-10 pounds for lower body exercises). Weeks 5–6: Push yourself to the upper end of your capacity if you meet all your reps in week four and add weight. If the increase is too much, you can decrease the weight during your working sets. Mobility and stretching on off days are crucial for staying injury-free. Wasn’t that fun? The rise of the hybrid athlete continues with this multi-faceted approach to fitness. These guidelines can make the difference in helping protect your workout partner from injury. Master this final piece to the physique puzzle and take your gains to the next level.", "source": "blogs", "source_type": "blog_article", "is_verified": false, "relevance_score": 3.2, "relevance_hits": ["muscle"]}

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Few things feel more invigorating than lacing up your hiking boots and exploring a new trail . From the sun-drenched days of summer to crisp autumn afternoons, hiking connects you with nature while feeding the mind, body, and soul. The newest trend to hit the trails? “Soft hiking,” which is all about keeping things light and intentional. We spoke with experts to learn six soft hiking techniques that actually build more strength than gym workouts after 45. Soft hiking emphasizes moving with purpose at a comfortable pace. You’re still challenging your body while weaving through uneven terrain and engaging your muscles without excessive load. “It uses less intense and slower therapeutic movements, balance, and resistance to natural bodyweight instead of high-impact movements,” says Shahinaz Soliman, MD , board-certified family physician with 20+ years of experience in patient care. “This modality is appropriate in people over 45 because it encourages building strength at a long-term, low-risk level that honors joint health and recovery requirements.” Inclines introduce a fresh challenge to your hike. Choose easy upward slopes while keeping your step-ups slow and steady. “This is a natural increase of glutes, hamstrings, and calves without the use of heavy weights,” says Soliman. Why People Are Ditching Regular Walks for ‘Nordic Walking’ Navigating objects like rocks and logs is another way to instantly boost the effectiveness of your hike. “The introduction of natural obstacles promotes the use of stabilizer muscles that are not given serious attention in gym machines,” Soliman says. 5 Walking Moves That Shrink Belly Fat Faster Than the Gym After 45 Don’t forget about working your arms! “Trekking poles or recreating arm movements will use upper body muscles and enhance overall coordination and calorie expenditure,” Soliman points out. Balaram Thapa , CEO of Nepal Hiking Team, notes to position the poles so that your elbows are near 90 degrees, and “plant-pull” with every step. Complete six sets of two-minute efforts on rolling ground, activating your core. When going downhill, descend slowly. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e “Slow, controlled [descent] is one of the most effective methods to strengthen quadriceps and enhance balance, compared to walking normally,” Soliman notes. Here’s How Long Your Incline Walking Workout Should Be To Shrink Belly Fat Weave some bodyweight exercises into your hike. The key is pausing and holding the movement. “Pause in lunge or half-squat poses a few times on the way to activate the core and leg muscles in the isometric mode with minimum load on the joints,” Soliman instructs. The #1 Walking Method To Shrink Belly Fat Fast After 50, According to a Trainer Thapa recommends hill repeats: climbing for three to four minutes, descending gradually, and repeating for four to six rounds in total. “Keep steps short, drive through the mid-foot, and breathe rhythmically,” Thapa says. According to Soliman, “Soft hiking combines various muscle groups dynamically and functionally in a natural setting, which puts greater pressure on the body as compared to isolated gym work. Balance, a controlled movement, and weight-bearing activities in uneven terrain encourage the neuromuscular coordination and stability of the joints.” Thapa says soft hiking loads various planes of movement. “[In addition, it] builds eccentric control, and [challenges] balance. You strengthen feet, ankles, knees, and hips together while protecting joints with self-selected pace and terrain.” Outdoor exercise promotes longer workout sessions and sustainability. In adults 45+, this equals safer strength gains and far less boredom that’s often associated with standard gym routines. Looking for easy ways to lose fat?

If you’re on a weight loss mission, your diet matters as much as hitting the gym. Being consistent with healthy meals plays a major part in dropping unwanted pounds and what you eat for dinner can make all the difference. While fad diets get a lot of attention on social media, trends don’t always deliver long-term results, but eating the right food does. To help kickstart your wellness journey, here are five dinners that are packed with flavor, nutrition and can help you slim down in 30 days, according to nutritionist Rania Batayneh , MPH author of the bestselling book, The One One One Die t. According to Batayneh, this salmon dish proves healthy and can also be quick and delicious. “Chilean salmon isa nutrition powerhouse, packed with omega-3 fats, vitamin D, and other nutrients that keeps your heart, brain, eyes, and joints happy. It is also one of the lowest-mercury seafood options and an FDA “Best Choice” for families. I often recommend,” She adds, “Chilean salmon because it delivers so much nutrition in a safe, affordable way. Keep a few frozen fillets on hand and you can have dinner on the table in minutes since they thaw in just 15 minutes. Served with asparagus and a tangy lemon dill yogurt sauce, this meal is fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.” Ingredients (Serves 2) 2 Chilean salmon fillets (4–5 ounces each) 1 bunch asparagus, bottoms trimmed 1 tbsp olive oil Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tbsp Greek yogurt 1 tbsp lemon juice 4 cherry tomatoes 1 tsp fresh dill, chopped Instructions 1. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Sear salmon skin-side down for 4–5 minutes, then flip and cook another 4–5 minutes, until cooked through. 2. In the same pan, sauté asparagus until tender. 3. Stir together Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and dill for the sauce. 4. Plate salmon with asparagus, spoon the sauce over top, and finish with cherry tomatoes. He Lost 100 Lbs After Stopping These 5 Eating Out Mistakes Protein 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e This Shrimp Fajita Bowl with Sorghum is a colorful, one-pan meal that layers shrimp, peppers, and onions over whole grain sorghum. Batayneh explains, “Sorghum is naturally gluten-free and provides essential nutrients including protein, fiber, iron, and antioxidants. As a source of fiber and resistant starch, sorghum helps regulate blood sugar levels, supports healthy digestion, and contributes to satiety. Finished with zesty spices, lime, and cilantro, this recipe is simple, flavorful, and nourishing. Ingredients (Serves 4) ½ cup dry whole grain sorghum (about 1½ cups cooked) 2 lbs shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 bell peppers, sliced 1 small red onion, sliced 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp cumin ½ tsp garlic powder Salt and pepper, to taste Fresh lime wedges and cilantro, for garnish Instructions 1.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and sauté until shrimp are pink andvegetables are tender, about 5–7 minutes. 4. Divide sorghum into bowls and top with shrimp and vegetables. 5. Garnish with lime and cilantro. Salmon is already a powerhouse of lean protein and omega-3 fats, but when you add pistachios, you boost both flavor and nutrition. “Pistachios bring plant-based protein, heart-healthy fats, and fiber to the plate, along with 30 vitamins and minerals,” says Batayneh.  “In this recipe, the jalapeño pistachios form a crunchy crust that pairs perfectly with the zesty cilantro-lime marinade, creating a dish that’s as nourishing as it is delicious. Roasted with potatoes, it’s a balanced meal that supports steady energy, satiety, and overall wellness.” Ingredients (Serves 4) 2 cups fresh cilantro 2 cloves minced garlic ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided Zest and juice of 1 lime 4 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1–1½ inches thick ½ cup jalapeño pistachios, divided 1½ pounds small potatoes, halved ½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided Instructions 1.

Bake until potatoes are tender and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. 6. Plate salmon and potatoes. Garnish with reserved pistachio mixture and remaining pistachios. This ABC Taco Salad is all about avocado, black beans, and cilantro. “Black beans bring plant-based protein and fiber that help keep you full and satisfied, while also providing key minerals like iron and magnesium,” Batayneh explains. She adds, “Creamy avocado steps in for cheese or sour cream, adding healthy fats and a rich texture. A squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro brighten the dish, making it as flavorful as it is nourishing.” Serve it as a hearty salad, enjoy it in warm corn tortillas, or pair it with rice for a balanced bowl. Ingredients (Serves 6) Cooking spray 2 cans (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained 1⁄4 cup water 2 avocados, peeled, pitted, and finely chopped 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup cilantro fresh, chopped 1⁄4 cup finely chopped sweet onion 1⁄4 teaspoon salt 3 limes, cut in half *6 corn tortillas (gluten-free)- optional Instructions: 1.

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Strength training after 40 might seem trickier than it was in your 20s and 30s, but the essence stays the same. It’s about staying powerful, protecting your joints, and building the kind of strength that supports everything from weekend activities to long-term health. Standing exercises are one of the best tools to get there. They engage your entire body, demand balance, and keep your core active while you move through strength-building patterns . Unlike traditional dumbbell routines that isolate one muscle group at a time, standing movements challenge multiple muscles together. This creates a stronger foundation for daily life and reduces your risk of injury. You’re not just training arms or legs—you’re training stability, coordination, and control in ways that carry over to real-world movement. The payoff is more than stronger muscles . Standing exercises improve posture, help protect your spine, and keep your hips, knees, and shoulders moving well as you age. That combination keeps you feeling younger, more capable, and less likely to deal with aches that slow progress. The six exercises ahead show how dumbbells can be used in creative ways that go beyond the basics. Each one builds strength that lasts, supports resilience, and helps you get more out of every workout after 40.  Side bends strengthen the often-neglected oblique muscles that protect your spine and improve rotational control. Past 40, building strength in the midsection goes beyond looks—it supports posture, protects your back, and helps you generate power in other lifts. Muscles Trained: Obliques, abdominals, erector spinae, hip flexors How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds. Best Variations: Suitcase carries, side planks with reach, kettlebell side bends Form Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked and avoid twisting your torso as you bend. 5 Power Exercises That Torch Belly Fat Faster Than Treadmill Workouts After 45  The push press builds explosive upper body strength while engaging the lower body for added support. It mimics athletic movement and teaches your body to transfer power from the ground up. After 40, this type of coordinated effort keeps your joints mobile and your muscles firing together. Muscles Trained: Shoulders, triceps, quadriceps, glutes, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps. Rest for 75 to 90 seconds. Best Variations: Barbell push press, single-arm push press, kettlebell push press Form Tip: Keep your core tight and avoid overarching your back as you drive the weights overhead. 5 Daily Bodyweight Exercises That Keep You Young After 40  Ski swings replicate the explosive hip drive of kettlebell swings but with dumbbells held at your sides. This builds posterior chain strength, cardiovascular endurance, and total-body coordination. For those over 40, it offers a safe yet effective way to enhance athleticism and conditioning. Muscles Trained: Hamstrings, glutes, lower back, shoulders, forearms How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 seconds. Best Variations: Kettlebell swing, alternating dumbbell ski swing, resistance band ski swing Form Tip: Hinge at your hips rather than squatting. The power should come from your glutes, not your arms. 5 Driveway Stretches That Reverse Stiffness Better Than Massage Therapy After 50  Woodchops train rotational strength and core stability, which are critical for longevity and performance. This movement extends to sports, daily tasks, and injury prevention. After the age of 40, training the body in twisting motions helps keep your spine strong and resilient. Muscles Trained: Obliques, abdominals, shoulders, hips How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps per side. Rest for 60 seconds. Best Variations: Cable woodchop, medicine ball rotational slam, landmine twist Form Tip: Rotate through your hips and shoulders together. Avoid twisting only through your lower back. If You Can Hold a Bridge for This Long After 50, Your Glutes Are Stronger Than Most  Split squats build unilateral lower body strength, improve balance, and reduce muscle imbalances. For adults past 40, this move is a joint-friendly way to develop leg power and stability without heavy barbell loading. Muscles Trained: Quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, calves, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps per leg. Rest for 60 to 75 seconds. Best Variations: Bulgarian split squat, front-rack split squat, bodyweight split squat Form Tip: Keep your torso upright and avoid letting your front knee cave inward.  The see-saw row builds upper back strength and core stability in a dynamic manner. Unlike traditional rows, alternating sides challenge balance and force your core to resist rotation. After 40, this is a valuable way to strengthen your posture and maintain a healthy back. Muscles Trained: Lats, rhomboids, rear delts, erector spinae, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 10 to 12 reps per arm. Rest for 60 seconds.

Build muscle safely (and productively) with this BS-free, teen-focused program.  </p>\n\nWith back-to-school season in full effect, teen boys are once again set to be deluged with social media posts reminding them they need to get strong—and workouts that claim to get them strong. Many of those programs aren't optimized for young bodies, though. This program, however, is for them—and it's the program I wish I had when I was a youngster. - Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., MH Fitness Director IN THE ERA of TikTok and Instagram, teenagers often start their fitness journeys in the wrong place. They build workouts around information gleaned from 90-second social-media posts by uncredentialed fitness influencers who don't truly understand the science of muscle and strength. The resulting fitness routines are typically not optimized for teenaged bodies as they grow. The result: Frustration, which can manifest in many ways in the social media era. When kids become unhealthily obsessed with fitness, that frustration can transform into questionable supplement usage—and, sometimes, body dysmorphia. It's a devastating chain of events that we chronicle in Generation Flex , the first full-length documentary from Men’s Health , which is out now. None of this, though, means that kids and teens shouldn't hit the gym, because strength training has serious benefits for growing bodies. Research has shown that those aged 13 to 19 who lift weights have better body composition, cardiovascular health, and movement coordination. And that's where our Ultimate Teenaged Muscle-U p , a four-week PDF strength workout program, comes into play. Designed by Men’s Health Advisory Board member, David Otey, C.S.C.S. , it's meant to be the antidote to all the fitness BS on social media, and an answer to every teenager's strength pursuits. The problem with Instagram strength advice—whether you're 13 or 53—is that it can often lead you to do exercises that simply don't get you the gains you truly want. For teens in particular, too many social-media-driven workouts can lead to poor training fundamentals, which curtail their gains in the long term. Worst of all, these flashy routines invite an overall lack of results: Plenty of influencers deliver quick bodyweight ab workouts, but no, that won’t get teens the washboard abs they seek. It's for all these reasons that some might tell you not to let your teen strength train at all. But that's not the best solution. Choosing proper exercises is key, and the right plan helps to keep teens from spending hours upon hours in the weight room, too. Teenaged bodies are full of natural growth hormone and testosterone, so they’re often primed for serious gains in muscle, strength, and athleticism, as long as they do the right moves. And that means teens can get results efficiently—which leaves plenty of time for active social lives and classroom gains, too. This program has you covered. Otey has trained a host of teenagers as well as many adults, and he understands both the strengths and weaknesses that adolescents have when they hit the gym. This program is specifically built with growing bodies in mind. It’s attentive to the fact that teenagers sometimes struggle to learn proper form on critical lifts by loading up on reps instead of pushing for bench press max-outs. It also takes advantage of the endless energy that teens have by delivering daily full-body workouts. It’s the perfect gym entry point for any teen, and it’s built around the latest science, driving at power training, multiplanar training, and movements that permit full range of motion and plenty of time under tension for muscles in lengthened positions. This type of program—and not specious \"experts\" on Instagram and TikTok—is what will get teens and kids the gains they want as they continue to grow, setting them up for a healthier, fitter life.

Nippard hopes to further the world of fitness by conducting his own in-house experiments there, too. We take a look inside. “For the last two years, I’ve been secretly building the most scientific gym on the planet,” revealed Nippard on September 15, 2025, without pinpointing its exact location. Rather than being offered to the public, it’s likely that Nippard’s new facility will play host to future demonstration videos and data crunching, but he does intend to train there himself. Beyond the lobby are two differently styled gyms, explained the fitness fanatic. “Behind this door is the ‘dark side’ and behind this door is the ‘light side.’” he explained in videos posted to social media. The light side appears to be more strength and lower body based, comprising of machines such as the pendulum squat and leg extension, along with a deadlift platform and a glute drive machine. There’s also a donkey calf raise machine, squat press and leg curl machines, in addition to a squat rack and smith machine. “The dark side is more bodybuilding and machine focused,” explained the innovator, revealing that equipment in this area includes a plate loaded seated row, a standing lateral rase machine, hack squat station, seal row, plate loaded chest press, a seated pec deck, seated cable row, and a fully adjustable cable machine. The whole facility is also adorned with custom weights and plates, putting Nippard’s stamp of approval on the new venture.  A post shared by Jeff Nippard (@jeffnippard)  In addition to the two distinct exercise areas is the jewel of Nippard’s crown, known as The Muscle Lab. The changemaker revealed that this space contains a DEXA scan for measuring fat, muscle, and bone density. There’s also an ultra-sound machine for creating real-time pictures and videos of the body’s soft tissues. The Muscle Lab houses a BIA (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis) machine for further measuring of body composition. “Using these devices, now I’m going to be able to run my own scientific studies,” he said proudly. “I’m so excited.” Jeff Nippard has pointed out that his new fitness space has come to fruition thanks to profits made from his MacroFactor training app . “So thank you so much for making it a reality,” he wrote via Instagram.

Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb.

Advancements in preoperative fasting guidelines have shifted towards more flexible approaches, such as allowing clear liquids up to 2 h before surgery and encouraging carbohydrate loading before elective surgery to improve glucose regulation and recovery. Prehabilitation strategies, including protein-rich nutrition and physical activity, improve postoperative recovery, particularly in frail patients. In the neurocritically ill, early enteral nutrition (EN) with low-to-moderate protein and calorie targets improves functional recovery and reduces complications. Recent studies challenge the necessity of prolonged fasting before extubation and ICU procedures. Despite evidence supporting reduced fasting, adherence to protocols remains low.\n\nSUMMARY: Advances in perioperative fasting protocols will likely improve recovery for neurosurgical patients.

Additionally, many methods fail to adequately account for matrix effects, which can lead to significant discrepancies in reported values. This review underscores the importance of selecting validated analytical approaches that consider matrix effects to obtain reliable data on NPN components in IF. By enhancing the understanding of NPN quantification in infant nutrition, this work aims to highlight the importance of standardized and validated analytical protocols, thereby improving consistency in the identification and quantification of key NPN components in IF.", "relevance_score": 2.8776, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "protein", "quality"]}

Today, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) enhances skin quality by promoting collagen synthesis, elasticity, and hydration. Minimal invasive aesthetic treatment could add value to this patient group.\n\nMETHODS: To assess the relationship between menopause, hormones, and HRT on skin health, we conducted a comprehensive literature search using the terms (menopause OR menopausal) AND (aging OR aging) AND (skin) AND (estrogen OR estrogen OR hormones) AND (hormone replacement therapy OR HRT). To explore aesthetic treatments specific to menopausal women, searches included (\"menopause\" OR \"menopausal\") AND (\"aesthetics\" OR \"aesthetics\" OR \"cosmetic\" OR \"filler\"). Additional studies were identified from references in the uncovered articles.\n\nRESULTS: We reviewed the impact of hypoestrogenism and HRT on menopausal skin and identified unmet needs in its aesthetic management. Most studies reported positive associations between HRT and improvements in menopausal skin aging, but findings were sometimes inconsistent. Despite decades of research, clinical guidelines do not support HRT use solely for estrogen-deficient skin due to a lack of robust clinical trials on skin-specific therapy. Many women remain unaware of the skin-related impacts of menopause, which can affect quality of life, and few aesthetics studies analyze data based on menopausal status or HRT use. Given the growing demand for aesthetic treatments in this population, future studies should intentionally incorporate demographic data and analyses on menopausal status and HRT use.", "relevance_score": 2.8726, "relevance_hits": ["collagen", "quality"]}

The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by an independent review (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, RECIST v1.1), while the primary safety endpoint was frequency and severity of adverse events. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 198 anti-programmed cell death protein-1 therapy-naïve patients with confirmed HPV16-positive recurrent/metastatic oropharyngeal cancer were randomized to receive cemiplimab plus peltopepimut-S (n=100) or placebo (n=99). The trial did not meet its primary objective (ORR, 25.3% in peltopepimut-S arm vs 22.9% in placebo arm; p=0.735). The median OS (mOS) and PFS in the placebo arm were unexpectedly longer than in the peltopepimut-S arm (26.9 vs 15.8 months) and (20.3 vs 5.5 months), respectively. In predefined exploratory analyses this was associated with an excess death rate from progressive disease in patients with pre-treatment programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) <20. In contrast, patients with CPS ≥20 had a higher ORR of 51.7% (95% CI, 32.5% to 70.6%) vs 25.8% (95% CI, 11.9% to 44.6%) and a longer mOS in the peltopepimut-S arm (34.8 vs 28.8 months) compared with the placebo arm, respectively. If patients had received all three vaccine or placebo doses, the ORR in patients with CPS ≥20 was 70.0% (95% CI, 45.7% to 88.1%) vs 29.2% (95% CI, 12.6% to 51.1%) in the peltopepimut-S arm and placebo arms, respectively, associated with mOS not reached (after 42 months) versus 23.3 months. The addition of peltopepimut-S to cemiplimab did not increase cemiplimab's toxicity.\n\nCONCLUSION: Adding peltopepimut-S to cemiplimab did not improve ORR and worsened mOS in the primary analysis. Divergent outcomes were seen in patients with pretreatment PD-L1 CPS <20 (worse ORR and mOS compared with placebo) and CPS ≥20 (higher ORR and longer mOS compared with placebo) values.

However, the mechanism by which DUX4 exerts its toxicity remains unclear. In this study, we observed abnormal iron accumulation in muscles of patients with FSHD and in mice with muscle-specific DUX4 expression (DUX4-Tg mice). Treatment with iron chelators, an iron-deficient diet, and genetic modifications inhibiting intracellular uptake of iron did not improve but rather exacerbated FSHD pathology in DUX4-Tg mice. Unexpectedly, however, iron supplementation, from either a high-iron diet or intravenous iron administration, resulted in remarkable improvement in grip strength and running performance in DUX4-Tg mice. Iron supplementation suppressed abnormal iron accumulation and the ferroptosis-related pathway involving increased lipid peroxidation in DUX4-Tg muscle. Muscle-specific DUX4 expression led to retinal vasculopathy, a part of FSHD pathology, which was prevented by iron administration. Furthermore, high-throughput compound screening of the ferroptosis pathway identified drug candidates including ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Treatment with Fer-1 dramatically improved physical function in DUX4-Tg mice. Our findings demonstrate that DUX4-provoked toxicity is involved in the activation of the ferroptosis-related pathway and that supplementary iron could be a promising and readily available therapeutic option for FSHD.", "relevance_score": 2.8317, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "performance", "protein", "strength"]}

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation. These findings provided practical applications for improving the taste of wine and offered a theoretical foundation for modulating undesirable tastes in other beverage systems.", "relevance_score": 2.8137, "relevance_hits": ["mps", "protein"]}

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes. For both polyphenols, binding significantly decreased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic regions, reorganized secondary structure (α-helix loss and β-sheet gain), and markedly enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity.

I have no idea which corticosteroid exactly. Based on the manufacturer’s other products and what I've read about them it’s most likely dexamethasone.\n\nDuring each period I took this supplement, my temples and under-eyes became hollow noticeably. Before taking it, despite being severely underweight for years, I had a lot of volume just UNDER my eyes and my temples weren’t THAT thin (but my cheeks were, obviously) the back of my jaw didn't look big or anything.\n\nThe hollowing worsened with each round of exposure. Looking back, the changes happened only during the times I took the supplement, I didn’t realize it at the time. This is not normal aging. This time this has become too hard to ignore I cannot keep living in denial and I highly suspect the corticosteroid in the supplement has been somehow hurting. My eyes literally look sunken, my face looks absolutely horrible from below/lower angle. My eyes used to be narrow and wide and now they look rounded as if something is constantly very lightly pulling on the bottom of them and there is this weird ridge on my eyelids from it as if there is excess skin.\n\nIn the Summer of 2024 I did a 1-month course. January 2025, 2 week (ish) course. In last may I did a 3 week course and starting on June 20th I did a roughly 45-day course which is the most recent. now I completely stopped.\n\n\nEven though I gained 20 pounds during the last round NONE of the fat went to my temples. they’re still hollow and look even worse than before\n\nMy arms actually gained subcutaneous fat which is really weird since corticosteroids supposedly cause fat loss in the arms. Yes I did get moon face in the lower half of my face (everything under my cheekbone), my stomach got a little bit bigger, but no fat loss in the arms??\n\n\nI also suspect the corticosteroids severely impacted my collagen and skin health my nasolabial folds are now very pronounced my skin barrier feels destroyed, and skin looks unhealthy overall and aged. Indentations on my forehead appeared that weren’t there before. Also after the first time I tried this supplement, I noticed dehydration lines around my mouth that I had never seen before in my life.\n\n\nI cannot find anybody else that has experienced this issue. Everything on reddit and google talks about moon face, buffalo hump, or peripheral limb fat loss, but nothing like this.\n\nI want to make this clear I did not take prescription corticosteroids deliberately. This was a contaminated supplement. I was laced. I'm not trying to promote anything illegal/dangerous and I don't plan on taking this shit ever again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced hollow temples or under-eyes after corticosteroids? Does anyone know how this might have happened and if this might improve after stopping, losing the gained weight, and waiting long-term? Because that's what I plan on doing. I also plan on taking biosil for my collagen, and a multivitamin since my diet has always been pretty lacking. I would seriously appreciate any insight.\n\nTL;DR: Took a Malaysian supplement (Kian Pee Wan) that was secretly laced with corticosteroids. Instead of just “moon face,” I developed severe hollowing in my temples/under eyes and skin/collagen damage that got worse each round.

What do you all know about this? Any research you can point me too?\n\n**History:** I accidentally discovered about 5 years ago that high doses of biotin clear up this severe psori-form type rash I’ve had on my scalp, neck and behind the ears since I was a toddler (no medicine works as well - I’m in my 40’s now). The first time I took it - I was like - Should biotin feel like taking drugs? It was wild. I now take 100mg a day and sometimes need to take more depending on how the rash is doing.\n\nI’ve found other vitamins that I have pretty extraordinary drug like responses to but don’t need to take in such high doses which makes me think biotin might be at the root of these other issues. I’ve been diagnosed with a handful of rare diseases - but it’s pretty improbable - so I think some are from additional vitamin issues/imbalances.\n\n**OTHER INFO:** We have no clue what’s causing this.  I’ve been tested for biotinidase deficiency, had my organic acid tested (oat), and had a whole exome study. Nothing significant was found - though in my OAT test they were high levels of unknown compounds and other suggestions of fatty acid and metabolic issues. And I am also very sensitive to egg whites - even when cooked - which explodes my rash.\n\nI have many other health problems that have slowly come on over adulthood (including a rare type of anemia - sideroblastic anemia). I see a lot of specialists right now - many of them excellent - none of them know much about vitamins in this extreme way - even the natros I’ve seen.

Remdesivir also had anti-inflammatory effect which reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and inhibition of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-STING pathway.\n\nMETHODS: We evaluated the antiarthritic effects of remdesivir in a mouse model of High-fat diet (HFD) collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and in fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with RA. Type II collagen was administered to DBA/1J mice to induce CIA. Vehicle or remdesivir was injected subcutaneously three times a week. During 7 weeks of treatment, the arthritis score and incidence were evaluated twice a week. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging were used to evaluate CD4 + T cells in the spleen. FLSs from patients with RA were stimulated in vitro with remdesivir and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and western blotting was used to measure the expression of STING and necroptosis-related markers.\n\nRESULTS: Remdesivir administration suppressed the incidence and progression of arthritis in mice with CIA. Histological analysis revealed lower inflammation and cartilage damage scores in remdesivir-treated than in vehicle groups. Interleukin (IL)-17 + CD4 + T-cell differentiation was inhibited in the remdesivir-treated group.

Its high prevalence is driven by insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with cardiovascular disease. The main driver of liver damage is fat accumulation in hepatocytes leading to inflammation and fibrosis development. People with MASH and clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2/F3) are 'at risk' of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and are considered in need of treatment. Metabolic drivers of MASH originating outside the liver, for example, from the adipose tissue and the gut, and genetic heterogeneity contribute to making the prevalent pathogenetic factor difficult to dissect at an individual level. In this scenario, the Food and Drug Administration's conditional approval of the liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist Resmetirom as the first pharmacological treatment for MASH last March 2024 and the expected extension of the glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonist Semaglutide indication from diabetes and obesity to MASH mark a key milestone. Both drugs are also under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency. The proven efficacy of these compounds in clinical trials needs to be balanced against safety profiles and patient preferences. To investigate future trajectories and possible uses as mono-therapy or in combination, we examined available results of clinical trials and real-life studies.

These drinks typically contain a variety of components, each of which has been shown to offer individual benefits. However, the combined effects of these components, as formulated in many sports drinks, have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to evaluate the impact of typical sports drink components on endurance performance, perceived exertion, and carbohydrate and fat metabolism, using a sequential additive design.\n\nMETHODS: Twelve healthy, trained endurance athletes aged 20 to 35 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study involved a baseline assessment and four exercise protocols, each separated by a 7-day washout period. During each exercise protocol, participants cycled for 40 minutes at 80% of their previously determined peak oxygen uptake , followed by an incremental protocol performed to voluntary exhaustion. Participants were randomly assigned to ingest one of four 300 ml solutions 60 and 30 minutes before each exercise protocol: solution A (placebo mineral water), solution B (dextrose and sodium), solution C (solution B + beetroot extract), or solution D (solution C + arginine and L-citrulline). Ventilation and heart rate were continuously monitored before and throughout the exercise. Lactate and glucose levels were measured at specific time points before and during the exercise, while ratings of perceived exertion were recorded every 10 minutes. Power output was continuously tracked throughout the exercise protocol. Body weight was assessed both before and after each exercise session.\n\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the four solutions in terms of time to exhaustion (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of the tested sports drink compositions on performance during the selected exercise protocol to voluntary exhaustion appears minimal. This study found no significant differences between the solutions and the placebo.

This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes.

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development.

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects.

When you smell it, it smells spicy in a weird way. When mixed, it tastes a bit bitter unless mixed with more than the recommended amount of water.” Still, she gives it 4 out of 5 points for taste. Additionally, all three of our testers who tried this product had issues with solubility, collectively awarding it 3.5 out of 5 points. They each noted that the powder didn’t dissolve fully, resulting in “floaties” that needed to be shaken up again before each swig. Read our full Transparent Labs Creatine HMB Review . Legion Creatine Gummies are the best creatine gummies overall, and they happen to be vegan-friendly, too. These gummies are formulated with the widely researched creatine monohydrate, and they provide the upper end of the optimal dose, which earns them 4 out of 5 points for formulation. Deductions in their score stem from the use of sugar alcohols, which can cause gastrointestinal distress in some individuals. According to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, “There’s definitely more room for research on creatine gummies, but Legion’s version is intriguing.” The clinically-backed dose, the third-party testing, and the flavor variety are all on her “pros list” for this product, she says. However, if you plan to start creatine supplementation with a loading phase , these gummies may be a no-go for you, she says, due to the fact that each serving contains 8 grams of sugar alcohols. “Research has shown that sugar alcohols like erythritol can cause digestive upset,” Bourgeois points out. “Sugar alcohols may cause nausea, bloating, and diarrhea, among other gastrointestinal effects.” Our tester didn’t have any issues with side effects, and mostly enjoyed their experience with the gummies, rating them with 4 out of 5 points for both taste and texture. They’re “more sweet than tangy and not a ton of flavor but easy enough to get down” and while “these do get stuck in your teeth a little and stick together in the jar,” it’s not a dealbreaker for our tester. Though pricey at about $1.50 per serving, Legion Creatine Gummies earn 4 out of 5 points for price because gummies in general are much more expensive than creatine powder. Legion also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if you don’t like them, no questions asked. This unflavored micronized creatine is available in two different size options and is Informed Sport certified, vegan, and gluten-free. You can even subscribe to recurring deliveries and save 15 percent. It doesn’t get simpler than this: This Sports Research supplement contains creatine monohydrate, and that’s it. No more, no less. “Each dose provides the upper end of what research deems the optimal dose of creatine monohydrate,” our tester says, “and there’s no unnecessary fluff to drive up your cost or potentially cause unwanted symptoms.” As such, this supplement earns 5 out of 5 points for its formula. “Sometimes, less is more in the supplement world,” says registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “You get a research-backed dose of creatine monohydrate here. Because it’s a straightforward supplement, there’s no puzzling it into your routine. It can fit easily.” If purity is a concern, you’ll be pleased to know that Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate is manufactured in a cGMP-compliant facility, Non-GMO Project Verified, NSF certified gluten-free, and NSF Informed Sport-certified. This creatine supplement also earns 5 out of 5 points for taste, or the lack thereof. It’s unflavored, and there’s no taste at all, our tester says. The same goes for solubility, which also earns 5 out of 5: “If you didn’t tell me there was creatine in this water I wouldn’t know. It’s truly tasteless and mixes easily,” our tester raves. That said, “If you’re someone who likes a little flavor in their creatine, you’re out of luck,” Bourgeois says. Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate only comes unflavored.” This no-frills creatine powder earns high marks from our expert product tester. “ProHealth hits all the high points,” they say, awarding it a perfect 5-out-of-5 score for the formula. “You get 5 grams of micronized creatine monohydrate per scoop, and each batch is third-party tested for quality, purity, and potency.” Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois likes the simplicity of ProHealth Longevity Creatine. “You don’t have to sacrifice research-backed dosing of creatine for other ingredients,” she says. “It’s also free of 10 major allergens: dairy, egg, soy, wheat, gluten, corn, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts. Not all creatine products are made in allergen-free facilities.” Bourgeois points out that ProHealth uses Creavitalis , which is marketed as a high-quality and easily absorbed creatine monohydrate, as opposed to the current standard used in most products, CreaPure . “We know creatine has a lot to offer, but I’d love to see more research on Creavitalis, specifically.” Bourgeois says. ProHealth Longevity Creatine earns 4 out of 5 points from our tester for taste. “I noticed a slight aftertaste in water, and my wife thought it tasted metallic, but we didn’t notice this when mixed in a sports drink” he says. Our tester gives it 5 out of 5 points for solubility, noting that it’s much more powdery than other creatines he’s tried so it mixes great, but it does settle at the bottom of the glass or bottle eventually. This product is more expensive than average for a plain creatine monohydrate powder at $0.55 per serving, so it earns 3.5 out of 5 points for price. However, the increased cost may be worth it to those who need a product certified to be free from the 10 major allergens. This extremely inexpensive creatine is micronized for extra solubility. We also appreciate Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate for its available flavor profiles, although the use of sucralose as a sweetening agent may lead to GI distress in some athletes. Fitness enthusiasts on a budget will love that Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate powder costs just 20 cents per serving. A tub of 100 servings will run you a little over $20, or less if you choose to subscribe and save. It earns a perfect score of 5 out of 5 points for price. It has a winning formula, too, earning 4.5 out of 5 points. While it contains the upper end of the clinically backed dose of creatine—5 grams per serving—a half-point deduction comes from the inclusion of sucralose in flavored options. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener known to cause digestive upset in some individuals, which is something to be aware of if you have a sensitive stomach. “Nutricost stays true to its name with this one,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, LDN. “Each serving provides a clinically-backed dose of creatine monohydrate at a budget-friendly price. I love that Nutricost doesn’t limit their dosing to keep your cost per serving low.” In addition to its low price, it tastes good, too. Rather, it tastes like nothing, our tester says, which is ideal for an unflavored creatine product. “It’s actually tasteless, even in water,” they say, awarding it 5 out of 5 points. Nutricost creatine doesn’t score quite as high for solubility, earning a score of 3 out of 5 points. It settles in the bottom of the glass if you don’t drink it in one go, our tester notes. Read our full Nutricost Creatine Review . Our team of product testers, which includes certified personal trainers, certified nutrition coaches, and other health and fitness professionals, spent weeks identifying and testing—yes, actually ingesting—dozens of creatine supplements. We evaluated eight criteria for each product we tried, rating each on a scale from 1 to 5: A score of 1-2 is below average; a score of 3 is average for the industry; a score of 4-5 is above average. These products are also great choices for anyone, including those on a vegan diet. Making a case for creatine isn’t hard: There’s a very long list of creatine benefits . Vegan creatine supplements range in price from about 20 cents per serving to nearly $2 per serving. Expect to pay about $20 to $50 per month, depending on the brand. As you shop for creatine , keep these factors in mind. Creatine monohydrate remains the gold standard. For enhanced bioavailability, look for micronized creatine powder. Other forms of protein, like creatine hydrochloride (HCl) and creatine ethyl ester, have not been proven more effective or beneficial. ( 16 ) Look out for fillers. Except for flavors—and in some cases, depending on the type of supplement (i.e., gummies), preservatives—creatine supplements don’t need many ingredients at all. In fact, some of the best creatine supplements contain just one ingredient: creatine. One common con of creatine is bloating, and minimizing artificial sweeteners and additives can help keep digestion smooth. If you plan to use your creatine pre-workout, consider a formula with caffeine to boost energy levels and further enhance exercise performance. If you want to be sure about the quality and purity of your creatine, look for independent analyses of the contents. The best indicator of quality is a certification from the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), but certificates of composition from any lab can tell you if the product contains any contaminants and if it is properly dosed. The cleanest vegan creatine supplements are those that contain only pure creatine monohydrate powder. Examples include Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate and Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate, both of which have a single ingredient: micronized creatine monohydrate. Yes. Vegan creatine is synthesized in a lab, and most creatine supplements on the market are made that way. Look out for gelatin in capsules and gummies if use of animal products is not negotiable for you. Unfortunately, it’s tough for vegans to get enough creatine from diet alone, since the most potent natural sources include red meat, poultry. and fish. Vegetarians can get small amounts through eggs and dairy products. Luckily, most lab-created creatine products are, in fact, plant-based creatine. Since they are synthesized chemically from the amino acids sarcosine and cyanamide, they do not contain animal byproducts. Exceptions include gelatin in capsules and gummies. Yes, of course. People on a vegan diet can build muscle by following a hypertrophic strength training plan, eating in a calorie surplus, and prioritizing protein and amino acid intake. Creatine is not directly involved in muscle-building processes like muscle protein synthesis. ( 17 ) However, it can improve athletic performance and muscle recovery, leading to increases in muscle strength and power.

In the best cases, these devices offer a bridge between what you subjectively feel and what you can objectively measure. This is generally a really cool and amazing thing. Our subjective feelings and assessments matter, but they’re not always the most reliable. Us humans just aren’t particularly skilled at quantifying our experiences and behaviors with cold precision. Take, for example, a colleague of mine. He believed he was eating within a narrow caloric window, but after careful tracking, he learned that he was putting away a bonus 500 Calories a day—in barbecue sauce. That said, some of us are better than others. Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter, was reported to have been able to call out his 100 metre time within a tenth of a second of the stopwatch readout. 1 That’s outlier performance, to be clear, but it still makes you wonder: And, how can you improve your accuracy through the wise use of technology—like fitness trackers—to help you make better decisions about your health? In the following article, we’ll tackle the above, plus we’ll address: Let’s get into it. Not all data is created equal. Some brands produce better products than others. This is not just hardware but also the quality of their software and datasets. Beyond that, not all things are equally easy to quantity. For example, heart rate and step-count data are generally reliable, 2 but many other types of outputs—from calories burned to movement velocity—have substantial margins for error. The below chart shows the reliability of various tracking devices. (If you’re curious, we cover the accuracy of various progress indicators in more detail here: Are Fitness Trackers Worth It? ) The good: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. The bad: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. “What’s really remarkable,” says Samantha Kleinberg, a computer scientist who studies decision-making, “is that even a tiny amount of surplus information has a big negative effect on our decision-making.” 3 That’s the paradox of tracking: Too little detail makes it tough to make the right decision, but so does too much. This can be expressed as an inverted U, with the sweet spot at the top of the curve. Consider the analysis paralysis you feel after scanning hundreds of reviews from the various taco places in your neighborhood. (All you wanted was a decent el pastor, but now you don’t know which taqueria to pick!) Finding just enough information to make good decisions is an art form—especially in the world of health and fitness, where it seems like everyone is trying to outdo each other when it comes to providing more science, more customization, and more complexity. But when all that information starts to blur together with no clear path forward, what should you do? For starters, you can ask yourself a simple question: Does tracking increase my wellbeing and performance? If the answer is a clear yes or no, you know what to do. (Either continue tracking as you were, or drop the gadget and walk away.) If you’re a little fuzzy, here are three signs to watch for to help you determine if tracking is helpful—or not. When Zak’s coach raved about the benefits of zone 2 cardio, it sounded logical. But when the rubber on his running shoes hit the road, Zak second-guessed everything. Zak prided himself on his ability to grind, and simply didn’t trust that something that felt easy could also be effective. Yet, the data didn’t lie. As the weeks went by, Zak watched his resting heart rate drop—along with his recovery time from hard runs. With that reassurance, Zak began to relax about the process—and his resting heart rate dropped further. Zak hadn’t trusted his feelings, but he did trust the data from his heart rate monitor. Using a tracking device enabled Zak to calibrate his own perceptions so they were more accurate and realistic. If you’re a coach who has a client like Zak who’s high performing but doesn’t know it, tracking can help build confidence and reduce the anxiety that they’re “not good enough.” Here, you empower them by shining a spotlight on existing performance. Expert assurance can go a long way but can also be bolstered by reliable data. (Recently, many people have begun using continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, in order to “optimize” their blood sugar levels. This can help “validate” certain food choices… but it can also be a waste of time. Read more: Should people without diabetes use CGMs? ) Sometimes, data can stress you out without any upside—like when you receive poor scores about things beyond your control. Take the new parent of a newborn who gets a poor sleep quality score. Tracking has a time and a place. When scores are beyond your control or your priorities lie elsewhere, tracking can create unnecessary stress and is counterproductive. You can always revisit tracking when circumstances or priorities change. For a behaviour to take place, you need three things 4 : Fitness trackers shine when you’ve got plenty of motivation and ability—and just lack the prompt. Take my client, Margaret. She used to have a glass of wine most nights, believing it helped her sleep better. Once she started wearing a sleep tracker though, she saw that her sleep quality was much poorer the nights she imbibed. Once she received this prompt—her sleep score—she adjusted her behavior. When you highlight important data, the right choices become clearer. When it comes to changing behaviours, sometimes all it takes is one key piece of data. As they say, “Once you see it, you can’t un-see it.” (PN’s CEO Tim Jones used the feedback he got from various lifestyle trackers to finally reduce his genetically high cholesterol levels—and built a richer, more meaningful life in the process. Read more: How This Guy Cut His Cholesterol in Half Without Drugs ) When Jan, an avid recreational cyclist, found out he could view—then demolish—the records set on local biking trails, he set to work. But as those records were destroyed, so too was his ability to ride for enjoyment. His focus on speed left him under-recovered and eventually led to burnout. If workouts have become more about the numbers and less about technique, experience, or even enjoyment, tracking is likely no longer helpful. The harder you work, the better your results. Right? Not necessarily. This belief tends to get grinders like Zak into trouble because they think they’re making progress—but really they’re just getting in their own way, even inhibiting performance and recovery. Meanwhile, there are also many people who chronically under estimate their effort and capacity, and would benefit from turning up the heat. Here, data can help us more accurately understand our own potential. Let’s look at high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an example. HIIT workouts alternate fixed periods of intense effort with fixed periods of rest. However, these fixed periods of rest are just estimates of recovery times. Heart rate data can create a more individualized picture of actual recovery needs, which may be faster or slower than you expect. Sometimes, the mind says yes but the heart says not quite yet. A good coach does more than just simply ask for more . They also help keep clients out of the unproductive “junk volume” zone, where fatigue accumulates but performance doesn’t improve (and maybe even worsens). By looking at real-time metrics of output, fatigue, and recovery, you can better understand yourself and your clients, and help keep everyone training and recovering efficiently. When you become overly reliant on data, you risk losing touch with your own sense of how you feel, whether that’s hunger and fullness levels, energy and fatigue, or something else. A relevant example is “The Great My Fitness Pal Blackout.” In January of 2019, the calorie-tracking app (with a reported 200 million subscribers!) went down for a day. Pretty minor—unless you happened to be tracking your macro and caloric intake and waiting for the app to tell you exactly how much you could eat that day… which I was. When the app wouldn’t load, I recognized the mild panic I felt was unhelpful. My overreliance on the app had disconnected me from my own internal signals, and without it, I felt adrift. Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to how energetic I feel and one of the oldest tracking technologies available: the mirror. (If you feel like you’re lost without your besties—your phone and your apps—there’s a name for that. There are also ways to develop a healthier relationship with your tech. Read more: What is nomophobia? ) Before we get to how to do the above, let’s talk about why assessing things by feel can be so important. Whether it’s body fat percentage or movement speed, even supremely motivated and capable clients will experience diminishing objective results from their training. The scale stops dropping, the number of plates you’re able to load on the bar plateaus, or— gasp —your race time even regresses. Motivation based purely on progress or other extrinsic goals 6 will fall away during these times. However, exercisers who focus on feelings of mindfulness 7 , mastery, meaning 8 , and success 9 develop a more resilient practice. They also enjoy the process more, whether that’s the process of running, lifting, winding down for a good night’s sleep, or just enjoying a meal. So, although objective data can provide essential feedback and guidance, you’ll only reap the full benefits of your practice—that is, enjoyment and results—if you maintain connection with your felt experience. And good news: You can actually use fitness trackers to calibrate and even improve your ability to accurately sense what’s happening in your body. Here are three ways to do it. Can you imagine asking someone how their vacation was and then waiting for them to look at their photos to be able to answer? That’s what it’s like when you rely purely on external data about your own experience. Whatever the metric—how far you biked, how many calories you consumed, or how fast your heart was beating—the simplest way to work mindfully with tracker data is to pause, breathe, and then tune into the powerful (if not always accurate) prediction-making powers of your brain. Once you’ve checked in with yourself, you can calibrate your self-assessment by comparing the detailed (if not always accurate) outputs of your fitness tracker. Over time, you may be able to narrow the gap between two. (Note: Don’t forget to regularly update your app. Algorithms and data sets are regularly adjusted for better predictive accuracy.) The coaches I work with regularly ask people to estimate the boundaries of their strength (such as how many reps they can do at a given weight until failure). Novices are often terrible at estimating this—and regularly off the mark by five or more reps. However, the use of objective trackers can help calibrate their understanding, and most people can reduce their margin of error dramatically. In theory, you might use fancy tools like accelerometers or blood lactate measurements, but our coaches just ask, “For a million dollars a rep, how many more reps do you think you could do?” Though there’s nothing objective about this question, most clients are able to use the prompt as a kind of shortcut to understand maximal effort. (After all, that last rep may be worth seven figures!) The question also leverages the rate of perceived exertion (RPE)—your perception of how hard you’re working—which is one of the most validated sensory-driven approaches. Not everyone is automatically good at estimating RPE, but most people can improve their skills by mapping their felt experience with occasional calibration with objective data. Trackers have components like accelerometers, GPS, and gyroscopes to sense data about speed, distance, and more. But humans are no slouches either. We have… And that’s only a partial list. You have access to an incredibly rich network of sensory information—something that technology cannot begin to touch. All of this information is fed into the powerful pattern-recognition machine of your nervous system. To continue honing your ability to use this rich network of sensory information, regularly check in with what and how you’re feeling. When you learn to calibrate your own senses with objective data, you can leverage all the cool advances in wearable tech—while still keeping your own experience front and centre.

The general benefits are well-known and seem to work for a lot of people:\n\n* **Improved Sleep Quality:** This is the big one. It can help lower core body temperature and promotes a feeling of calm, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep without morning grogginess.\n* **Calming / Anxiolytic Effects:** It acts as a neurotransmitter, which can help take the edge off anxiety and stress during the day.\n* **Collagen & Connective Tissue Support:** It's a key component of collagen, so it’s great for skin, joint, and bone health.\n* **Glutathione Precursor:** It helps the body produce glutathione, a master antioxidant.\n\n**The Surprising (and Unofficial) Side Effect**\n\nHowever, while digging through forums and anecdotal reports online, I've come across a recurring theme: **a noticeable decrease in libido / sex drive.**\n\nI want to be clear, this is **not** a common side effect listed in major clinical studies, which makes it all the more interesting to discuss from a user-experience. To my knowledge, no study has specifically examined the **relationship** between glycine intake and libido\n\n**Diving into the 'Why': The Plausible Pathways**\n\nBefore just dismissing it,  there are actually a few plausible mechanisms that could explain why this might happen in some individuals:\n\n1. **Glycine as an Inhibitory Neurotransmitter:** This is the most likely explanation. Glycine's main job in the central nervous system is to be a \"brake pedal.\" It calms things down. Sexual arousal and libido, on the other hand, require strong \"gas pedal\" signals from excitatory neurotransmitters (like dopamine). It’s possible that by boosting the body's primary \"brake\" system, Glycine inadvertently dampens the excitatory signals needed for a strong libido in some people.\n2. **The Serotonin Connection:** Some research suggests that Glycine can influence and increase serotonin levels in the brain. As many people know from the side effects of SSRI antidepressants, elevated serotonin is very frequently linked to a decreased sex drive. If Glycine is nudging serotonin levels up, it could potentially be causing a similar, though likely much milder, effect.\n3. **Indirect Hormonal Influence (More Speculative):** Glycine can have some influence on the pituitary gland. Any significant shift in hormones like prolactin could theoretically impact libido, though the evidence for this pathway is much weaker than the first two.\n\n**So, I'm turning to the collective wisdom of this sub:**\n\nI'm curious to see if the anecdotal reports hold any weight in a larger group.\n\n* Has anyone else experienced a noticeable drop in libido while taking glycine?\n* If you did, what was your dosage and when did you take it (e.g., 3g before bed)?\n* Did the effect go away if you stopped or lowered the dose?\n* Conversely, has anyone noticed **no effect** or even a **positive** one on their libido, perhaps due to the benefits of better sleep and lower stress?\n\nGlycine is fantastic for sleep. However, some experienced a potential drop in libido. This could be biologically explained by Glycine's role as a primary \"brake\" (inhibitory) neurotransmitter in the body or its potential to increase serotonin. Wondering if anyone in the community can confirm or deny this from their own experience.", "relevance_score": 2.4, "relevance_hits": ["sleep"]}

The objective of the study is to develop a prognostic indicator for BCR using machine learning (ML) and motor protein-related genes (MPRGs).\n\nMETHODS: The prognosis relevance of the MPRGs in prostate cancer was analyzed by univariate Cox regression. Feature selection and model construction were performed using combinations of multiple machine learning algorithms. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and C-index. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the risk signature, and comparisons of BCR incidence, gene expression profiles, immune cell infiltration patterns, and drug sensitivity were conducted between these groups. The gene expression of MPRGs were validated in vitro.\n\nRESULTS: Among 120 MPRGs, 17 were differentially expressed, of which 8 were significantly associated with BCR. A novel risk scoring system using a StepCox[forward] + Ridge model based on these 8 MPRGs effectively stratified patients into two different risk groups, and patients with high riskscores had significantly higher BCR rates than those with lower riskscores. Enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation response, EMT, hypoxia, and estrogen response pathways in the high-risk category, while mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets were downregulated. The MPRG-derived risk score correlated positively with M2 macrophage infiltration and ngatively correlated with CD4 T cells and mast cells, and the high-risk category showed higher sensitivity to drugs like cisplatin and bicalutamide. The final nomogram based on MPRGs-derived signature and T stage provided an excellent tool for predicting BCR. In vitro experiments further validated that the expression trends of MPRGs in the risk signature were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study developed a novel MPRG-derived risk signature that effectively predicts BCR in prostate cancer, offering valuable insights for clinical management and personalized treatment strategies.", "relevance_score": 2.3686, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

This research aims to assess the expression of EDIL3 in PH and to investigate its underlying mechanisms in the condition. Our results indicated that EDIL3 levels are elevated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), as well as in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) compared to normoxia-treated controls. Additionally, a mouse model of PH induced by SU5416 along with hypoxia (Su/Hx) also expressed elevated EDIL3 levels. We discovered that EDIL3 knockdown diminished the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanically, we identified an interaction between EDIL3 and integrin αVβ3. The regulation of PASMCs proliferation by EDIL3 was disrupted by cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide that serves as a potent and selective inhibitor of integrin αVβ3. Furthermore, recombinant EDIL3 significantly increased the level of p-ERK1/2, an effect that was blocked by cilengitide, while p-p38 and p-JNK levels remained unchanged.

Previously, we generated a single-round infectious rotavirus by partially deleting the viral VP6 gene, and demonstrated its potential as a promising vaccine platform. However, this system has several limitations; namely, low viral protein expression levels and safety concerns. Here, we addressed these challenges by introducing large deletions into the VP7 or VP4 genes, which are dispensable for viral protein expression but essential for virion assembly. These VP7- or VP4-defective viruses exhibited markedly higher protein expression in wild-type MA104 cells than the previously developed VP6-defective virus. In addition, the large deletions reduce the risk of viral reversion, thereby increasing both efficacy and safety. In a mouse model, these viruses induced neutralizing antibodies at levels comparable with those elicited by wild-type rotavirus, indicating their potential as rotavirus vaccines. Moreover, a VP4-defective rotavirus harboring a heterologous gene achieved high expression of heterologous proteins, warranting its application as a viral vector vaccine. To further increase safety, we established a reverse genetics system for the bovine rotavirus WC3 strain, a parental strain of the licensed live attenuated rotavirus vaccine, and successfully generated a single-round VP4-defective rotavirus based on the WC3 backbone.

The results showed that the pre-dehydration process preserved some of the TGase activities (65.96 U/mg) but also some of the proteases and some metabolites (e.g. Histamine and Phosphatidylcholine) that are detrimental to the gelling process, and the gel strength of the obtained surimi gels was lower but acceptable than that of the washed surimi gels (390.97 g·cm and 464.51 g·cm).

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), commonly found in fermented foods, have taken on a dual role-as both passive encapsulation targets and active delivery carriers-forming a conceptual basis for the development of next-generation food delivery systems. This review examines the interactions between LAB and various food-grade encapsulation materials including proteins (such as whey protein, casein, zein), polysaccharides (like alginate, chitosan), and lipids (such as liposomes, W/O/W emulsions), highlighting roles of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, covalent cross-linking, and interfacial self-assembly. Moreover, four emerging LAB-based delivery systems are classified: (i) surface adsorption via non-covalent interactions, (ii) intracellular loading driven by membrane transport or biosynthesis, (iii) co-encapsulation in hydrogels and emulsions, as well as (iv) engineered LAB capable of in situ synthesis and targeted release. The review also summarizes practical applications in hydrocolloid-rich food systems, such as yogurt, plant-based gels, and functional beverages. These applications highlight LAB's contribution to enhancing structural stability, controlled release, and nutritional functionality. Finally, key challenges are discussed, including the limited compatibility between encapsulating materials and food matrices, insufficient understanding of the interactions between exopolysaccharides and interfaces, and the need for in vivo validation.

We integrated multi-omics data, including methylation QTL (mQTL), expression QTL (eQTL), and protein QTL (pQTL), alongside genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from FinnGen and the UK Biobank. SMR and colocalization analysis were employed to evaluate the causal relationship between mitochondrial-related genes and cholelithiasis. Potential therapeutic targets for cholelithiasis were further validated through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction networks (PPI), drug prediction, and molecular docking. Following integration of the multi-omics evidence, we identified 4 mitochondrial-related genes, categorized by evidence strength as: Tier 1 genes (supported by 2 omics and colocalization evidence): LIAS, HEBP1, PNKD; Tier 2 genes (supported by 2 omics): TARS2. PheWAS analysis indicated that these 4 genes were not associated with other traits. Biologically, these genes are closely related to metabolic processes. Molecular docking analysis showed high binding affinities for candidate drugs, including olmesartan and neostigmine bromide. By integrating multi-omics data, we have constructed the first causal chain of linking mitochondrial-related genes, metabolic pathways, and cholelithiasis. This study provides a theoretical foundation for personalized therapies targeting the genes LIAS, TARS2, HEBP1, and PNKD.", "relevance_score": 2.1621, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "strength"]}

For this, the study included 34 patients diagnosed with PPGLs. Pre-operative and postoperative serum samples were analyzed using 1D-proton NMR spectroscopy, and NMR spectral data were processed using Bruker software Topspin. The quantitative metabolic profiles were estimated using CHENOMX NMR-Suite, and multivariate data were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal PLS-DA followed by random forest (RF) classification method (a machine learning approach). The multivariate analysis revealed distinct metabolic differences between pre-operative and postoperative samples with respect to normal control (NC) samples, indicating a metabolic shift following tumor resection. RF classification, with an out-of-bag error rate of 0.186, effectively distinguished between NC, presurgery, and postsurgery groups, underscoring the distinct metabolic states in PPGL and the restorative effect of surgical intervention. Pre-operative serum profiles of PPGL patients were characterized by decreased levels of key metabolites, including glucose, citrate, amino acids (glutamine, glycine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, and alanine), histidine, myo-inositol, and creatinine, suggesting altered energy metabolism, and amino acid catabolism induced by catecholamine excess. Postsurgical profiles showed partial metabolic restoration, with significant increases in proline, glutamate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) (p < 0.01), indicating normalization involving lipid oxidation and amino acid metabolism. Although plasma metanephrines normalized postsurgery, full biochemical recovery lagged, as metabolic profiles of postoperative patients remained distinct from healthy controls. In conclusion, the present untargeted NMR metabolomics revealed significant metabolic reprogramming in PPGL patients and captured the partial normalization of metabolic pathways following tumor resection. Metabolites such as proline, glutamate, and 3-HB emerged as potential biomarkers of treatment response. These findings underscore the utility of metabolomics to identify biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, assessing postsurgical recovery, and improving our understanding of PPGL pathophysiology.", "relevance_score": 2.0685, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "leucine", "recovery"]}

Despite clinical and muscle pathology features highly suggestive of collagen VI-related dystrophy, some patients had remained without an identified causative variant in COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3. With combined muscle RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we uncovered a recurrent, de novo deep intronic variant in intron 11 of COL6A1 (c.930+189C>T) that leads to a dominantly acting in-frame pseudoexon insertion. We subsequently identified and have characterized an international cohort of 44 patients with this COL6A1 intron 11 causative variant, one of the most common recurrent causative variants in the collagen VI genes.

Partial amelioration of the disease phenotype in this individual provides a strong rationale for the development of our pseudoexon skipping therapy to successfully suppress the pseudoexon insertion, resulting in normal COL6A1 transcripts. We have previously shown that splice-modulating antisense oligomers applied in vitro effectively decreased the abundance of the mutant pseudoexon-containing COL6A1 transcripts to levels comparable to the in vivo scenario of the somatic mosaicism shown here, indicating that this therapeutic approach carries significant translational promise for ameliorating the severe form of UCMD caused by this common recurrent COL6A1 variant.", "relevance_score": 2.0419, "relevance_hits": ["collagen", "muscle"]}

The Olympia contender went on to note that while he doesn’t feel old at 31 years of age, he has noticed how his body responds to junk foods when compared to his younger days. “Not being in my 20s anymore, when I start eating like s**t, I feel it pretty f*****g hard,” revealed the 2025 New York Pro winner.  To combat his cravings, Walker now opts for healthier foods to make him feel full without the nasties. “Just give me some cream of rice, some fruit, and I’m good,” he explained. “I don’t need nothing else.”  A post shared by Nick \"the Mutant\" Walker (@nick_walker39)  In the video, Walker doubled down on his love of fruit, particularly the frozen kind. “I prefer for the majority of my fruits, except bananas sometimes, I prefer frozen fruit over fresh fruit,” he shared. When it comes to bananas, The Mutant’s reluctance to freeze them likely stems from the fact that bananas can brown, losing their structure and taste during the freezing process. Still, there’s a scientific reason that he likes to freeze the rest his fruit, and it’s not just about taste. “Studies have shown that frozen fruits are actually fresher than ‘fresh,’” said Walker. And, to a large extent, the big man is correct. Science has indeed shown that freezing fruit can have a positive effect on vitamin E content while preserving the same levels of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron found in fresh fruits. This is because the nutritional value of ‘fresh’ fruit will very much depend on a number of factors such as when the fruit was harvested. Keep your diet on the right path by stocking your fridge with these freezable produce. Fresh fruit that is transported or stored for longer periods of time can lose its value whilst frozen fruits have their nutrients locked in during peak ripeness. The vitamin C level degrades in fresh fruit over time as well. But, that’s not to say biting into a fresh, juicy apple, or enjoying that succulent banana should be ‘cancelled.’ There’s also a faux pas that you can make with choosing frozen fruits: To get the most from your frozen fruit, avoid pre-sweetened options or ‘blends’ that may add hidden sugars and syrups to your eating regime. For Walker, however, frozen is the way to go. “I will take frozen blueberries over fresh, any day of the week,” he concluded, and was met with a ton of support in his IG comments. “I absolutely agree,” wrote one follower. “Frozen fruits are better 95% of the time.” Perhaps the likeminded fan knocked 5% off because of some badly frozen bananas? Either way, The Mutant’s current progress has him looking seriously peeled! To follow Nick Walker on Instagram, click here. The 2024 Bigman Pro Spain winner is coming strong into the 2025 Olympia.

In this review, we discuss the pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and latest clinical evidence of the administration of sacubitril/valsartan in ESRD patients with heart failure.\n\nRESULTS: Sacubitril/valsartan contains sacubitril and valsartan that can regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and natriuretic peptides simultaneously. For ESRD patients with heart failure, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction, sacubitril/valsartan demonstrated potential benefits including improved ventricular remodeling, enhanced left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced mortality and heart failure re-hospitalization rates, while maintaining a favorable safety profile with no significant increased risk of hyperkalemia or hypotension. This review further discusses current challenges and future directions, including health economic evaluations and adverse event management strategies, to optimize clinical decision-making for the use of sacubitril/valsartan in this high-risk population.\n\nCONCLUSION: Sacubitril/valsartan may benefit ESRD patients with heart failure by improving ventricular remodeling and cardiac function while reducing mortality and hospitalization risks, without major safety concerns. However, larger studies are needed for confirmation.", "relevance_score": 1.8918, "relevance_hits": ["safety"]}

The aligned compared to the random constructs demonstrated an increased ability to synthesize total soluble proteins, including collagen type V, but collagen type I levels were reduced. This finding reveals a differential pattern for these proteins. Additionally, the collagen fibril diameters were larger in the aligned tissue constructs compared to the random constructs. Fibronectin and CHP colocalization patterns did not differ between groups; however, fibronectin and decorin were increased in the aligned group in contrast to tenascin C, which showed no difference.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the alignment of the healing microenvironment plays a crucial role in modulating the structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulates the synthesis of key proteins that are closely involved in fibrillogenesis and are indicative of the quality of the deposited ECM.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We developed a three-dimensional in vitro model that closely mimics in vivo conditions to investigate the role of corneal myofibroblasts in healing and regeneration.

Although neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes have been implicated, the roles of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in treatment-naïve RLS remain unclear.\n\nMETHODS: In this case-control study, 108 treatment-naïve RLS patients and 90 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Serum levels of GFAP, BDNF, and NfL were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Symptom severity and quality of life were assessed using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) and the RLS Quality of Life Questionnaire (QoL-RLS), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate biomarker associations with disease risk. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to assess the discriminative ability of serum GFAP, BDNF, and NfL levels in differentiating RLS patients from controls. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate diagnostic performance.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to controls, RLS patients had significantly higher serum levels of GFAP (148.27 ± 32.53 vs. 96.44 ± 27.81 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and NfL (15.35 ± 4.82 vs. 9.78 ± 3.59 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and lower levels of BDNF (18.71 ± 5.69 vs. 23.95 ± 6.12 pg/mL, p = 0.002). Multivariate analyses confirmed these markers as independent predictors of RLS (GFAP: OR = 1.592, BDNF: OR = 0.372, NfL: OR = 1.953, all p < 0.01). NfL was positively correlated with both IRLS (β = 0.531, p = 0.012) and QoL-RLS scores (β = 0.356, p = 0.007), while GFAP was associated with QoL impairment (β = 0.724, p < 0.001), and BDNF showed a negative association with symptom severity (β = -0.287, p = 0.003).

The protein 3C protease plays a crucial role as it blocks the virus replication. This study explores the potential of natural inhibitors, specifically Propolis compounds targeting the protein 3Cpro, which is a promising and less toxic alternative compared to the standard synthetic inhibitor, Rupintrivir.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A set of 60 propolis-derived molecules was selected and prepared for molecular docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinity to 3Cpro, then ligand-3Cpro protein interactions were visualized. A 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, then the following MD parameters were analyzed: RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonding. Binding free energies were further estimated using MM-PBSA, and per-residue energy decomposition was performed to identify key stabilizing interactions.\n\nRESULTS: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A displayed binding energies of -8.0 kcal/mol and -8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, outperforming the reference inhibitor Rupintrivir (-6.66 kcal/mol). MD simulations revealed that both ligands effectively stabilize 3Cpro, with RMSD scores of 1.02 ± 0.10 nm and 1,21 ± 0.22, respectively, and are also more stable in the pocket than Rupintrivir. These ligands also reduced RMSF, SASA, and Rg scores. MM-PBSA calculations showed more favorable binding energies for Rutin (-35.65 kcal/mol) and Retusapurpurin A (-31.59 kcal/mol) compared to Rupintrivir (-25.44 kcal/mol). Per-residue decomposition further revealed strong energetic contributions from catalytic site residues (His40, Glu71, and Cys147), especially in the Rutin complex.\n\nCONCLUSION: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A are promising inhibitors targeting 3Cpro, exhibiting elevated potential efficacy compared to Rupintrivir. These results pave the way for the development of natural antivirals derived from Propolis and support its use as a dietary supplement for the treatment of rhinovirus infections.

PS and falls are prevalent in aging populations, yet their combined impact on long-term stroke risk remains underexplored, particularly in Asian cohorts. This study investigates the association between fall history and incident stroke among middle-aged and older Chinese adults with PS.\n\nMETHODS: Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2015-2018), we analyzed 4605 participants with PS (mean age: 64.8 years). Fall history was assessed by self-reported response to \"Have you fallen in the past two years?\" Stroke was physician-diagnosed via self-report. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models evaluated stroke risk, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), and biomarkers (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed robustness.\n\nRESULTS: Stroke incidence was 9.3 % among fallers and 6.7 % among non-fallers, with a P-value of 0.036. Participants with fall history exhibited a 37 % higher risk of incident stroke compared to non-fallers (adjusted OR: 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.84). The association remained consistent across age, sex, BMI, and most comorbidity subgroups, except for dyslipidemia (interaction P = 0.022). Sensitivity analyses, including multiple imputation for missing data, exclusion of adults >80 years, and removal of hip fracture cases, consistently confirmed the robustness of the findings.\n\nCONCLUSION: Fall history independently predicts stroke risk in individuals with PS, highlighting the potential of fall prevention to reduce stroke burden in this population. This study provides novel evidence of a prolonged stroke risk trajectory in Asian PS cohorts, complementing Western studies focused on short-term post-fall risks. The study has several limitations.

Critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as aggregation, full/empty capsid ratios, viral protein composition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) must be monitored comprehensively. While several chromatographic techniques address individual CQAs, there is a growing industrial need for techniques that enable multi-attribute analysis in a single run.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography-ultraviolet detection-reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-UV-RPLC-MS) method for the comprehensive characterization of rAAV vectors. The method enables simultaneous assessment of high molecular weight species (aggregates), capsid identity, and PTMs. In the first dimension, SEC separates intact viral particles and quantifies aggregates, followed by a targeted heart-cut of the monomeric fraction. This fraction is then subjected to RPLC for protein separation under denaturing conditions, with high-resolution MS used to identify viral proteins and their modifications. Initially optimized for rAAV8, the method was successfully extended to other rAAV serotypes, demonstrating its adaptability across serotypes.

The data suggest that caffeine mitigates oxidative stress through alternative pathways, potentially involving enhanced mitochondrial function and antioxidative defenses.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential of caffeine as a protective agent for delaying motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Future studies should explore optimal dosing strategies, combinatorial treatment approaches, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, to enable translation of these findings to human ALS patients.", "relevance_score": 1.7691, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "performance", "protein", "strength"]}

FA primer was prepared by mixing ethyl acetate and ethanol as a binary solvent system at solvent ratios of 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, and 4:6. The optimal ratio of ethyl acetate to ethanol was determined by measuring the degree of conversion (DC) and contact angle, combining the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) and fracture pattern immediately and 10,000 thermocycles. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities and adhesive infiltration at the interface were observed, whereas scanning electron microscopy was used to further evaluate nanoleakage and resin rags.\n\nRESULTS: Application of the primer containing a mixed EAC:ET-4:6 solvent resulted in a significant enhancement in the µTBS of both immediate and aging groups, and the contact angle of the demineralized dentin surface. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were further observed the infiltration properties of resin rags in the bonding interface were strengthened.

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays. RIP and MeRIP assays were conducted to investigate the interaction between YTHDF1 and TOP2A mRNA. Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation. Additionally, YTHDF1 knockdown reduced TOP2A protein expression and mitigated hypoxia-induced PASMCs dysfunction, while TOP2A overexpression reversed these protective effects. Mechanistically, TOP2A activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, driving PASMCs proliferation and migration.

Transformation of the qualitative classification guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) into a quantitative Bayesian point system enables empirical validation of strength of evidence assigned to evidence criteria.

Furthermore, we defined exceptionally conserved ancestral residues (ECARs) and interrogated the performance of assays and tools at these residues in BRCA1. We found that missense substitutions in BRCA1 that fall at ECARs are disproportionately likely to be pathogenic with effect sizes similar to that of protein-truncating variants. In contrast, for substitutions falling at non-ECAR positions, concordant predictions of pathogenicity from functional assays and computational tools often fail to meet the additive assumptions of strength in ACMG guidelines.

Two recent elegant cryoEM structures of the DGC illuminate its molecular architecture and reveal the unique structural placement of sarcospan (SSPN) within the complex.

Molecular docking analysis identified ochratoxin A (- 9.1 kcal/mol), bromadiolone (- 8.6 kcal/mol), and permethrin (- 8.2 kcal/mol) as top-performing candidates, exhibiting strong binding affinities and stable molecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. These findings were reinforced by 100-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which showed sustained ligand-protein stability, particularly for ochratoxin A. Free energy estimations using the MM/PBSA method further suggested the thermodynamic favourability of these interactions. Pharmacokinetic profiling (ADMET) indicated favourable absorption and distribution properties for all three compounds, with low toxicity predictions, though some hepatotoxicity was noted. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that ochratoxin A and permethrin induced substantial alterations in protein dynamics, suggesting ligand-specific structural effects. Experimental validation confirmed the antibacterial activity of ochratoxin A against K. pneumoniae, producing a 34 ± 0.67 mm inhibition zone at 100 µg/disc, surpassing ciprofloxacin (33 mm) with a MIC of 18.33 ± 0.72 µg/mL and MBC of 39.33 ± 1.36 µg/mL (p < 0.05). Collectively, these in silico and in vitro results highlight fungal metabolites, particularly ochratoxin A, as promising therapeutic leads against MDR K. pneumoniae.

To address this need, we developed an innovative technique utilizing immobilized H2R for the rapid identification and characterization of bioactive compounds from complex matrices. Compared with the previous screening methods, this approach can detect the binding mode of ligands on the basis of screening. In this study, the prepared H2R chromatographic column was successfully applied for kinetic interaction analysis between two specific ligands and the receptor. The bioactive compound screened and collected via the H2R column was identified as liquiritin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-IT-MS). Competitive displacement assays revealed that liquiritin competes with nizatidine and ranitidine for the same binding sites. Notably, as the concentration of famotidine in the mobile phase increased, an inverse shift in the retention time of liquiritin was observed. To elucidate this phenomenon, molecular docking simulations were performed. The results suggest that nizatidine and ranitidine compete with liquiritin for the same binding sites, reducing liquiritin-protein binding and increasing the proportion of free liquiritin, thereby causing a forward shift in the retention peak. In contrast, the acidic residues (ASP186, ASP98) of famotidine may reorganize the protein's surface charge through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, altering the electrostatic interactions of liquiritin and leading to the observed peak shift. Additionally, at higher concentrations, famotidine may form multimolecular complexes that indirectly stabilize liquiritin-protein binding. Literature review revealed that, compared to nizatidine and ranitidine, famotidine exhibits a positive regulatory effect on β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization. These findings further demonstrate that the established H2R receptor chromatography model can effectively screen bioactive components and determine their binding modes. This study lays the foundation for screening bioactive compounds from traditional Chinese medicines using receptor chromatography and provides preliminary insights into their mechanisms of action.", "relevance_score": 1.6482, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

Using the Ancestral and BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 strains as model systems, we developed the Q-NAb IgG Test for the quantitative determination of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants, traceable to WHO International Standards. The test utilizes a novel Fusion Protein that mimics the Spike receptor binding domain docked to the human ACE2 protein and effectively blocks non-neutralizing antibodies in the sample.

Prior studies yielded heterogeneous results, ranging from decreased to increased intestinal permeability in AN. This study aimed to assess intestinal permeability in adolescent patients with AN by comparing serum markers Zonulin, Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and intestinal Fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) with healthy controls (HC) over time.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study on 60 female adolescent patients with AN and 36 age-matched HC. Blood samples were collected at admission to inpatient treatment, at discharge, and at a one-year follow-up. Zonulin, LBP, iFABP and inflammation marker Interleukin 6 levels were measured alongside clinical parameters. Linear mixed models were applied to assess group differences and longitudinal changes. Pearson correlations were used to explore clinical associations.\n\nRESULTS: Zonulin levels were significantly decreased in the AN group at admission and again at the follow-up compared to HC. LBP levels were consistently reduced in AN across all three time points. These alterations thus persisted despite weight recovery. No significant differences were observed in iFABP levels between the groups or over time. Zonulin and LBP positively correlated with Interleukin 6, linking gut permeability to inflammatory processes.\n\nCONCLUSION: Decreased Zonulin and LBP levels suggest reduced paracellular intestinal permeability in adolescent AN while transcellular permeability (iFABP) appears to be rather unaffected. The persistence of these alterations despite weight recovery suggests that reduced intestinal permeability may be a trait rather than a state marker in AN.

However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s). The DG-PSM promotes the realization of plasma separation and detection on lab-on-a-chip.

Body composition was measured using the InBody770 multi-frequency body composition analyzer. Plasma TMAO concentrations were assessed by ELISA. Cross-sectional analysis was performed after collecting demographic data, dialysis-related data, laboratory parameters, and body composition data from MHD patients.\n\nRESULTS: In MHD patients, the PEW group exhibited lower levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), transferrin (TF), creatinine (Cr), triglycerides (TG), prealbumin (PALB), soft lean mass (SLM), body mass index (BMI), percent of body fat (PBF), arm muscle circumference (AMC), and phase angle (PHA) compared to the non-PEW group, while C-reactive protein (CRP) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels, as well as Extracellular Water/Total Body Water (ECW/TBW) ratio, were higher in the PEW group than in the non-PEW group. After full adjustment, TMAO and ECW/TBW ratio were independent risk factors for PEW in MHD patients. Further, plasma TMAO levels correlated negatively with Cr, ALB, Hb, BMI, and PHA, and positively with ECW/TBW in MHD patients with PEW. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma TMAO in predicting PEW in MHD patients was 0.788.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma TMAO levels and certain body composition are associated with the occurrence of PEW in MHD patients.

In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9).

Increasing evidence implicates neurotransmission deficits in the pathophysiology of SMA. In particular, alterations in neuroactive amino acids involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission have recently been identified in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMApatients and the spinal cord of SMNΔ7 mouse models. L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, plays a critical role in glutamatergic receptor signalling, influencing neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. However, it remains unclear whether SMN deficiency affects L-arginine metabolism in SMA. To address this, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to investigate whether SMN deficiency alters L-arginine homeostasis in the central nervous system of SMNΔ7 mice and in the CSF of SMA patients with varying disease severity, both before and after treatment with the SMN-inducing therapy Nusinersen. Notably, we observed significantly reduced L-arginine levels in the brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic SMA mice compared to age-matched wild-type littermates. Consistent with these findings, we revealed lower L-arginine levels in severe SMA1 patients compared to milder SMA2 and SMA3 patients and healthy controls, enhancing the translational strength of our findings. Importantly, Nusinersen-mediated SMN upregulation fully restored L-arginine homeostasis in the CSF of severe SMA1 patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a dysregulation of L-arginine in SMA and highlight a role for SMN-enhancing therapies in restoring neurochemical alterations observed in patients with this neurodegenerative disease.", "relevance_score": 1.3897, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "performance", "protein", "strength"]}

Reticulocalbin-1 (RCN1), located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is associated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many solid tumors, but its role in ccRCC has not been analyzed before.\n\nMETHODS: In this study, we performed in-silico transcriptomic data mining to analyze RCN1 expression at mRNA and protein levels using large publicly available databases and conducted the first large-scale cohort study on the impact of RCN1 in ccRCC, including data from 306 patients who underwent tumor resection at the Clinic of Urology, University Hospital Bonn. We examined the correlation of RCN1 expression with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival. Additionally, we analyzed the association of RCN1 expression with CD8 T-lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. In vitro functional analysis was performed by silencing RCN1 using siRNA in Caki-1 and A498 cell lines to determine its role in tumor cell behavior.\n\nRESULTS: RCN1 is highly expressed in ccRCC at both the mRNA and protein levels in public databases, which was confirmed by our cohort data, where RCN1 was found to be highly and homogenously expressed in 63.7% of ccRCCs. High RCN1 expression was associated with shorter overall survival both at the mRNA (p < 0.001) and protein levels (p = 0.01). Furthermore, high RCN1 expression was correlated with higher tumor grade (p = 0.002), tumor stage (p = 0.036), presence of lymph node metastases (p = 0.004), and distant metastases (p = 0.017). Clusters of macrophages tended to correlate with RCN1 expression (p = 0.051), but no significant correlation was found between RCN1 expression and the amount of CD8 T-lymphocytes. Additionally, silencing RCN1 led to a significant reduction in tumor cell migration and invasion.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results confirm that RCN1 is highly and homogenously expressed in ccRCC and correlates with poor prognosis and unfavorable clinicopathological parameters.

Recent deep learning-based DTI predictions have demonstrated promising performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) The over-reliance on the extraction of local features and insufficient learning of global features limit the model's performance. (ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human.

Parasite invasion and egress cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells, which is mediated by a variety of secretory proteins from several unique organelles, such as micronemes. Previous spatial proteomic analysis has identified insulinase-like protease 6 (INS6) as a putative microneme protein in C. parvum. However, the functional contribution of INS6 to Cryptosporidium pathogenicity remains poorly characterized. In this study, we used genetic manipulation techniques to investigate the expression and biological functions of INS6 in C. parvum.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The INS6 gene was tagged and deleted in C. parvum using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The expression of INS6 was determined by immunofluorescence analysis, ultrastructure-expansion microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. Endogenous labelling showed low levels of INS6 expression, which is found in C. parvum micronemes and is absent during the male gamont stage. The effect of INS6 deletion on parasite growth and pathogenicity was assessed in vitro using HCT-8 cultures and in vivo by infection of interferon-γ knockout mice. Deletion of the INS6 gene impaired C. parvum proliferation in vitro and significantly reduced the parasite burden in infected mice. In addition, mice infected with the Δins6 strain showed a significant reduction in the intestinal villus-to-crypt ratio, attenuated body weight loss and increased survival rates, compared to those infected with the INS6-3HA strain.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that INS6 protein is involved in C. parvum proliferation and plays a critical role in modulating the pathogenicity of this zoonotic parasite.

He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28.

Protein Spalmitoylation, the reversible attachment of palmitate to cysteine residues, converts excess palmitoylCoA into broad alterations in signalling and membrane dynamics.

This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases.

Potential miRNAs and functional genes regulating diagnostic genes were predicted utilizing Network Analyst and GeneMANIA platforms.\n\nRESULTS: We identified HMGB2 and PRPF19 as diagnostic markers for IPF, both of which exhibited excellent diagnostic performance across three datasets. Comparisons at both single-cell and transcriptome levels revealed that HMGB2 was overexpressed in IPF, while PRPF19 was underexpressed. Immune microenvironment assessments indicated high infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in IPF group, suggesting presence of an inflammatory fibrotic immune microenvironment. Correlation analysis showed that various immune cells in IPF immune microenvironment were significantly associated with HMGB2 and PRPF19, indicating that these genes may influence immune microenvironment.\n\nCONCLUSION: By combining WGCNA and LASSO analyses, this study identified two hub genes, HMGB2 and PRPF19, that can serve as diagnostic markers for IPF and modulate its immune microenvironment.

Herein, we present a one-pot strategy named miR-nSTEV for specific recognition and in situ miRNA profiling of TEV at the single-particle level for precise prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. Utilizing dual-surface protein recognition (CD63 and EpCAM) and orthogonal DNA barcoding-based fusion between the identified TEV and DNA-tagged liposome encapsulating variant miRNA probes (Tag-Lipo probes), our approach enables selective isolation and precise miRNA analysis of individual TEVs by nanoflow cytometry (nFCM). By integrating dual-protein sorting, DNA-directed fusion, and nFCM detection into one platform, miR-nSTEV effectively eliminates interference from free nucleic acids and RNases, significantly enhancing the detection fidelity. As a proof of concept, we profiled six PCa-associated miRNAs (miR-153, miR-183, miR-18A, miR-181, miR-429, and miR-940) in both cell culture medium and clinical plasma samples. The miR-nSTEV assay demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, achieving 100% accuracy in distinguishing PCa patients from healthy donors (HD), outperforming conventional RT-qPCR while simplifying the workflow.

Herein, we report the rational chemical design and synthesis of a dithiolane-incorporated lipidoid (S-DOPE) to construct an innovative LNP formulation, termed SLNP, for enhanced intracellular mRNA delivery. These chemically engineered SLNPs exploit an inherent thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, whereby the unique dithiolane moiety triggers a dynamic covalent disulfide-thiol exchange reaction with cell surface thiols. This chemically driven reaction facilitates direct cytosolic mRNA delivery, effectively bypassing endosomal entrapment, a major bottleneck for conventional LNPs. In vitro studies demonstrate that SLNP formulations achieve an 11-fold increase in mRNA transfection and translation efficiency compared to standard LNPs. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations reveal a 4.5-fold enhancement in mRNA expression and robust immune responses. SLNP-mediated vaccination at low doses elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response. Notably, SLNPs induce neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are comparable to those achieved with significantly higher doses of conventional LNPs, highlighting their substantial dose-sparing potential.
