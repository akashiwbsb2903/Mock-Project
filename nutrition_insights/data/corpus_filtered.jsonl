But is it all hype? The most recent research suggests collagen may not live up to the claims that permeate the fitness world . Dr. Layne Norton , Ph.D. in Nutritional Sciences, doubts collagen’s value. Collagen supplementation looks like a scam. I am skeptical. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, helping make up the skin, bones, tendons, ligaments , and cartilage. There are at least 16 types, but types I, II, and III are closely tied to fitness and joint /skin health. There are four main ways collagen works in the body: Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you?

Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. To separate fact from marketing, a 2023 randomized controlled trial from Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise examined how collagen supplementation affects muscle connective tissue protein synthesis after exercise. The findings showed that collagen ingestion during recovery did not increase connective tissue protein synthesis , suggesting that it may not enhance muscle and tendon repair the way some supplements claim. ( 1 ) A post shared by Jeremy L. Buendia (@jeremy_buendia) If muscle and connective tissue don’t benefit, what about skin? New evidence indicates collagen might not help skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles. A 2025 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials, including 1,474 participants, found improvements only in pharma-funded studies. In contrast, research not funded by pharmaceutical companies reported no significant benefits. ( 2 ) Excluding outlier studies, collagen supplements showed no significant improvements in wrinkles, hydration, or elasticity. Swapping collagen for whey protein might be the right move for strength, vitality, and muscle building . Whey protein consistently outperforms collagen in head-to-head comparisons for hypertrophy . ( 3 ) Research has shown no significant differences between whey and collagen for stimulating connective tissue synthesis, making collagen the inferior option for those seeking muscle growth or recovery benefits. ( 4 ) ( 5 ) “Collagen literally has the worst amino acid profile of any protein source on the market,” Dr. Norton asserted. “It is absurdly low in essential amino acids, specifically the branch chain amino acids and leucine, which stimulate muscle protein synthesis.” Everyone wants an edge in training, but high-quality research shows collagen’s effects on muscle and connective tissue are inconsistent. Its real-world impact on muscle growth, recovery, and skin health appears limited, leaving its effectiveness debatable.

This study explored the impact of varying screw speeds (150 rpm and 550 rpm), which directly influence specific mechanical energy (SME) input during extrusion, on protein molecular weight distribution, cooking properties, and starch and protein digestibility in both regular durum wheat pasta and gluten-enriched pasta. Pasta produced at 550 rpm exhibited reduced water absorption and cooking time but significantly increased cooking loss, accompanied by a decrease in disulphide bonds. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results indicated that high screw speed caused the insolubility of glutenins and globulins while increasing the solubility of gliadins. Additionally, these structural changes corresponded to decreased ionic and hydrogen bonding and increased hydrophobic interactions. Although starch and protein enzymic digestibility was decreased with added gluten, the increased screw speed enhanced their digestion. Proteomic mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS analysis) revealed a reduction in the number of identified proteins and allergens in the digestate of pasta produced at 550 rpm, while the number of identified peptides increased. Additionally, added gluten delayed protein hydrolysis during the gastric phase and offset differences due to screw speed.

This concept is likened to a \"cake,\" with specific timing of protein intake being merely \"a very thin layer of icing\" on that cake.\n\nThere’s a clear hierarchy where meeting your total daily protein needs takes precedence over everything else. This means that even if protein intake is not perfectly distributed across meals, for instance, a smaller amount in the morning and a much larger, protein-rich dinner, the body can still effectively utilise that protein for muscle building, provided the daily total is met. Don’t think you need to front-load 50% of your protein requirement immediately after your workout.\n\n# Optimal Daily Protein Intake for Muscle Building\n\nFor most individuals aiming to build muscle through resistance training, the recommended total daily protein intake is approximately **1.6 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight**, which translates to about **0.7 grams per pound of body weight**. Some recommendations suggest going up to 2 grams per kilogram, or roughly 1 gram per pound, but these don’t factor in lean muscle mass, so are likely higher than necessary. A meta-analysis of existing literature concluded that as long as total daily protein intake was at or above this range, **the specific timing of protein consumption relative to a workout did not significantly impact muscle gain**.\n\n# The \"Anabolic Window\" is Very Flexible\n\nThe traditional notion of a narrow \"anabolic window,\" which suggested consuming protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, largely originated from studies where subjects trained in a completely fasted state. However, this concept has limited relevance for most people who consume meals before their workouts. When a mixed meal is eaten pre-exercise, its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects can last anywhere from three to six hours, meaning that **nutrients are often still circulating in the bloodstream during and even after a training session**.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis found that if the total daily protein intake is sufficient, the **exact timing of protein relative to the training session makes no meaningful difference** for muscle gain. Furthermore, the actual physiological \"anabolic window\" for muscle protein synthesis is much broader than just a few hours; it **peaks approximately 24 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for as long as 48 to 72 hours**. This indicates that the body has an extended period to utilise available nutrients for muscle repair and growth.\n\n# Meal Timing and Protein Portion Sizes\n\nResearch demonstrates considerable flexibility in when and how much protein one consumes per meal. A study showed **no significant advantage** between consuming protein immediately before exercise versus immediately after. Building on this, another trial specifically examined what happens when individuals neglect all nutrients for three hours both before and after a resistance training bout, while still optimising total daily protein. The results showed **no significant or meaningful difference in muscle size and strength gains** compared to a group that consumed protein immediately around their workout. This means there is **tremendous flexibility** in fitting protein intake into a busy schedule. While studies suggest that doses of around **30 to 50 grams per meal (or 0.4 to 0.6 grams per kilogram of body weight / 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound of body weight)** appear to maximize muscle protein synthesis *per meal*, the body is also perfectly capable of effectively utilizing much larger protein amounts, such as **75 to 100 grams, from a single meal** for muscle protein synthesis. This is particularly helpful for individuals who find it more practical to consume a significant portion of their daily protein in one or two larger meals, such as dinner.\n\n# Nutrient Availability Trumps Ingestion Time\n\nThe crucial element for muscle protein synthesis is the **presence of nutrients in circulation**, not the precise moment those nutrients are ingested relative to your workout. Nutrients typically **peak in the bloodstream one to two hours after consumption**. Therefore, if you eat protein before a workout, those amino acids will become available in your system during or shortly after your training, ready for use by your muscles. This clarifies why a rush for immediate post-workout protein is often unnecessary, especially if a pre-workout meal has been consumed.\n\n\\---\n\nTaken from r / healthchallenges", "relevance_score": 10.0, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein", "recovery"]}

Quercetin and caffeic promoted nearly iron release at all polyphenol-to-complex levels studied (0.5:1 to 3:1), whereas gallic acid only promoted iron release at higher ratios (3:1). Polyphenol retention after digestion was relatively low (1 %-7 %), except for caffeic acid (21.5 % at 3:1).

Due to lack of antiviral agents and significant adverse effects and less affordability of vaccines, the E-protein targeted drug development is gaining critical attention among the researchers. The present review explores the structural and genomic diversities of E-protein among animal viruses with special interest to flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses. E-protein's viroporin activity damages host cell membrane and induces inflammation that advances the disease progression. The review also explains the viroporin-mediated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs)-linked cellular mechanisms in virus-mediated inflammation. The E-protein is considered an alternative promising antiviral target as its functional domain is conserved. This review further enlists the natural, and synthetic inhibitors of E-protein in the development of antiviral agents based on computational, in vitro, and in vivo studies. The E-protein's universal conservation ability to fasten to cellular membranes and limited structural data imparts significant challenge to selective drug inhibition. The present review highlights that the E-protein together with multiple viral factors will boost treatment performance while minimising viral resistance. In addition, broad-range inhibitors targeting E-proteins have the potential to produce single treatment solutions in combating viral infections including several viral strains. In conclusion, E-protein targeted drug would be beneficial in developing potential antiviral agents with high drug specificity, and less viral resistance.", "relevance_score": 9.5627, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

Currently, there is still a lack of relevant treatments. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a vital tool for identifying druggable targets in skeletal muscle to develop T2DM treatments.\n\nMETHODS: Potential causative genetic factors in skeletal muscle and blood causally associated with T2DM were identified by SMR analysis. Bayesian colocalisation were used to validate causality. Pleiotropic impact of drug targets was assessed using phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR). Then, targeted overexpression or knockdown of AEBP1 in mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12) and human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) further validated the functional phenotype. Protein docking, co-IP and SPR were used to demonstrate protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Both European and Asian populations revealed that AEBP1 was significantly associated with T2DM and its glycemic profile in blood and skeletal muscle, and was identified as a risk factor. Co-localisation analyses suggest that AEBP1 and T2DM originate from the same genetic variants. Meanwhile, targeted AEBP1 therapy has no potential adverse effects. Furthermore, AEBP1 was significantly expressed in in vivo and in vitro IR models and was consistent with the SMR results. Overexpression of AEBP1 further impaired insulin signalling and glucose transport mechanisms, exacerbating skeletal muscle IR. Targeting AEBP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Protein interaction experiments revealed that PI3K (p110β) is a direct target protein for AEBP1 to exert molecular functions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeting AEBP1 therapy is expected to be a pivotal approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.", "relevance_score": 9.5169, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein"]}

While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the \"black box\" nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding.", "relevance_score": 9.5125, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "quality"]}

However， conventional methods such as immunofixation electrophoresis （IFE） and western blotting （WB） suffer from complex workflows， time-consuming operations， and limited quantification capabilities owing to intricate staining and de-staining procedures. In addition， these traditional immunological detection methods require extensive manual handling and specialized expertise， while low levels of automation restrict their applicability to high-throughput or large-scale analysis scenarios. Moreover， the multistep nature of these methods increases the risk of experimental errors and compromises quantification accuracy.Herein， we present a quantitative protein immune polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis （PAGE） detection method that combines immune-recognition principles with online fluorescence imaging technology， thereby offering a rapid and specific approach for quantifying target proteins. The developed method exploits the specificity of fluorescently labeled antibodies and the separation capability of PAGE， with formaldehyde crosslinking used to stabilize antigen-antibody complexes under the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis， thereby ensuring reliable quantification. The entire experimental workflow can be completed within 1.5 h and consists of three main steps. Firstly， the target protein is incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies at room temperature for 0.5 h to form immune complexes， after which they are crosslinked using formaldehyde. The cross-linked samples are then loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and separated under optimized electrophoresis conditions （120 V， 15 min； 150 V， 15 min； 200 V， 15 min）. Electrophoretic separation is finally monitored in real-time using an online fluorescence imaging system， which enables direct visualization of protein migration and eliminates the need for post-separation processing. Three distinct bands are observed on the precast gel following immune PAGE separation： the immune complexes at the uppermost position， the free fluorescent antibodies in the middle， and other proteins at the bottom. ImageJ software is used to analyze the electrophoresis pattern， and quantification is achieved based on the linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the free antibody and the mass concentration of the target protein. We systematically validated the performance of the method using human transferrin （TRF） as the model antigen protein and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled （FITC-labeled） anti-TRF IgG antibody （anti-TRF IgG-FITC） as the detection probe， which involved analyzing three key aspects： the necessity of the formaldehyde-crosslinking step for maintaining immune complex stability， antibody recognition specificity in complex samples， and the linear correlation between the fluorescence signal and the mass concentration of the target protein. The method exhibited excellent analytical performance， with a linear range that extended between 5.0 and 200.0 mg/L and a correlation coefficient （", "relevance_score": 8.6156, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

The primary hypothesis of this study was that oxidative damage, caused in vivo by oxidative stress-a key factor in aging and various inflammatory diseases-deteriorates bone tissue quality by damaging bone collagen, the main component of the bone's organic phase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038). The hypothesis that physiological levels of oxidative damage generated in vitro degrade cortical bone mechanical properties by damaging the bone collagen has been confirmed. This suggests that oxidative damage of bone collagen is important towards understanding the degradation of bone quality in aging and various diseases.", "relevance_score": 8.5676, "relevance_hits": ["collagen", "protein", "quality", "strength"]}

The intensity of the inflammatory response appears as the principal driver of the changes involved in outcome, and especially those affecting protein metabolism and muscle catabolism, and resistance to nutrition. The present exploratory study aims to clarify the role of the different cytokines in amino acid metabolism.\n\nMETHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of the previously published observational study, including 51 critically ill patients and 49 healthy controls aiming at identifying patient changes in amino acid metabolism, we assessed the association between a panel of cytokines and blood levels of amino acids (AA) and their turnover. The subjects were matched for age, sex, and BMI. The study was conducted in postabsorptive state. Blood analysis included cytokines (determined by Luminex), C-reactive protein (CRP or hsCRP), and AA.\n\nPROTOCOL: 8 mL solution containing 18 stable AA tracers administered as a pulse to calculate amino acid whole body production (WBP).

Indeed, if you are focused on supporting muscle recovery and growth after hitting the gym, feeling less peckish following a meal, [&#8230;]\n\nNever before have we had a bigger appetite for protein. Everyone seems to be waxing poetic about this macronutrient as it’s being hyped as the means to packing on more muscle and slashing hunger. Indeed, if you are focused on supporting muscle recovery and growth after hitting the gym, feeling less peckish following a meal, maintaining bones of steel, and keeping your immune system firing on all cylinders, then eating enough protein is crucial. So it’s a good thing that more people are becoming aware of their protein needs. This has left consumers on the hunt for easy ways to get more protein in their diet. And food and beverage manufacturers have taken notice. While protein bars and shakes are still out there in spades, more and more brands are adding protein to many unsuspecting foods. Protein-packed spaghetti and high-protein everything bagels. Chocolate chip cookies with as much protein as a trio of eggs. Watermelon flavored protein gels. Vanilla glazed donuts with 20 grams of protein. Fruity-tasting protein soda. Yes, we are in a golden era of protein-enhanced food. I won’t be surprised if I get a pitch sometime soon for a protein crusted frozen fish fillet or protein-enhanced carrot sticks. It’s never been easier to eat heaps of protein.  Despite all the hoopla, we need to proceed with caution when it comes to the crazy world of protein-rich, on-the-go foods. Not all foods and drinks boosted with protein are what you should be eating. Here’s what you need to know about the products beefed up with protein and how to figure out if you should go all-in. Spoiler alert: Foods that are naturally high in protein without a helping hand from food producers are still the best muscle-makers money can buy. Yes, these protein-enhanced foods make it easier to get the necessary amount of this muscle-making macro, but that doesn’t mean you have to pay up for them. As a general rule, active people who are keen on building lean body mass should aim to take in 1.6 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That is 130 to 163 grams of protein for a 180 pound guy. So, yes, that is a sizable amount of protein you need to stuff in every day to hone your physique. But certainly not impossible if you make sure to eat sufficient amounts of protein-dense foods like chicken, eggs, fish, tofu, and Greek yogurt at your meals and snacks. And perhaps a scoop or two of protein powder into your shakes. If you do this, then the need for expensive protein-boosted foods is less pressing. After all, before all these products hit the market somehow we got by without suffering the perils of protein deficiency. Arnold did not have access to bread with 8g of protein in a slice. The upshot is that you should try to accurately calculate your daily protein intake and then use this information to better understand your need, or not, for foods that are jacked up with extra protein. Perhaps protein chips and steak aren’t created equal. A recent analysis of a lofty 1,641 protein bars published in the journal Scientific Reports found that the quality of protein in most bars on the market is far from ideal for building muscle. For the study, researchers analyzed the protein content, source, and nutritional quality of numerous widely available protein bars. Although 81% of the protein bars analyzed were considered high in protein from sources like whey and soy, when the protein sources were processed into bar form, digestibility typically dropped significantly. The study authors surmise that the low numbers can be attributed to the use of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibers that may deteriorate the bioaccessibility of essential amino acids. So 20 grams of protein from a bar may not be equivalent to the same amount of the macro from a hunk of chicken. Another reason to focus on eating mostly whole food sources of protein. Certainly, research like this should make us question the protein quality of certain processed foods like bars. For good reason, we have associated protein with health, but this is certainly not always the case. Just because a product as amped up their protein does not make it a nutritional hero. Never forget that protein can be just one aspect of a food. If a protein-fortified food or beverage is also laced with added artificial sweeteners, sugars, refined grains, abundant fat calories, emulsifiers, salt, and an assortment of tongue-twisting additives then you have to start questioning whether that extra protein is worth the overall nutrition cost. For instance, I’ve come across some high-protein cereals that have more grams of added sugars than grams of protein. Protein pretzels with plenty of refined grains and sodium can still be considered ultra-processed, despite giving you way more protein than your standard ballpark option. Do your due diligence and read package labels carefully to make sure all that protein doesn’t come with too much nutritional baggage. Not all foods advertised as being a protein heavyweight are true to their marketing. It’s easy to find so-called protein bars, protein granola, and protein candy that don’t deliver much more than the normal option. Protein has become a marketing term and some brands are leaning heavily on this without delivering the goods. Don’t believe the front-of-the-package hype until you determine for yourself how much protein the product has. There is no regulated amount of protein that a product has to contain before saying it is ‘high-protein’, but sage advice is that a protein-fortified food or drink should give you at least 8 to 10 grams in a serving. These protein-enhanced foods don’t sacrifice nutrition to go bigger on the muscle-sculpting macro. Nutrition (1 pouch): 340 calories, 10g fat, 49g carbs, 11g fiber, 20g protein, 240mg sodium This no-cooking-required overnight muesli-oatmeal hybrid is a nutritional giant. Each pouch of oats, which you only need to dump into a jar or bowl and soak in milk for a few hours, has an impressive 20 grams of plant-based protein and 11g of dietary fiber from sources like chia seeds. There is even some probiotics in the fold to give your gut a boost. Plus, the product is low in added sugar, letting the dried fruit carry most of the sweetness. And the chocolate flavor makes it a crave-worthy breakfast. The great balance of carbs and protein makes this a good option for post-gym recovery nutrition. Oikos Pro Plain Nutrition (3/4 cup): 160 calories, 3.5g fat, 6g carbs, 0g fiber, 25g protein, 60mg sodium The inclusion of whey protein gives this yogurt even more of the macro than most Greek versions on the market. Plus, it’s deliciously thick without including any thickening agents and delivers just the right amount of tang. The plain flavor means there are no added sugars. Unbun Protein Seeded Bread Nutrition (2 slices): 160 calories, 4.5g fat, 22g carbs, 19g fiber, 22g protein, 430mg sodium This isn’t your standard slice of doughy white sandwich bread. The bread is made with milk protein isolate and whey protein concentrate to help turn your lunch sandwiches and morning toast into a protein powerhouse. There are no refined grains or added sugar, a rarity in the commercial bread industry. And the fiber levels are off-the-charts. Just something to keep in mind if your gut isn’t used to eating high-fiber foods. If this is the case, you may want to ease into the product by starting with a single slice at a time. Felicia Red Lentil Penne Nutrition (3.5 oz): 340 calories, 1.5g fat, 65g carbs, 12g fiber, 26g protein, 0mg sodium This shaped pasta is made with organic red lentil flour instead of wheat flour giving, it a serious protein and fiber advantage. And this dynamic duo makes the noodles extra satiating. When prepared as instructed, the texture doesn’t suffer. Consider this your path to next-level pasta salad.

Vascular and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are thought to contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes, a key vascular cell type, may play a key role. In model organisms, sleep disruption is associated with pericyte dysfunction and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Recent advances in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) technology have identified two transcriptionally distinct subtypes of pericytes: extracellular matrix protein-expressing M-pericytes and solute carrier-expressing T-pericytes. However, the relationship between sleep, pericyte biology and cognition in humans remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that differences in the composition of brain pericyte subpopulations, as inferred from marker gene expression, may link sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline. We leveraged two published human brain snRNAseq datasets to identify specific marker genes for M- and T-type pericytes. We then used post-mortem bulk RNAseq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 1092) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (n = 495) to quantify expression of these marker genes in older adults in two longitudinal cohort studies: the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. We derived trajectories of global cognitive function from participants' ante-mortem annual cognitive assessments, while sleep fragmentation was derived from ante-mortem wrist-actigraphy recordings from a subset of 572 participants. We used multivariate linear regression to relate pericyte marker gene expression to sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline in the decade preceding death. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, greater average sleep fragmentation was associated with greater expression of M-pericyte marker genes [estimate = +3.65 × 10-1, standard error (SE) = 1.61 × 10-1, P = 0.024] but not T-pericyte marker genes. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression of M-pericyte (estimate = -8.30 × 10-3, SE = 3.37 × 10-3, P = 0.014) but not T-pericyte marker genes was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in the 10 years prior to death. In the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, greater sleep fragmentation was also associated with greater composite M-pericyte gene expression (estimate = + 4.48 × 10-1, SE = 1.92 × 10-1, P = 0.02), which in turn was associated with faster cognitive decline in the decade preceding death (estimate = -1.30 × 10-2, SE = 4.55 × 10-3, P = 0.0044).

It has been confirmed that Klotho serves as a critical protective factor across multiple biological systems, with its roles in neuroprotection, cardiovascular health, and renal function being particularly noteworthy. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of Klotho protein against oxidative and nitrosative stress in heart IRI through regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway. The study utilised in vitro human cardiomyocyte culture and ex vivo isolated rat hearts subjected to IRI. Recombinant Klotho protein was administered to evaluate its effects on heart mechanical function, gene and protein expression of NOS isoforms, oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, MMP activity, and lipid metabolism. Administration of Klotho significantly improved heart mechanical and contractile function following ischemia/reperfusion. Klotho normalised the expression and synthesis of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, resulting in reduced production of reactive nitrogen species and attenuated nitrosative stress. It also limited oxidative damage, reflected by decreased protein oxidation, and restored fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, Klotho regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and activity, thereby protecting heart contractile proteins from degradation. The Klotho protein exhibits significant cardioprotection in IRI by mitigating oxidative and nitrosative stress through the modulation of the NOS/MMP signalling pathway. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of Klotho in managing ischemic heart conditions and myocardial injury.", "relevance_score": 6.3046, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Intense training sessions drain the body’s carbohydrate reserves, which muscles depend on for performance. If those stores stay low, it can slow recovery and reduce the ability to grow muscle. ( 1 ) Pairing carbs with quality protein restores glycogen and spares muscle tissue from further breakdown. Carbs are massively anti-catabolic. They prevent muscle loss to a huge extent. Dr. Israetel believes that consuming a post-workout sooner rather than later helps to halt muscle breakdown, setting the stage for better recovery. ( 5 ) A post shared by Casey Kelly (@caseykellyfit) “Relatively low-fat, high-carb, high-quality protein within 30 minutes of your workout…no more check marks left,” Dr. Israetel explained. Even strength athletes and strongmen in a calorie surplus follow the same strategy: Aim for clean, nutrient-dense foods, then fill the gaps with higher-calorie options to meet energy demands. You have a total calorie budget to hit. Establish a core of healthy foods that give you the most benefits. Balancing high protein and carbs with low fat is Dr. Israetel’s recipe for rapid recovery and muscle growth.

This study aims to evaluate the quality of evidence regarding the safety, efficacy, and impact factors of applying the resorbable bio-inductive collagen implant clinically to repair rotator cuff injuries.\n\nMETHODS: The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022367522). A systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to October 2024) for clinical studies on bio-inductive collagen implants for rotator cuff repair. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality (using RoB1 for RCTs, NOS for cohort studies and JBI critical appraisal tools for case series). Primary outcomes included postoperative tendon thickness, shoulder function scores (ASES/Constant), and re-tear rates. Data were analyzed using random/fixed-effects models to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs, with subgroup analyses for tear type, patient age, and postoperative mobilization time.

In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice.

Some lifters treat it as a free pass to load up on burgers, fries, and milkshakes in the name of “getting big.” Sure, the scale moves up fast, but so does your body fat, leaving you sluggish in the gym and staring at an extended, painful cut when it’s time to lean down. The reality is, bulking doesn’t have to be an all-you-can-eat buffet. A well-run bulking cycle is calculated, structured, and purposeful. I’m talking about adding slabs of quality muscle while keeping fat gain under control, so that when you transition out, you’re bigger, stronger, and still relatively lean.  Think of it like tuning a race car. You can’t just dump in cheap fuel and expect world-class performance. With the right balance of nutrition, training, and recovery, you can build size that lasts, strength that translates, and a physique you’ll be proud of at the end of the cycle. I’ve seen this firsthand both in the weight room and on the performance field. As a coach with a Master’s in Sports Performance, NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS), National Sports Performance Association Certified Sports Nutrition Coach, and USAW National Coach, I’ve helped athletes and lifters of all levels bulk the right way. Whether it’s preparing an Olympic weightlifter for competition or guiding everyday athletes in the gym, the same principles hold: smart bulking builds muscle without the baggage. In the sections ahead, we’ll lay out the blueprint for bulking smarter: dialing in your calories without overdoing it, training for muscle instead of just numbers, and building the daily habits that separate the jacked from the bloated. Make this list your go-to menu to gain muscle without fat. Calories drive growth, but the quality and quantity of those calories determine if you’re building lean muscle or just adding belly fat. As a certified nutrition coach, I’ve seen lifters make the same mistake over and over again, thinking bulking means eating without limits. That might move the scale, but most of that weight comes from fat. A better approach is starting with a moderate surplus of 250–500 calories above maintenance. This keeps your body in growth mode without forcing you to diet for months on end afterward. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Find Your Surplus Sweet Spot: Track weekly weight gain. A reasonable rate is 0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week. Faster than that, and your body is likely storing fat instead of building muscle. Coach’s Note: Eating like it’s Thanksgiving every night isn’t bulking—it’s bingeing. Smart bulking involves consuming clean foods in slightly larger quantities and adjusting your intake as your body responds. Training during a bulk is about creating the right stimulus for hypertrophy while maintaining optimal recovery. The goal is to convert extra calories into high-quality muscle with consistent, structured training. As a strength coach, I program bulking cycles differently from strength or peaking cycles. The priority is progressive overload in the hypertrophy range. This means pushing for steady increases in weight, reps, or sets each week to build muscle mass rather than test maximum strength. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Coach’s Note: During a bulk, volume and quality are the focus. Push for consistent progress in your training and avoid sloppy lifting that can stall your results. Training and nutrition are the foundation of a bulk, but lifestyle choices decide how well your body responds. Recovery, sleep, hydration, and stress management are often the difference between gaining lean muscle and spinning your wheels. Here’s what I emphasize with athletes: Coach’s Note: Lifestyle is the glue that holds training and nutrition together. Dial in these habits, and your bulking cycle will run smoother with far better results. Not all bulks are created equal. A smart bulk builds lean mass with minimal fat gain, while a dirty bulk leaves you sluggish and forces you into a long, painful cut. Here’s the difference I highlight with lifters: Coach’s Note: A lean 10 pounds gained from a smart bulk will outperform a sloppy 20 every time. Muscle built with intention lasts, while fat only adds more work later. Bulking should never be an excuse to get sloppy. With the right balance of nutrition, structured training, and supportive lifestyle habits, you can add lean muscle that looks good and performs even better. The key is precision—eating enough to grow, training with intent, and recovering so your body can utilize the extra calories effectively. A smart bulk builds strength, confidence, and muscle mass that you’ll retain even after the cycle ends. A dirty bulk only sets you up for extra fat loss later. The difference comes down to discipline and consistency in the details. The bodybuilder is readying for the pro stage with his own brand of \"science.\" If the majority of your answers are “yes,” you’re bulking smart. If not, it’s time to tighten up your approach before small mistakes become significant setbacks. Coach’s Note: When you step into a bulking cycle, think precision, not permission. Fuel your training, recover properly, and build size you’ll be proud of when it’s time to show the results.

Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness.

Each segment of the SpA operon, from the 5' promoter region and signal peptide to the 3' cell wall anchoring region, has been exploited for various innovative applications in areas such as immunology and biotechnology. We provide an overview of selected applications and concepts that have had a significant impact on life science research, and some that have also led to significant commercial implications. In the 1980s, the SpA promoter and signal sequence were utilized in Escherichia coli for recombinant production of various proteins, yielding product secretion to the culture medium and thereby simplifying product recovery. The five homologous Ig-binding domains of SpA gained tremendous interest in the late 1980s, largely due to the rise of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use, prompting a growing demand for effective affinity ligands to facilitate their purification. Over the years, these Ig-binding domains have been extensively investigated and re-engineered to bind proteins other than antibodies, leading in the mid-1990s to the development of the affibody affinity protein technology. Today, affibody molecules are being investigated in late-stage clinical trials as potential protein therapeutics for various indications. Finally, the cell wall anchoring regions of SpA inspired the development of a surface display system for Staphylococcus carnosus, which has emerged as a technology platform in combinatorial protein engineering for work with large peptide, antibody and affibody libraries.", "relevance_score": 5.0901, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "recovery"]}

This study evaluated a topical medical device containing HA and amino acids for its safety and efficacy in treating hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds.\n\nMETHOD: This four-week, one-arm, two-centre pilot clinical study included patients with hard-to-heal wounds of various aetiologies. Wounds were classified by exudate level and amount of necrosis. Treatment with different vehicles (cream, gel or powder) was tailored based on wound characteristics. Wound size was measured at baseline and final visit, while symptom severity was tracked using the total symptom score (TSS). Investigator assessment and safety monitoring were also conducted.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the study. Wound size reduced significantly across all groups, with an average reduction of 54%, and 41% of patients achieving complete healing. Symptom severity, as measured by TSS, showed a consistent and significant reduction. Clinical improvement was observed in 95% of patients and no serious adverse events were reported.

Their presence has been detected in human tissues, including blood and placental tissue, raising concerns about developmental effects. However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation.

Living organisms undergo the ageing process simultaneously with their growth and development, characterized by constant cell division that leads to a decrease in the telomeric region of the chromosome. An active telomerase enzyme that adds a sequence of nucleotides to telomeres can keep them from shortening. The telomerase enzyme, on the other hand, is generally not active in skin cells due to constrained regulation. Research has demonstrated that anti-ageing drugs under development can activate the telomerase enzyme. The study used a computer-based method to examine how well patchouli plant parts could work as telomerase enzyme activators in cells' metabolic pathways. This research uses an in silico approach with three primary methods: network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. According to the network pharmacology study, the compounds found in the patchouli plant parts can turn on the telomerase enzyme through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Compounds in the patchouli plant activate the AKT1, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 proteins. These proteins are part of the telomerase enzyme activation pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics analyses show that patchouli plant compounds bind well to each protein, implying that the patchouli plant can activate telomerase. Both in vitro and in vivo tests are required to verify these findings.", "relevance_score": 4.1019, "relevance_hits": ["plant", "protein"]}

However, most studies have focused on low protein diets to stimulate autophagy and reduce ageing-related factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological, metabolic and molecular effects of a 7-day plant-based FMD with low protein/high fat (LP) and high protein/low fat content (HP) in healthy humans and compare those responses to a non-intervention comparator control group.\n\nMETHODS: Forty six healthy men and women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CONTROL (isoenergetic diet), n = 16 (mean ± SD age 35.0 ± 9.5 yrs, BMI 23.3 ± 2.7 kg\n\nRESULTS: Both FMDs reduced body weight and fat mass (interaction effects P < 0.0001) but only HP-FMD reduced visceral fat mass relative to CONTROL [mean difference (95 % CI): -0.09 (-0.15 to -0.03) kg, P = 0.006]. Both FMDs reduced fasting plasma glucose by ∼10 % [LP-FMD: -0.41 (-0.80 to -0.02) mmol\n\nCONCLUSION: Both FMDs promoted cardiometabolic health and induction of autophagy, with HP-FMD selectively conferring novel benefits in body composition, circulating lipid profiles, heart rate variability and gut microbiome health. These findings suggest that FMDs with varied macronutrient compositions could be customised to better align with individual health goals and preferences.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT06560996.

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!", "relevance_score": 4.0, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

From the introductory paragraph:\n\n>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume “1.6-2.2g/kg” [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don’t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you’ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume – it certainly won’t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn’t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.\n\nThis article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition.", "relevance_score": 4.0, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

All of my scans have been perfect, and I am effectively cancer free according to my doctors. Thank goodness! In spite of that, I am still having a tough time putting weight on like I used to, and I still have other symptoms (like night sweating) which are commonly associated with cancer. Because of all that, I decided that it was finally time to get my ass back in the gym. The way I see it is, if I can actually build some mass and keep it on, then I have little reason to be concerned about my health at this point (considering the good scans and the word of my doctors.)  \n  \n**Part of that process for me has always been consuming whey protein powder.** I was struggling to hit the recommended macros for my weight, even before getting cancer, and that is especially the case now. In the past, I would default to Nutricost's Choc/PB Whey Isolate, which I would drink with milk or blend it into a smoothie after my workout. At the time, I was very satisfied with their product and this routine. Since getting cancer, however, I have become concerned over the fact that a lot of these commercial protein powders contain lead and other heavy metals, as well as BPA, etc... and started looking into possible alternatives to Nutricost. So far, I have had a very hard time finding anything that is up to my standards. I even looked into organic beef protein as a potentially viable alternative to whey protein, only to discover that the most \"organic-seeming\" brand I could find contained 5x the level of arsenic as a can of sardines. I've looked into other types of protein too, and I just keep getting crap.\n\nAs somebody who is just getting over cancer, I am really not trying to poison myself with this sort of thing any longer; I *want* to make healthy lifestyle changes. I've been doing a ton of research over these past two weeks, but I keep coming up short. A lot of places don't display their heavy metals testing-- or, if they do, the tests are rarely ever dated. I've personally called around and emailed many of these companies directly, but they won't send me their tests. I am hearing many versions of \"Yeah, we're compliant, I promise... No we won't send you the tests, those are proprietary,\" and I can't tell you how absolutely frustrating this is as a diligent consumer.  \n  \nCan anybody please recommend me a few brands to look into, that meet my criteria? I want an organic, daily-use protein powder that is free of BS. No heavy metals, BPA, and other carcinogenic crap...

Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models. A case study on cancer-related protein interactions from the DrugBank database further demonstrates the framework's precision in identifying key drug-protein affinities, reinforcing its potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing.", "relevance_score": 3.8057, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein", "strength"]}

A novel approach based on molecular imprinting technology was developed to detect biomarkers associated with wound inflammation, using biopolymeric materials. In this study, an electrochemical biosensor for the selective detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) was developed by modifying gold screen-printed electrodes (Au-SPE) with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The high-performance sensor film was prepared by the electropolymerization of an aniline monomer in the presence of chitosan polysaccharide and a CRP template on the Au-SPE surface. Key parameters, including the removal agent, scanning rate and the number of electropolymerization cycles, were systematically optimized. Optimal MIP performance, characterized by an enhanced electrochemical response upon recognition of the template molecules, was achieved using a scan rate of 50 mV/s and five electropolymerization cycles. The results demonstrated that this biocompatible biosensor platform exhibited exceptional selectivity and sensitivity, enabling the detection of CRP at concentrations ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. The incorporation of chitosan into the MIP matrix represents a strategic advancement with significant potential for healthcare applications, owing to its inherent biocompatibility and well-documented benefits in tissue engineering. Additionally, chitosan improves the stabilization of macromolecular templates and enhances their binding interactions with functional monomers.

These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway.

The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest.

Melatonin induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, modulates autophagy, and promotes apoptosis in various tumors, including gastric, ovarian, cervical, oral tongue, colorectal, renal, hepatic, and bladder cancer. In placental choriocarcinoma, melatonin reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, its effects on ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway remain unexplored. It is hypothesized here that the proapoptotic effects of melatonin in choriocarcinoma cells occur through the activation of the UPR pathway. The factors implicated in the UPR (PERK, IRE1ɑ, ATF6, GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, P-eIF2α) pathways were evaluated by Western blot, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry in BeWo (human choriocarcinoma) cells treated with or without melatonin (1 mM). Melatonin significantly increased protein levels of GRP78 (p = 0.0329), IRE1α (p = 0.0394), p-eIF2α (p = 0.0439), ATF4 (p = 0.0267), CHOP (p = 0.0379), Bax and cleaved PARP but did not affect TRAF2 and NFkB protein levels nor XBP1 mRNA splicing. PERK knockdown, via siRNA, prevented the rise in GRP78, p-eIF2α/eIF2α, and ATF4 levels by melatonin. Additionally, melatonin increased early apoptosis in BeWo cells (p = 0.0371) and PERK knockdown increased the susceptibility of BeWo cells to apoptosis when treated with tunicamycin (p = 0.0359), suggesting that ER stress plays a role in BeWo cell survival. This study demonstrates that melatonin activates the PERK-ATF4-P-eIF2α-CHOP pathway and induces early apoptosis in BeWo cells, while PERK deficiency compromises cell survival under ER stress. Our findings suggest that modulating PERK-UPR signaling with melatonin could present a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, including placental choriocarcinoma.", "relevance_score": 3.6058, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. The review was narrative rather than systematic, so no formal risk-of-bias scoring was applied. Eighty percent of studies were conducted on young men, with the first female randomized controlled trial only appearing in 2025, limiting data for females. Sample sizes were typically under 60 participants, and most studies lasted only 8-12 weeks, leaving long-term effects unclear. The muscle-building effects of ashwagandha are evident. “There is a discernible increase in lean mass that’s measured and verifiable,” Dr. Israetel explained, “It comes out to roughly a few pounds of muscle over that typical time course.” Approximately 25-40% of creatine’s muscle-building capacity; modest but meaningful. The results for strength were slightly better: the effects of “40 to 60% of the effect of creatine” for one-rep max improvements, typically showing 5-8% increases over 8-12 week programs. Ashwagandha appears to function through hormonal modulation. “Testosterone makes you jacked, cortisol makes you less jacked,” Dr. Israetel declared. “Testosterone makes you leaner, cortisol makes you less lean.” ( 2 )( 3 ) “If you reduce cortisol substantially with [ashwagandha] and boost testosterone, that’s where many of these other benefits really come from,” Dr. Israetel clarified. Ashwagandha appears to boost VO₂ max significantly, with studies showing approximately 4ml/kg/min improvements over 8-12 weeks. ( 4 ) This enhancement in aerobic capacity could improve recovery between sets and training sessions. Recovery markers showed improvement, demonstrating 10-20% better recovery scale scores and reduced soreness perception. A post shared by Blast Vitality (@blastvitality) Ashwagandha has robust effects on stress management, with multiple studies demonstrating anxiety reduction. ( 5 )( 6 )( 7 )( 8 ) This has psychological and physiological benefits, such as improved training outcomes through better sleep quality and lower chronic cortisol exposure. ( 9 ) While generally safe for most healthy adults, ashwagandha isn’t always completely side-effect-free, with many reports of undesirable mental and physical reactions. Reducing stress and anxiety, though good, could interfere with natural emotions if excessive. The review positions ashwagandha as a “moderate multi-mechanism adjunct” rather than a tier-one supplement like creatine. Ashwagandha provides roughly half of creatine’s physiological effects plus more benefits. Stressful periods like the latter stages of fat loss, when cortisol levels are elevated, may be optimal for ashwagandha dosing. Taking 300-600mg daily of high-quality extract in the morning may offer a low-risk option for modest but noticeable improvements. Always speak to your physician before taking new supplements.

Here's what you need to know.  </p>\n\nOur product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? FOR MOST GUYS , biceps training is pretty straightforward. Including even a single isolation exercise into a balanced strength routine once or twice a week will help you build the strength and flex appeal you're hoping to achieve. The reason: Your bis are engaged in just about every upper body pulling exercise ( chinup , pulldown , bent-over row , etc.) you do, so for most strength training goals, you don’t need to hit them with as many targeted moves as you might for a larger muscle group like your pecs or quads. But if you want to maximize your flex appeal so your arms are the focal point of your physique—even in the winter through a thick puffer jacket—you'll need more focused work. That takes a more dedicated approach like you’ll find in our Ultimate Arms Recomp training plan. That also raises an important question: What’s the ideal number of biceps-focused exercises you should include in your routines for optimum growth? We've got answers. If you’re prioritizing upper arm hypertrophy , you likely have at least one day per week when you really hammer your arms . That training session should contain three dedicated biceps moves that meet the following guidelines: An exercise that you can load maximally, such as a standing dumbbell , barbell, or EZ bar curl. The goal here is to push the limits of your strength so that you struggle to bang out your final few reps with good form. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps An exercise that changes your upper arm angle relative to your torso (e.g., a preacher curl , incline curl , or Bayesian/cable curl). That will challenge your biceps with a different “ strength curve ,” moving the most challenging point of curl from the middle to the beginning or end of the movement. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps An exercise that changes your wrist angle to emphasize your brachialis , the muscle directly beneath your biceps that’s just as important for upper arm girth and even more important for elbow flexion. The hammer curl, reverse curl , and Zottman curl are all excellent options. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps Performing an exercise from each of those categories will help ensure maximum muscle fiber recruitment and engagement. This approach will also inject your arm training with enough variety to avoid strength plateaus—as long as you continue to reach for heavier weights as you get stronger and switch up the exercises you perform about every two months. The short answer is: probably not. The long answer requires some context. If we expand our muscular view beyond the biceps, research shows that three targeted exercises (or about 10 total sets) is the minimum weekly recommendation for maximum growth, with the sweet spot likely closer to six exercises (or 20 total sets). So why limit yourself when it comes to your biceps? The answer is that those two-headed elbow flexors are among your body’s top workhorses, assisting other muscles as “secondary” movers in countless other exercises. Not only do your biceps kick into gear during isolation moves such as those mentioned above, but they also spring into action during just about every upper body pulling exercise you can imagine. That means every time you perform a pullup, pulldown, or row variation, you enlist your bis to help get the job done. They’re even engaged during exercises such as the deadlift and farmer’s walk to maintain grip strength and elbow joint tension and stability. That’s why performing more than three to six targeted biceps exercises a week will be overkill—even for those prioritizing arm growth. And if such growth is a priority, it’s also important not to neglect your triceps. After all, they comprise about two-thirds of your upper arms’ mass. Fortunately, the same rules apply when selecting triceps exercises. Check out our picks for the best 15 triceps exercises to round out your arm training.

The swollen sensation that comes when your target muscles are engorged with blood is the highlight of training for many meatheads, so much so that \"chasing the pump\" is a go-to descriptor for a particular approach to workouts, filled with marathon sets to capture the feeling. Yes, you can build muscle when you chase the pump—but you're leaving gains on the table when you exhaust yourself in its pursuit. There are limitations to what you can accomplish when you're training with that objective, since you'll likely be using isolation exercises to target specific muscles rather than compound movements and lighter weights to be able to take on a high volume of reps. You won't be able to train as intensely as you need to for maximal muscle growth. There are more effective ways to build muscle and more efficient methods to go about it. Specifically, an approach often called reps in reserve (RIR). The approach is relatively simple, according to MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., who broke it down as a solution to the common mistake of chasing the pump in his Don't List video for building muscle. Using RIR in your workouts will allow you to train with the intensity needed to create stimulus for muscle growth, and the concept is exactly as the name implies: RIR refers to the amount of reps you could realistically perform (with good form) if you were to keep going after the prescribed reps were completed. Here's how to apply it: For all of the working sets of your session, challenge yourself to the point that you feel like you would only be able to complete two more reps. You're not training to failure here; that approach can be useful in specific scenarios, but you would burn out too quickly to achieve the type of muscle-building stimulus you're hoping to elicit if you fail each set. If your training plan was to perform 3 sets of 8 reps, for example, you would push to make the eighth rep hard enough that you would only be able to perform two more with good form. \"The final rep that you do is going to be slower than the earlier reps that you did, and is going to be hard and challenging,\" Samuel says. \"You might have a little bit of doubt whether you can actually complete the rep with good form.\" That struggle is what you're aiming to achieve. Samuel says that it's okay if your form wavers a bit near the end—but make sure that you don't push beyond your limits. If you find yourself finishing that final rep easily, on the other hand, that doesn't mean to push to 10 or 12 reps for every set. Instead, use that as a gauge of your effort. That's a sign to use heavier weights so that you can reach the level of intensity you're aiming to achieve. Want to know more about building real muscle?

We've got answers.</p>\n\nPOP QUIZ: HOW many reps and sets should you do per exercise to build muscle? If you’re in the know, you're aware that the answer is generally three to four sets of eight to 12 reps (although recent research has shown muscle building can occur at lower rep ranges, too ). You likely also understand that load, rest period duration , and training frequency are also key variables when it comes to packing on lean mass. After all, hypertrophy (the technical term for muscle growth) is largely a numbers game, and getting the equation right can equal maximum gains in minimal time. You want to work hard, but your goal should be to work efficiently. Junk volume is a real problem you'll want to avoid—especially if you're working with limited time. With that in mind, there’s one aspect of weight room arithmetic that many guys get wrong (or at least overlook): How many exercises you should perform per muscle group to optimize your results. “More is better” is the most common approach, but research shows that there are lower and upper limits to this muscle math—and hitting the sweet spot between them is key to getting (and staying) on the hypertrophy fast track. The answer is different if your goal is strength or endurance (and more experienced lifters will be able to handle more volume), but if your primary focus is muscle growth, you should perform a minimum of three exercises per muscle group per week. Those exercises can be performed during a single workout (if you’re doing traditional split training, for example) or spread across two or three workouts (if you’re hitting your whole body each time), but the key is to perform at least three exercises per muscle group per week. (We’ll get into how to select those exercises in the next section.) This applies to the big muscle groups, like the legs and back. For smaller muscle groups like the biceps, triceps, and shoulders, where lots of exercises will be single-joint movements, you can aim for fewer sets. \"Perhaps one to two exercises,\" advises Men's Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., \"since the functions of those muscles are simpler.\" Also, keep in mind that the more complicated compound exercises will also involve those muscle groups, so you're training them that way, too. What’s the maximum number? That’s a good question—and one that science has yet to answer. Stacking on extra sets for each muscle group might also not be a realistic approach for regular guys with busy schedules. Who has time for that kind of targeted exercise volume except elite bodybuilders? In the real world, the consensus is that if you do between 10 and 20 sets (roughly three to six exercises) per muscle group per week, you’ll achieve the muscle-building sweet spot. Let’s start with the lower end of the spectrum, three exercises per week—a number that can be performed in a single workout or distributed across two or three training sessions, depending on your goals and schedule. Priority number one is to select an exercise that moves the targeted muscle group through maximum contraction and extension, and the associated joints through a full range of motion. If we’re talking quads, the barbell back squat is the perfect example. Next, you want to choose an exercise that varies one of the following three variables: plane of motion , angle of attack (in other words, varying the position of the exercise from the first exercise), or portion of the strength curve (where in the movement you'll be forced to exert the most force to complete the rep). Still focusing on the quads, that might mean a side squat, a leg press, or a front-loaded squat, respectively. Finally, choose a challenging bodyweight exercise . Make no mistake, unweighted moves aren’t just for beginners. In almost every instance, there’s a bodyweight exercise that can be just as challenging (or even more so) than its fully loaded counterpart. In the case of the squat, that exercise could be the pistol squat , which is performed on one leg at a time. (If you can’t perform an unassisted pistol squat, hold onto a stable pole or other supportive structure to make it easier.) Keep building your arsenal for each muscle group from there if you plan on hitting them more than once per week. The key is variation (within a structured program, of course). By consistently challenging each muscle group in multiple ways, you’ll ensure enough exercise variety in your training plan to not only maximize growth, but also to avoid plateaus.

Wait, what? Cardio and core? Before you click away, continue reading. The truth is, if you’re still training cardio and core separately, now’s the time to try combining both workouts—it can be a more efficient way to double your sweat return. Here’s where you can begin: This 15-minute bodyweight circuit blends high-intensity intervals with core-strengthening moves that not only burn calories but also build strength, coordination, and toughness. It targets your midsection through rotation, anti-rotation, and isometric tension while keeping your heart rate sky-high. All you need is your body, towels, open floor space, and 15 minutes to get after it. Whether you’re looking for a conditioning finisher or a standalone session, this one’s for you. When you combine core exercises with cardio-style intervals, you’re not just building abs; you’re also training your heart and lungs to be more efficient , rotate stronger, and resist fatigue where it matters most. This 30/30 format (30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest) balances effort and recovery while allowing you to push yourself hard. What makes this circuit effective is that each move challenges your core from different angles through rotation, anti-rotation, bracing, or balancing. You’re not just torching calories. You’re:  To maximize this workout, follow my tips below because when done well, it builds strength while burning calories. Here’s how to make every second count:  You’ll perform each exercise after a warm-up for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of rest, and repeat for three total rounds. 1A. Bodyweight Woodchopper (15 seconds per side) Targets: Obliques, shoulders, glutes, coordination Tip: Let the rotation come from your hips and torso, not your arms alone. 1B. Alternating Skater Hop to Stick Targets: Glutes, quads, adductors, core, balance Tip: Focus on landing quietly and your knee aligned with your foot. 1C. Alternating Rotational Mountain Climbers Targets: Rectus Abs, obliques, hip flexors, shoulders Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked over your wrists and your hips low. Twist with intent, not momentum. 1D. Hollow Hold Flutter Kicks Targets: Lower abs, hip flexors, core stability Tip: If your lower back arches, scale by raising the legs higher or bending the knees. 1E. Push-Up to Shoulder Tap Targets: Chest, triceps, shoulders, core stability Tip: Widen your feet to stay balanced and avoid excessive torso twisting. Avoid swaying or sagging, as you should keep your hips locked in. When you’re finished, your core’s cooked, your shirt’s soaked, and your body is buzzing with endorphins. You didn’t just get a sweat, you trained rotational power, dynamic stability, and cardiovascular endurance in just 15 minutes. Then walk away from this workout knowing you’ve accomplished something efficient and effective. This circuit isn’t your typical cardio. It’s core-focused, athlete-oriented, and built for real-world strength. Use it as a finisher, a standalone session, or a quick option when time is limited but you still want results.

It started with the German Olympic weightlifting team in the 1970s. GVT became known for its simplicity: choose a big lift , perform 10 sets of 10 reps, and let the volume push your body to grow. No gimmicks, just a high volume and the grit to push through it. Here, we’ll explain exactly what GVT is, who it’s best suited for, its pros and cons, and, if you’re ready, provide a sample workout so you can see if you have what it takes to handle this physical and mental challenge.  German Volume Training was popularized in the 1970s by German national weightlifting coach Rolf Feser as a method to help lifters advance to a higher weight class during the off-season. The premise was unforgiving but straightforward—expose the muscles to an extreme amount of work in a short period to force rapid hypertrophy. In North America, strength coach Charles Poliquin brought GVT into the spotlight in the 1990s, writing about it and refining it for modern lifters. His adaptations preserved the essence of the program—high volume, controlled rest, and a laser focus on compound lifts—while making it more accessible to gym-goers outside the competitive weightlifting world. At its core, German Volume Training is about one thing—overloading your muscles with volume so they have no choice but to grow. The key number? 10 sets of 10 reps for a single big, compound movement. Here’s what makes it tick: The combination of high volume, controlled rest, and focused exercise selection creates an environment that enhances both physical strength and mental resilience. The program is best suited for: If you’re new to lifting, short on time, or still mastering the basics, this method is like trying to run a marathon before you’ve jogged a mile. Before trying any new program, even ones that have been around for over 50 years, like German Volume Training, it pays to weigh up your pros and cons, so you know if it’s right for you. GVT is excellent for a short, focused hypertrophy phase when your recovery is optimal. If you’re looking for maximum strength or are already low on sleep and stressed, a moderate-volume plan with more extended rest periods is the better choice.  If you’ve made it this far and are still eager to give GVT a try, start with this 6-week workout, which focuses on the basics. Split: 3 days per week with a full-body emphasis over the week. Main Lift: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM. Rest: Upper body: 60 to 90 seconds between sets Lower body: 90 to 120 seconds between sets Progression: When you hit all 10×10 with good form, increase the load by 2–3% the following week. Accessory Work: Keep it light, around 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps. 1. Back or Front Squat: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM, (90 to 120 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Romanian Deadlift: 3 sets, 10–12 reps @80% 1 RM 2B. Ab Rollout: 3 sets, 6-10 reps 1. Barbell Bench Press Variation: 10 sets 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Pull-Up (weighted if possible): 3 sets, 6–10 reps 2B. Stability Bent-Over Reverse Fly: 3 sets, 10–15 reps (per side) 1. Trap-Bar Bent-Over Row: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Conventional or Trap Bar Deadlift: 3 sets, 6 reps 2B. Isometric Elevated Split Squat: 3 sets, 30-45 sec. per side Weeks 1–2: Focus on good form and completing all sets and reps. Weeks 3–4: Once you hit 10×10, add weight (2-5 pounds for upper-body exercises and 5-10 pounds for lower body exercises). Weeks 5–6: Push yourself to the upper end of your capacity if you meet all your reps in week four and add weight. If the increase is too much, you can decrease the weight during your working sets. Mobility and stretching on off days are crucial for staying injury-free. Wasn’t that fun? The rise of the hybrid athlete continues with this multi-faceted approach to fitness. These guidelines can make the difference in helping protect your workout partner from injury.

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Few things feel more invigorating than lacing up your hiking boots and exploring a new trail . From the sun-drenched days of summer to crisp autumn afternoons, hiking connects you with nature while feeding the mind, body, and soul. The newest trend to hit the trails? “Soft hiking,” which is all about keeping things light and intentional. We spoke with experts to learn six soft hiking techniques that actually build more strength than gym workouts after 45. Soft hiking emphasizes moving with purpose at a comfortable pace. You’re still challenging your body while weaving through uneven terrain and engaging your muscles without excessive load. “It uses less intense and slower therapeutic movements, balance, and resistance to natural bodyweight instead of high-impact movements,” says Shahinaz Soliman, MD , board-certified family physician with 20+ years of experience in patient care. “This modality is appropriate in people over 45 because it encourages building strength at a long-term, low-risk level that honors joint health and recovery requirements.” Inclines introduce a fresh challenge to your hike. Choose easy upward slopes while keeping your step-ups slow and steady. “This is a natural increase of glutes, hamstrings, and calves without the use of heavy weights,” says Soliman. Why People Are Ditching Regular Walks for ‘Nordic Walking’ Navigating objects like rocks and logs is another way to instantly boost the effectiveness of your hike. “The introduction of natural obstacles promotes the use of stabilizer muscles that are not given serious attention in gym machines,” Soliman says. 5 Walking Moves That Shrink Belly Fat Faster Than the Gym After 45 Don’t forget about working your arms! “Trekking poles or recreating arm movements will use upper body muscles and enhance overall coordination and calorie expenditure,” Soliman points out. Balaram Thapa , CEO of Nepal Hiking Team, notes to position the poles so that your elbows are near 90 degrees, and “plant-pull” with every step. Complete six sets of two-minute efforts on rolling ground, activating your core. When going downhill, descend slowly. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e “Slow, controlled [descent] is one of the most effective methods to strengthen quadriceps and enhance balance, compared to walking normally,” Soliman notes. Here’s How Long Your Incline Walking Workout Should Be To Shrink Belly Fat Weave some bodyweight exercises into your hike. The key is pausing and holding the movement. “Pause in lunge or half-squat poses a few times on the way to activate the core and leg muscles in the isometric mode with minimum load on the joints,” Soliman instructs. The #1 Walking Method To Shrink Belly Fat Fast After 50, According to a Trainer Thapa recommends hill repeats: climbing for three to four minutes, descending gradually, and repeating for four to six rounds in total. “Keep steps short, drive through the mid-foot, and breathe rhythmically,” Thapa says. According to Soliman, “Soft hiking combines various muscle groups dynamically and functionally in a natural setting, which puts greater pressure on the body as compared to isolated gym work. Balance, a controlled movement, and weight-bearing activities in uneven terrain encourage the neuromuscular coordination and stability of the joints.” Thapa says soft hiking loads various planes of movement. “[In addition, it] builds eccentric control, and [challenges] balance. You strengthen feet, ankles, knees, and hips together while protecting joints with self-selected pace and terrain.” Outdoor exercise promotes longer workout sessions and sustainability. In adults 45+, this equals safer strength gains and far less boredom that’s often associated with standard gym routines. Looking for easy ways to lose fat?

If you’re on a weight loss mission, your diet matters as much as hitting the gym. Being consistent with healthy meals plays a major part in dropping unwanted pounds and what you eat for dinner can make all the difference. While fad diets get a lot of attention on social media, trends don’t always deliver long-term results, but eating the right food does. To help kickstart your wellness journey, here are five dinners that are packed with flavor, nutrition and can help you slim down in 30 days, according to nutritionist Rania Batayneh , MPH author of the bestselling book, The One One One Die t. According to Batayneh, this salmon dish proves healthy and can also be quick and delicious. “Chilean salmon isa nutrition powerhouse, packed with omega-3 fats, vitamin D, and other nutrients that keeps your heart, brain, eyes, and joints happy. It is also one of the lowest-mercury seafood options and an FDA “Best Choice” for families. I often recommend,” She adds, “Chilean salmon because it delivers so much nutrition in a safe, affordable way. Keep a few frozen fillets on hand and you can have dinner on the table in minutes since they thaw in just 15 minutes. Served with asparagus and a tangy lemon dill yogurt sauce, this meal is fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.” Ingredients (Serves 2) 2 Chilean salmon fillets (4–5 ounces each) 1 bunch asparagus, bottoms trimmed 1 tbsp olive oil Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tbsp Greek yogurt 1 tbsp lemon juice 4 cherry tomatoes 1 tsp fresh dill, chopped Instructions 1. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Sear salmon skin-side down for 4–5 minutes, then flip and cook another 4–5 minutes, until cooked through. 2. In the same pan, sauté asparagus until tender. 3. Stir together Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and dill for the sauce. 4. Plate salmon with asparagus, spoon the sauce over top, and finish with cherry tomatoes. He Lost 100 Lbs After Stopping These 5 Eating Out Mistakes Protein 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e This Shrimp Fajita Bowl with Sorghum is a colorful, one-pan meal that layers shrimp, peppers, and onions over whole grain sorghum. Batayneh explains, “Sorghum is naturally gluten-free and provides essential nutrients including protein, fiber, iron, and antioxidants. As a source of fiber and resistant starch, sorghum helps regulate blood sugar levels, supports healthy digestion, and contributes to satiety. Finished with zesty spices, lime, and cilantro, this recipe is simple, flavorful, and nourishing. Ingredients (Serves 4) ½ cup dry whole grain sorghum (about 1½ cups cooked) 2 lbs shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 bell peppers, sliced 1 small red onion, sliced 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp cumin ½ tsp garlic powder Salt and pepper, to taste Fresh lime wedges and cilantro, for garnish Instructions 1. Cook sorghum according to package directions. 2. Toss shrimp, peppers, and onion with olive oil and spices. 3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and sauté until shrimp are pink andvegetables are tender, about 5–7 minutes. 4. Divide sorghum into bowls and top with shrimp and vegetables. 5. Garnish with lime and cilantro. Salmon is already a powerhouse of lean protein and omega-3 fats, but when you add pistachios, you boost both flavor and nutrition. “Pistachios bring plant-based protein, heart-healthy fats, and fiber to the plate, along with 30 vitamins and minerals,” says Batayneh.  “In this recipe, the jalapeño pistachios form a crunchy crust that pairs perfectly with the zesty cilantro-lime marinade, creating a dish that’s as nourishing as it is delicious. Roasted with potatoes, it’s a balanced meal that supports steady energy, satiety, and overall wellness.” Ingredients (Serves 4) 2 cups fresh cilantro 2 cloves minced garlic ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided Zest and juice of 1 lime 4 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1–1½ inches thick ½ cup jalapeño pistachios, divided 1½ pounds small potatoes, halved ½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided Instructions 1.

Remove air, seal, and marinate for 20 minutes in the refrigerator. 3. Add ¼ cup pistachios to the reserved marinade in the processor, pulse, and transfer to a bowl. Set aside. 4. Toss potatoes with ¼ teaspoon salt, ⅛ teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon oil. Spread on baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. 5. Remove sheet, stir potatoes, then move them to the sides. Remove salmon from marinade, tapping off excess, and place in center of pan, skin-side down. Discard marinade. Season with remaining salt and pepper. Bake until potatoes are tender and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. 6. Plate salmon and potatoes. Garnish with reserved pistachio mixture and remaining pistachios. This ABC Taco Salad is all about avocado, black beans, and cilantro. “Black beans bring plant-based protein and fiber that help keep you full and satisfied, while also providing key minerals like iron and magnesium,” Batayneh explains. She adds, “Creamy avocado steps in for cheese or sour cream, adding healthy fats and a rich texture. A squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro brighten the dish, making it as flavorful as it is nourishing.” Serve it as a hearty salad, enjoy it in warm corn tortillas, or pair it with rice for a balanced bowl. Ingredients (Serves 6) Cooking spray 2 cans (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained 1⁄4 cup water 2 avocados, peeled, pitted, and finely chopped 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup cilantro fresh, chopped 1⁄4 cup finely chopped sweet onion 1⁄4 teaspoon salt 3 limes, cut in half *6 corn tortillas (gluten-free)- optional Instructions: 1.

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Strength training after 40 might seem trickier than it was in your 20s and 30s, but the essence stays the same. It’s about staying powerful, protecting your joints, and building the kind of strength that supports everything from weekend activities to long-term health. Standing exercises are one of the best tools to get there. They engage your entire body, demand balance, and keep your core active while you move through strength-building patterns . Unlike traditional dumbbell routines that isolate one muscle group at a time, standing movements challenge multiple muscles together. This creates a stronger foundation for daily life and reduces your risk of injury. You’re not just training arms or legs—you’re training stability, coordination, and control in ways that carry over to real-world movement. The payoff is more than stronger muscles . Standing exercises improve posture, help protect your spine, and keep your hips, knees, and shoulders moving well as you age. That combination keeps you feeling younger, more capable, and less likely to deal with aches that slow progress. The six exercises ahead show how dumbbells can be used in creative ways that go beyond the basics. Each one builds strength that lasts, supports resilience, and helps you get more out of every workout after 40.  Side bends strengthen the often-neglected oblique muscles that protect your spine and improve rotational control. Past 40, building strength in the midsection goes beyond looks—it supports posture, protects your back, and helps you generate power in other lifts. Muscles Trained: Obliques, abdominals, erector spinae, hip flexors How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds. Best Variations: Suitcase carries, side planks with reach, kettlebell side bends Form Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked and avoid twisting your torso as you bend. 5 Power Exercises That Torch Belly Fat Faster Than Treadmill Workouts After 45  The push press builds explosive upper body strength while engaging the lower body for added support. It mimics athletic movement and teaches your body to transfer power from the ground up. After 40, this type of coordinated effort keeps your joints mobile and your muscles firing together. Muscles Trained: Shoulders, triceps, quadriceps, glutes, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps. Rest for 75 to 90 seconds. Best Variations: Barbell push press, single-arm push press, kettlebell push press Form Tip: Keep your core tight and avoid overarching your back as you drive the weights overhead. 5 Daily Bodyweight Exercises That Keep You Young After 40  Ski swings replicate the explosive hip drive of kettlebell swings but with dumbbells held at your sides. This builds posterior chain strength, cardiovascular endurance, and total-body coordination. For those over 40, it offers a safe yet effective way to enhance athleticism and conditioning. Muscles Trained: Hamstrings, glutes, lower back, shoulders, forearms How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 seconds. Best Variations: Kettlebell swing, alternating dumbbell ski swing, resistance band ski swing Form Tip: Hinge at your hips rather than squatting. The power should come from your glutes, not your arms. 5 Driveway Stretches That Reverse Stiffness Better Than Massage Therapy After 50  Woodchops train rotational strength and core stability, which are critical for longevity and performance. This movement extends to sports, daily tasks, and injury prevention. After the age of 40, training the body in twisting motions helps keep your spine strong and resilient.

Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs.", "relevance_score": 3.1367, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "safety"]}

While the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International Society for Sports Nutrition (ISSN) have established recommendations for nutrient intakes, many athletes do not meet the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for the general population, and sport and sex-specific differences are not well documented. Exploration of within-day energy balance (WDEB) shows athletes may achieve energy balance by the end of the day but may present with poor WDEB. Data support that female athletes are at greater risk of nutrient deficiencies than their male counterparts, and it is unclear whether swimmers meet sport-specific nutrient intake and timing recommendations.

Advancements in preoperative fasting guidelines have shifted towards more flexible approaches, such as allowing clear liquids up to 2 h before surgery and encouraging carbohydrate loading before elective surgery to improve glucose regulation and recovery. Prehabilitation strategies, including protein-rich nutrition and physical activity, improve postoperative recovery, particularly in frail patients. In the neurocritically ill, early enteral nutrition (EN) with low-to-moderate protein and calorie targets improves functional recovery and reduces complications. Recent studies challenge the necessity of prolonged fasting before extubation and ICU procedures. Despite evidence supporting reduced fasting, adherence to protocols remains low.\n\nSUMMARY: Advances in perioperative fasting protocols will likely improve recovery for neurosurgical patients. Early EN improves outcomes in neurocritically ill patients, while excessive calorie and protein intake may be detrimental.

Most studies reported positive associations between HRT and improvements in menopausal skin aging, but findings were sometimes inconsistent. Despite decades of research, clinical guidelines do not support HRT use solely for estrogen-deficient skin due to a lack of robust clinical trials on skin-specific therapy. Many women remain unaware of the skin-related impacts of menopause, which can affect quality of life, and few aesthetics studies analyze data based on menopausal status or HRT use.

However, the mechanism by which DUX4 exerts its toxicity remains unclear. In this study, we observed abnormal iron accumulation in muscles of patients with FSHD and in mice with muscle-specific DUX4 expression (DUX4-Tg mice). Treatment with iron chelators, an iron-deficient diet, and genetic modifications inhibiting intracellular uptake of iron did not improve but rather exacerbated FSHD pathology in DUX4-Tg mice. Unexpectedly, however, iron supplementation, from either a high-iron diet or intravenous iron administration, resulted in remarkable improvement in grip strength and running performance in DUX4-Tg mice. Iron supplementation suppressed abnormal iron accumulation and the ferroptosis-related pathway involving increased lipid peroxidation in DUX4-Tg muscle. Muscle-specific DUX4 expression led to retinal vasculopathy, a part of FSHD pathology, which was prevented by iron administration. Furthermore, high-throughput compound screening of the ferroptosis pathway identified drug candidates including ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Treatment with Fer-1 dramatically improved physical function in DUX4-Tg mice.

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation.

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes.

I have no idea which corticosteroid exactly. Based on the manufacturer’s other products and what I've read about them it’s most likely dexamethasone.\n\nDuring each period I took this supplement, my temples and under-eyes became hollow noticeably. Before taking it, despite being severely underweight for years, I had a lot of volume just UNDER my eyes and my temples weren’t THAT thin (but my cheeks were, obviously) the back of my jaw didn't look big or anything.\n\nThe hollowing worsened with each round of exposure. Looking back, the changes happened only during the times I took the supplement, I didn’t realize it at the time. This is not normal aging. This time this has become too hard to ignore I cannot keep living in denial and I highly suspect the corticosteroid in the supplement has been somehow hurting. My eyes literally look sunken, my face looks absolutely horrible from below/lower angle. My eyes used to be narrow and wide and now they look rounded as if something is constantly very lightly pulling on the bottom of them and there is this weird ridge on my eyelids from it as if there is excess skin.\n\nIn the Summer of 2024 I did a 1-month course. January 2025, 2 week (ish) course. In last may I did a 3 week course and starting on June 20th I did a roughly 45-day course which is the most recent. now I completely stopped.\n\n\nEven though I gained 20 pounds during the last round NONE of the fat went to my temples. they’re still hollow and look even worse than before\n\nMy arms actually gained subcutaneous fat which is really weird since corticosteroids supposedly cause fat loss in the arms. Yes I did get moon face in the lower half of my face (everything under my cheekbone), my stomach got a little bit bigger, but no fat loss in the arms??\n\n\nI also suspect the corticosteroids severely impacted my collagen and skin health my nasolabial folds are now very pronounced my skin barrier feels destroyed, and skin looks unhealthy overall and aged. Indentations on my forehead appeared that weren’t there before. Also after the first time I tried this supplement, I noticed dehydration lines around my mouth that I had never seen before in my life.\n\n\nI cannot find anybody else that has experienced this issue. Everything on reddit and google talks about moon face, buffalo hump, or peripheral limb fat loss, but nothing like this.\n\nI want to make this clear I did not take prescription corticosteroids deliberately. This was a contaminated supplement. I was laced. I'm not trying to promote anything illegal/dangerous and I don't plan on taking this shit ever again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced hollow temples or under-eyes after corticosteroids? Does anyone know how this might have happened and if this might improve after stopping, losing the gained weight, and waiting long-term? Because that's what I plan on doing. I also plan on taking biosil for my collagen, and a multivitamin since my diet has always been pretty lacking. I would seriously appreciate any insight.\n\nTL;DR: Took a Malaysian supplement (Kian Pee Wan) that was secretly laced with corticosteroids. Instead of just “moon face,” I developed severe hollowing in my temples/under eyes and skin/collagen damage that got worse each round. Stopped now and wondering if anyone else had this and if it can improve long-term", "relevance_score": 2.8, "relevance_hits": ["collagen"]}

Its high prevalence is driven by insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with cardiovascular disease. The main driver of liver damage is fat accumulation in hepatocytes leading to inflammation and fibrosis development. People with MASH and clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2/F3) are 'at risk' of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and are considered in need of treatment. Metabolic drivers of MASH originating outside the liver, for example, from the adipose tissue and the gut, and genetic heterogeneity contribute to making the prevalent pathogenetic factor difficult to dissect at an individual level. In this scenario, the Food and Drug Administration's conditional approval of the liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist Resmetirom as the first pharmacological treatment for MASH last March 2024 and the expected extension of the glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonist Semaglutide indication from diabetes and obesity to MASH mark a key milestone.

Despite its benefits, PEGylated proteins are often heterogeneous mixtures containing positional isoforms that are challenging to eliminate and can significantly impact the biological activity of drugs. This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes. As a result, it offers improved robustness and accuracy.

This case also highlights the need for HADHA and HADHB to be included in neuropathy gene panels as MTPD may present as CMT. Given that dietary management may prevent some complications of MTPD, achieving a diagnosis early is important.", "relevance_score": 2.5064, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein"]}

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development. In light of these findings, current nutritional strategies should be seriously reconsidered and recommended protein intakes for children must be urgently reevaluated.", "relevance_score": 2.4516, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "quality"]}

This study used the harmonized in vitro protocol INFOGEST to investigate the bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil in comparison to olive oil. Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, punicic acid is efficiently released by digestive lipases, suggesting good bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil. This finding paves the way for its potential application in oral therapeutic use.", "relevance_score": 2.4373, "relevance_hits": ["bioavailability", "protein", "recovery", "soy", "whey"]}

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach.

( 1 ) Created in the body from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine, this sports nutrition supplement helps your body produce more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energetic molecule that powers short, intense muscle contractions like those used in the Olympic lifts. Our product testers evaluated dozens of creatine supplements, including many that are vegan-friendly. In our testing , we looked at: We’ve helped nearly 2 million readers find high-quality supplements, and we’re confident our guide to the best vegan creatine supplements will help you do the same. Medical disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Also our choice for the best creatine supplement overall (vegan or otherwise), Transparent Labs Creatine HMB earns 4.5 out of 5 points for its formula, which includes a clinically backed dose of creatine monohydrate of 5 grams per serving. The powder also contains ß-hydroxy ß-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, which is known to play a role in reducing muscle protein breakdown. ( 2 ) On top of that, Transparent Labs Creatine HMB contains BioPerine black pepper fruit extract. Black pepper is a source of piperine, a compound thought to increase the bioavailability of nutrients — meaning, this creatine supplement could be more readily absorbed by your body than those without piperine. Finally, the inclusion of vitamin D may further enhance muscle protein synthesis. ( 3 )( 4 ) According to registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, it’s a really strong formula backed by clinical research. The one thing that’s missing, Bourgeois notes, is caffeine for those who take creatine pre-workout. “Many people include creatine as part of their workout routine,” she says. “This formula doesn’t contain any caffeine, which might be a bummer if that’s what you’re looking for.” Our product tester, who tried the Peach Mango flavor, liked the taste well enough, though “there’s something weird about it,” she says. “The flavor itself is good and strong enough, but I think the BioPerine, which is a derivative of black pepper, is altering the taste. When you smell it, it smells spicy in a weird way. When mixed, it tastes a bit bitter unless mixed with more than the recommended amount of water.” Still, she gives it 4 out of 5 points for taste. Additionally, all three of our testers who tried this product had issues with solubility, collectively awarding it 3.5 out of 5 points. They each noted that the powder didn’t dissolve fully, resulting in “floaties” that needed to be shaken up again before each swig. Read our full Transparent Labs Creatine HMB Review . Legion Creatine Gummies are the best creatine gummies overall, and they happen to be vegan-friendly, too. These gummies are formulated with the widely researched creatine monohydrate, and they provide the upper end of the optimal dose, which earns them 4 out of 5 points for formulation. Deductions in their score stem from the use of sugar alcohols, which can cause gastrointestinal distress in some individuals. According to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, “There’s definitely more room for research on creatine gummies, but Legion’s version is intriguing.” The clinically-backed dose, the third-party testing, and the flavor variety are all on her “pros list” for this product, she says. However, if you plan to start creatine supplementation with a loading phase , these gummies may be a no-go for you, she says, due to the fact that each serving contains 8 grams of sugar alcohols. “Research has shown that sugar alcohols like erythritol can cause digestive upset,” Bourgeois points out. “Sugar alcohols may cause nausea, bloating, and diarrhea, among other gastrointestinal effects.” Our tester didn’t have any issues with side effects, and mostly enjoyed their experience with the gummies, rating them with 4 out of 5 points for both taste and texture. They’re “more sweet than tangy and not a ton of flavor but easy enough to get down” and while “these do get stuck in your teeth a little and stick together in the jar,” it’s not a dealbreaker for our tester. Though pricey at about $1.50 per serving, Legion Creatine Gummies earn 4 out of 5 points for price because gummies in general are much more expensive than creatine powder. Legion also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if you don’t like them, no questions asked. This unflavored micronized creatine is available in two different size options and is Informed Sport certified, vegan, and gluten-free. You can even subscribe to recurring deliveries and save 15 percent. It doesn’t get simpler than this: This Sports Research supplement contains creatine monohydrate, and that’s it. No more, no less. “Each dose provides the upper end of what research deems the optimal dose of creatine monohydrate,” our tester says, “and there’s no unnecessary fluff to drive up your cost or potentially cause unwanted symptoms.” As such, this supplement earns 5 out of 5 points for its formula. “Sometimes, less is more in the supplement world,” says registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “You get a research-backed dose of creatine monohydrate here. Because it’s a straightforward supplement, there’s no puzzling it into your routine. It can fit easily.” If purity is a concern, you’ll be pleased to know that Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate is manufactured in a cGMP-compliant facility, Non-GMO Project Verified, NSF certified gluten-free, and NSF Informed Sport-certified. This creatine supplement also earns 5 out of 5 points for taste, or the lack thereof. It’s unflavored, and there’s no taste at all, our tester says. The same goes for solubility, which also earns 5 out of 5: “If you didn’t tell me there was creatine in this water I wouldn’t know. It’s truly tasteless and mixes easily,” our tester raves. That said, “If you’re someone who likes a little flavor in their creatine, you’re out of luck,” Bourgeois says. Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate only comes unflavored.” This no-frills creatine powder earns high marks from our expert product tester. “ProHealth hits all the high points,” they say, awarding it a perfect 5-out-of-5 score for the formula. “You get 5 grams of micronized creatine monohydrate per scoop, and each batch is third-party tested for quality, purity, and potency.” Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois likes the simplicity of ProHealth Longevity Creatine. “You don’t have to sacrifice research-backed dosing of creatine for other ingredients,” she says. “It’s also free of 10 major allergens: dairy, egg, soy, wheat, gluten, corn, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts. Not all creatine products are made in allergen-free facilities.” Bourgeois points out that ProHealth uses Creavitalis , which is marketed as a high-quality and easily absorbed creatine monohydrate, as opposed to the current standard used in most products, CreaPure . “We know creatine has a lot to offer, but I’d love to see more research on Creavitalis, specifically.” Bourgeois says. ProHealth Longevity Creatine earns 4 out of 5 points from our tester for taste. “I noticed a slight aftertaste in water, and my wife thought it tasted metallic, but we didn’t notice this when mixed in a sports drink” he says. Our tester gives it 5 out of 5 points for solubility, noting that it’s much more powdery than other creatines he’s tried so it mixes great, but it does settle at the bottom of the glass or bottle eventually. This product is more expensive than average for a plain creatine monohydrate powder at $0.55 per serving, so it earns 3.5 out of 5 points for price. However, the increased cost may be worth it to those who need a product certified to be free from the 10 major allergens. This extremely inexpensive creatine is micronized for extra solubility. We also appreciate Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate for its available flavor profiles, although the use of sucralose as a sweetening agent may lead to GI distress in some athletes. Fitness enthusiasts on a budget will love that Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate powder costs just 20 cents per serving. A tub of 100 servings will run you a little over $20, or less if you choose to subscribe and save. It earns a perfect score of 5 out of 5 points for price. It has a winning formula, too, earning 4.5 out of 5 points. While it contains the upper end of the clinically backed dose of creatine—5 grams per serving—a half-point deduction comes from the inclusion of sucralose in flavored options. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener known to cause digestive upset in some individuals, which is something to be aware of if you have a sensitive stomach. “Nutricost stays true to its name with this one,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, LDN. “Each serving provides a clinically-backed dose of creatine monohydrate at a budget-friendly price. I love that Nutricost doesn’t limit their dosing to keep your cost per serving low.” In addition to its low price, it tastes good, too. Rather, it tastes like nothing, our tester says, which is ideal for an unflavored creatine product. “It’s actually tasteless, even in water,” they say, awarding it 5 out of 5 points. Nutricost creatine doesn’t score quite as high for solubility, earning a score of 3 out of 5 points. It settles in the bottom of the glass if you don’t drink it in one go, our tester notes. Read our full Nutricost Creatine Review . Our team of product testers, which includes certified personal trainers, certified nutrition coaches, and other health and fitness professionals, spent weeks identifying and testing—yes, actually ingesting—dozens of creatine supplements. We evaluated eight criteria for each product we tried, rating each on a scale from 1 to 5: A score of 1-2 is below average; a score of 3 is average for the industry; a score of 4-5 is above average. These products are also great choices for anyone, including those on a vegan diet. Making a case for creatine isn’t hard: There’s a very long list of creatine benefits . Vegan creatine supplements range in price from about 20 cents per serving to nearly $2 per serving. Expect to pay about $20 to $50 per month, depending on the brand. As you shop for creatine , keep these factors in mind. Creatine monohydrate remains the gold standard. For enhanced bioavailability, look for micronized creatine powder. Other forms of protein, like creatine hydrochloride (HCl) and creatine ethyl ester, have not been proven more effective or beneficial. ( 16 ) Look out for fillers. Except for flavors—and in some cases, depending on the type of supplement (i.e., gummies), preservatives—creatine supplements don’t need many ingredients at all. In fact, some of the best creatine supplements contain just one ingredient: creatine. One common con of creatine is bloating, and minimizing artificial sweeteners and additives can help keep digestion smooth. If you plan to use your creatine pre-workout, consider a formula with caffeine to boost energy levels and further enhance exercise performance. If you want to be sure about the quality and purity of your creatine, look for independent analyses of the contents. The best indicator of quality is a certification from the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), but certificates of composition from any lab can tell you if the product contains any contaminants and if it is properly dosed. The cleanest vegan creatine supplements are those that contain only pure creatine monohydrate powder. Examples include Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate and Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate, both of which have a single ingredient: micronized creatine monohydrate. Yes. Vegan creatine is synthesized in a lab, and most creatine supplements on the market are made that way. Look out for gelatin in capsules and gummies if use of animal products is not negotiable for you. Unfortunately, it’s tough for vegans to get enough creatine from diet alone, since the most potent natural sources include red meat, poultry. and fish. Vegetarians can get small amounts through eggs and dairy products. Luckily, most lab-created creatine products are, in fact, plant-based creatine. Since they are synthesized chemically from the amino acids sarcosine and cyanamide, they do not contain animal byproducts. Exceptions include gelatin in capsules and gummies. Yes, of course. People on a vegan diet can build muscle by following a hypertrophic strength training plan, eating in a calorie surplus, and prioritizing protein and amino acid intake. Creatine is not directly involved in muscle-building processes like muscle protein synthesis. ( 17 ) However, it can improve athletic performance and muscle recovery, leading to increases in muscle strength and power.

In the best cases, these devices offer a bridge between what you subjectively feel and what you can objectively measure. This is generally a really cool and amazing thing. Our subjective feelings and assessments matter, but they’re not always the most reliable. Us humans just aren’t particularly skilled at quantifying our experiences and behaviors with cold precision. Take, for example, a colleague of mine. He believed he was eating within a narrow caloric window, but after careful tracking, he learned that he was putting away a bonus 500 Calories a day—in barbecue sauce. That said, some of us are better than others. Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter, was reported to have been able to call out his 100 metre time within a tenth of a second of the stopwatch readout. 1 That’s outlier performance, to be clear, but it still makes you wonder: And, how can you improve your accuracy through the wise use of technology—like fitness trackers—to help you make better decisions about your health? In the following article, we’ll tackle the above, plus we’ll address: Let’s get into it. Not all data is created equal. Some brands produce better products than others. This is not just hardware but also the quality of their software and datasets. Beyond that, not all things are equally easy to quantity. For example, heart rate and step-count data are generally reliable, 2 but many other types of outputs—from calories burned to movement velocity—have substantial margins for error. The below chart shows the reliability of various tracking devices. (If you’re curious, we cover the accuracy of various progress indicators in more detail here: Are Fitness Trackers Worth It? ) The good: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. The bad: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. “What’s really remarkable,” says Samantha Kleinberg, a computer scientist who studies decision-making, “is that even a tiny amount of surplus information has a big negative effect on our decision-making.” 3 That’s the paradox of tracking: Too little detail makes it tough to make the right decision, but so does too much. This can be expressed as an inverted U, with the sweet spot at the top of the curve. Consider the analysis paralysis you feel after scanning hundreds of reviews from the various taco places in your neighborhood. (All you wanted was a decent el pastor, but now you don’t know which taqueria to pick!) Finding just enough information to make good decisions is an art form—especially in the world of health and fitness, where it seems like everyone is trying to outdo each other when it comes to providing more science, more customization, and more complexity. But when all that information starts to blur together with no clear path forward, what should you do? For starters, you can ask yourself a simple question: Does tracking increase my wellbeing and performance? If the answer is a clear yes or no, you know what to do. (Either continue tracking as you were, or drop the gadget and walk away.) If you’re a little fuzzy, here are three signs to watch for to help you determine if tracking is helpful—or not. When Zak’s coach raved about the benefits of zone 2 cardio, it sounded logical. But when the rubber on his running shoes hit the road, Zak second-guessed everything. Zak prided himself on his ability to grind, and simply didn’t trust that something that felt easy could also be effective. Yet, the data didn’t lie. As the weeks went by, Zak watched his resting heart rate drop—along with his recovery time from hard runs. With that reassurance, Zak began to relax about the process—and his resting heart rate dropped further. Zak hadn’t trusted his feelings, but he did trust the data from his heart rate monitor. Using a tracking device enabled Zak to calibrate his own perceptions so they were more accurate and realistic. If you’re a coach who has a client like Zak who’s high performing but doesn’t know it, tracking can help build confidence and reduce the anxiety that they’re “not good enough.” Here, you empower them by shining a spotlight on existing performance. Expert assurance can go a long way but can also be bolstered by reliable data. (Recently, many people have begun using continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, in order to “optimize” their blood sugar levels. This can help “validate” certain food choices… but it can also be a waste of time. Read more: Should people without diabetes use CGMs? ) Sometimes, data can stress you out without any upside—like when you receive poor scores about things beyond your control. Take the new parent of a newborn who gets a poor sleep quality score. Tracking has a time and a place. When scores are beyond your control or your priorities lie elsewhere, tracking can create unnecessary stress and is counterproductive. You can always revisit tracking when circumstances or priorities change. For a behaviour to take place, you need three things 4 : Fitness trackers shine when you’ve got plenty of motivation and ability—and just lack the prompt. Take my client, Margaret. She used to have a glass of wine most nights, believing it helped her sleep better. Once she started wearing a sleep tracker though, she saw that her sleep quality was much poorer the nights she imbibed. Once she received this prompt—her sleep score—she adjusted her behavior. When you highlight important data, the right choices become clearer. When it comes to changing behaviours, sometimes all it takes is one key piece of data. As they say, “Once you see it, you can’t un-see it.” (PN’s CEO Tim Jones used the feedback he got from various lifestyle trackers to finally reduce his genetically high cholesterol levels—and built a richer, more meaningful life in the process. Read more: How This Guy Cut His Cholesterol in Half Without Drugs ) When Jan, an avid recreational cyclist, found out he could view—then demolish—the records set on local biking trails, he set to work. But as those records were destroyed, so too was his ability to ride for enjoyment. His focus on speed left him under-recovered and eventually led to burnout. If workouts have become more about the numbers and less about technique, experience, or even enjoyment, tracking is likely no longer helpful. The harder you work, the better your results. Right? Not necessarily. This belief tends to get grinders like Zak into trouble because they think they’re making progress—but really they’re just getting in their own way, even inhibiting performance and recovery. Meanwhile, there are also many people who chronically under estimate their effort and capacity, and would benefit from turning up the heat. Here, data can help us more accurately understand our own potential. Let’s look at high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an example. HIIT workouts alternate fixed periods of intense effort with fixed periods of rest. However, these fixed periods of rest are just estimates of recovery times. Heart rate data can create a more individualized picture of actual recovery needs, which may be faster or slower than you expect. Sometimes, the mind says yes but the heart says not quite yet. A good coach does more than just simply ask for more . They also help keep clients out of the unproductive “junk volume” zone, where fatigue accumulates but performance doesn’t improve (and maybe even worsens). By looking at real-time metrics of output, fatigue, and recovery, you can better understand yourself and your clients, and help keep everyone training and recovering efficiently. When you become overly reliant on data, you risk losing touch with your own sense of how you feel, whether that’s hunger and fullness levels, energy and fatigue, or something else. A relevant example is “The Great My Fitness Pal Blackout.” In January of 2019, the calorie-tracking app (with a reported 200 million subscribers!) went down for a day. Pretty minor—unless you happened to be tracking your macro and caloric intake and waiting for the app to tell you exactly how much you could eat that day… which I was. When the app wouldn’t load, I recognized the mild panic I felt was unhelpful. My overreliance on the app had disconnected me from my own internal signals, and without it, I felt adrift. Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to how energetic I feel and one of the oldest tracking technologies available: the mirror. (If you feel like you’re lost without your besties—your phone and your apps—there’s a name for that. There are also ways to develop a healthier relationship with your tech. Read more: What is nomophobia? ) Before we get to how to do the above, let’s talk about why assessing things by feel can be so important. Whether it’s body fat percentage or movement speed, even supremely motivated and capable clients will experience diminishing objective results from their training. The scale stops dropping, the number of plates you’re able to load on the bar plateaus, or— gasp —your race time even regresses. Motivation based purely on progress or other extrinsic goals 6 will fall away during these times. However, exercisers who focus on feelings of mindfulness 7 , mastery, meaning 8 , and success 9 develop a more resilient practice. They also enjoy the process more, whether that’s the process of running, lifting, winding down for a good night’s sleep, or just enjoying a meal. So, although objective data can provide essential feedback and guidance, you’ll only reap the full benefits of your practice—that is, enjoyment and results—if you maintain connection with your felt experience. And good news: You can actually use fitness trackers to calibrate and even improve your ability to accurately sense what’s happening in your body. Here are three ways to do it. Can you imagine asking someone how their vacation was and then waiting for them to look at their photos to be able to answer? That’s what it’s like when you rely purely on external data about your own experience. Whatever the metric—how far you biked, how many calories you consumed, or how fast your heart was beating—the simplest way to work mindfully with tracker data is to pause, breathe, and then tune into the powerful (if not always accurate) prediction-making powers of your brain. Once you’ve checked in with yourself, you can calibrate your self-assessment by comparing the detailed (if not always accurate) outputs of your fitness tracker. Over time, you may be able to narrow the gap between two. (Note: Don’t forget to regularly update your app. Algorithms and data sets are regularly adjusted for better predictive accuracy.) The coaches I work with regularly ask people to estimate the boundaries of their strength (such as how many reps they can do at a given weight until failure). Novices are often terrible at estimating this—and regularly off the mark by five or more reps. However, the use of objective trackers can help calibrate their understanding, and most people can reduce their margin of error dramatically. In theory, you might use fancy tools like accelerometers or blood lactate measurements, but our coaches just ask, “For a million dollars a rep, how many more reps do you think you could do?” Though there’s nothing objective about this question, most clients are able to use the prompt as a kind of shortcut to understand maximal effort. (After all, that last rep may be worth seven figures!) The question also leverages the rate of perceived exertion (RPE)—your perception of how hard you’re working—which is one of the most validated sensory-driven approaches. Not everyone is automatically good at estimating RPE, but most people can improve their skills by mapping their felt experience with occasional calibration with objective data. Trackers have components like accelerometers, GPS, and gyroscopes to sense data about speed, distance, and more. But humans are no slouches either. We have… And that’s only a partial list. You have access to an incredibly rich network of sensory information—something that technology cannot begin to touch. All of this information is fed into the powerful pattern-recognition machine of your nervous system. To continue honing your ability to use this rich network of sensory information, regularly check in with what and how you’re feeling. When you learn to calibrate your own senses with objective data, you can leverage all the cool advances in wearable tech—while still keeping your own experience front and centre.

The general benefits are well-known and seem to work for a lot of people:\n\n* **Improved Sleep Quality:** This is the big one. It can help lower core body temperature and promotes a feeling of calm, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep without morning grogginess.\n* **Calming / Anxiolytic Effects:** It acts as a neurotransmitter, which can help take the edge off anxiety and stress during the day.\n* **Collagen & Connective Tissue Support:** It's a key component of collagen, so it’s great for skin, joint, and bone health.\n* **Glutathione Precursor:** It helps the body produce glutathione, a master antioxidant.\n\n**The Surprising (and Unofficial) Side Effect**\n\nHowever, while digging through forums and anecdotal reports online, I've come across a recurring theme: **a noticeable decrease in libido / sex drive.**\n\nI want to be clear, this is **not** a common side effect listed in major clinical studies, which makes it all the more interesting to discuss from a user-experience. To my knowledge, no study has specifically examined the **relationship** between glycine intake and libido\n\n**Diving into the 'Why': The Plausible Pathways**\n\nBefore just dismissing it,  there are actually a few plausible mechanisms that could explain why this might happen in some individuals:\n\n1. **Glycine as an Inhibitory Neurotransmitter:** This is the most likely explanation. Glycine's main job in the central nervous system is to be a \"brake pedal.\" It calms things down. Sexual arousal and libido, on the other hand, require strong \"gas pedal\" signals from excitatory neurotransmitters (like dopamine). It’s possible that by boosting the body's primary \"brake\" system, Glycine inadvertently dampens the excitatory signals needed for a strong libido in some people.\n2. **The Serotonin Connection:** Some research suggests that Glycine can influence and increase serotonin levels in the brain. As many people know from the side effects of SSRI antidepressants, elevated serotonin is very frequently linked to a decreased sex drive. If Glycine is nudging serotonin levels up, it could potentially be causing a similar, though likely much milder, effect.\n3. **Indirect Hormonal Influence (More Speculative):** Glycine can have some influence on the pituitary gland. Any significant shift in hormones like prolactin could theoretically impact libido, though the evidence for this pathway is much weaker than the first two.\n\n**So, I'm turning to the collective wisdom of this sub:**\n\nI'm curious to see if the anecdotal reports hold any weight in a larger group.\n\n* Has anyone else experienced a noticeable drop in libido while taking glycine?\n* If you did, what was your dosage and when did you take it (e.g., 3g before bed)?\n* Did the effect go away if you stopped or lowered the dose?\n* Conversely, has anyone noticed **no effect** or even a **positive** one on their libido, perhaps due to the benefits of better sleep and lower stress?\n\nGlycine is fantastic for sleep. However, some experienced a potential drop in libido. This could be biologically explained by Glycine's role as a primary \"brake\" (inhibitory) neurotransmitter in the body or its potential to increase serotonin. Wondering if anyone in the community can confirm or deny this from their own experience.", "relevance_score": 2.4, "relevance_hits": ["sleep"]}

This research aims to assess the expression of EDIL3 in PH and to investigate its underlying mechanisms in the condition. Our results indicated that EDIL3 levels are elevated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), as well as in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) compared to normoxia-treated controls. Additionally, a mouse model of PH induced by SU5416 along with hypoxia (Su/Hx) also expressed elevated EDIL3 levels. We discovered that EDIL3 knockdown diminished the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanically, we identified an interaction between EDIL3 and integrin αVβ3. The regulation of PASMCs proliferation by EDIL3 was disrupted by cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide that serves as a potent and selective inhibitor of integrin αVβ3. Furthermore, recombinant EDIL3 significantly increased the level of p-ERK1/2, an effect that was blocked by cilengitide, while p-p38 and p-JNK levels remained unchanged.

This review examines the interactions between LAB and various food-grade encapsulation materials including proteins (such as whey protein, casein, zein), polysaccharides (like alginate, chitosan), and lipids (such as liposomes, W/O/W emulsions), highlighting roles of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, covalent cross-linking, and interfacial self-assembly.

The review also summarizes practical applications in hydrocolloid-rich food systems, such as yogurt, plant-based gels, and functional beverages. These applications highlight LAB's contribution to enhancing structural stability, controlled release, and nutritional functionality. Finally, key challenges are discussed, including the limited compatibility between encapsulating materials and food matrices, insufficient understanding of the interactions between exopolysaccharides and interfaces, and the need for in vivo validation.

For this, the study included 34 patients diagnosed with PPGLs. Pre-operative and postoperative serum samples were analyzed using 1D-proton NMR spectroscopy, and NMR spectral data were processed using Bruker software Topspin. The quantitative metabolic profiles were estimated using CHENOMX NMR-Suite, and multivariate data were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal PLS-DA followed by random forest (RF) classification method (a machine learning approach). The multivariate analysis revealed distinct metabolic differences between pre-operative and postoperative samples with respect to normal control (NC) samples, indicating a metabolic shift following tumor resection. RF classification, with an out-of-bag error rate of 0.186, effectively distinguished between NC, presurgery, and postsurgery groups, underscoring the distinct metabolic states in PPGL and the restorative effect of surgical intervention. Pre-operative serum profiles of PPGL patients were characterized by decreased levels of key metabolites, including glucose, citrate, amino acids (glutamine, glycine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, and alanine), histidine, myo-inositol, and creatinine, suggesting altered energy metabolism, and amino acid catabolism induced by catecholamine excess. Postsurgical profiles showed partial metabolic restoration, with significant increases in proline, glutamate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) (p < 0.01), indicating normalization involving lipid oxidation and amino acid metabolism. Although plasma metanephrines normalized postsurgery, full biochemical recovery lagged, as metabolic profiles of postoperative patients remained distinct from healthy controls. In conclusion, the present untargeted NMR metabolomics revealed significant metabolic reprogramming in PPGL patients and captured the partial normalization of metabolic pathways following tumor resection. Metabolites such as proline, glutamate, and 3-HB emerged as potential biomarkers of treatment response. These findings underscore the utility of metabolomics to identify biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, assessing postsurgical recovery, and improving our understanding of PPGL pathophysiology.", "relevance_score": 2.0685, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "leucine", "recovery"]}

Despite clinical and muscle pathology features highly suggestive of collagen VI-related dystrophy, some patients had remained without an identified causative variant in COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3. With combined muscle RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we uncovered a recurrent, de novo deep intronic variant in intron 11 of COL6A1 (c.930+189C>T) that leads to a dominantly acting in-frame pseudoexon insertion. We subsequently identified and have characterized an international cohort of 44 patients with this COL6A1 intron 11 causative variant, one of the most common recurrent causative variants in the collagen VI genes.

The Olympia contender went on to note that while he doesn’t feel old at 31 years of age, he has noticed how his body responds to junk foods when compared to his younger days. “Not being in my 20s anymore, when I start eating like s**t, I feel it pretty f*****g hard,” revealed the 2025 New York Pro winner.  To combat his cravings, Walker now opts for healthier foods to make him feel full without the nasties. “Just give me some cream of rice, some fruit, and I’m good,” he explained. “I don’t need nothing else.”  A post shared by Nick \"the Mutant\" Walker (@nick_walker39)  In the video, Walker doubled down on his love of fruit, particularly the frozen kind. “I prefer for the majority of my fruits, except bananas sometimes, I prefer frozen fruit over fresh fruit,” he shared. When it comes to bananas, The Mutant’s reluctance to freeze them likely stems from the fact that bananas can brown, losing their structure and taste during the freezing process. Still, there’s a scientific reason that he likes to freeze the rest his fruit, and it’s not just about taste. “Studies have shown that frozen fruits are actually fresher than ‘fresh,’” said Walker. And, to a large extent, the big man is correct. Science has indeed shown that freezing fruit can have a positive effect on vitamin E content while preserving the same levels of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron found in fresh fruits. This is because the nutritional value of ‘fresh’ fruit will very much depend on a number of factors such as when the fruit was harvested. Keep your diet on the right path by stocking your fridge with these freezable produce. Fresh fruit that is transported or stored for longer periods of time can lose its value whilst frozen fruits have their nutrients locked in during peak ripeness. The vitamin C level degrades in fresh fruit over time as well. But, that’s not to say biting into a fresh, juicy apple, or enjoying that succulent banana should be ‘cancelled.’ There’s also a faux pas that you can make with choosing frozen fruits: To get the most from your frozen fruit, avoid pre-sweetened options or ‘blends’ that may add hidden sugars and syrups to your eating regime. For Walker, however, frozen is the way to go. “I will take frozen blueberries over fresh, any day of the week,” he concluded, and was met with a ton of support in his IG comments. “I absolutely agree,” wrote one follower. “Frozen fruits are better 95% of the time.” Perhaps the likeminded fan knocked 5% off because of some badly frozen bananas? Either way, The Mutant’s current progress has him looking seriously peeled! To follow Nick Walker on Instagram, click here. The 2024 Bigman Pro Spain winner is coming strong into the 2025 Olympia.

Here, we developed an engineered extracellular vesicle (EV) platform for precise apelin delivery to PAH lesions, maximizing therapeutic impact. Using interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a type II transmembrane protein, we oriented the apelin peptide on the EV surface with its C-terminus fully exposed, preserving the critical binding interface for functional interaction with the apelin receptor.

This dual-engineered EVs demonstrated exceptional targeting and therapeutic efficacy in PAH models.

The protein 3C protease plays a crucial role as it blocks the virus replication. This study explores the potential of natural inhibitors, specifically Propolis compounds targeting the protein 3Cpro, which is a promising and less toxic alternative compared to the standard synthetic inhibitor, Rupintrivir.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A set of 60 propolis-derived molecules was selected and prepared for molecular docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinity to 3Cpro, then ligand-3Cpro protein interactions were visualized. A 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, then the following MD parameters were analyzed: RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonding. Binding free energies were further estimated using MM-PBSA, and per-residue energy decomposition was performed to identify key stabilizing interactions.\n\nRESULTS: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A displayed binding energies of -8.0 kcal/mol and -8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, outperforming the reference inhibitor Rupintrivir (-6.66 kcal/mol). MD simulations revealed that both ligands effectively stabilize 3Cpro, with RMSD scores of 1.02 ± 0.10 nm and 1,21 ± 0.22, respectively, and are also more stable in the pocket than Rupintrivir.

These results pave the way for the development of natural antivirals derived from Propolis and support its use as a dietary supplement for the treatment of rhinovirus infections. The chemical diversity of Propolis could limit the emergence of viral resistance.

PS and falls are prevalent in aging populations, yet their combined impact on long-term stroke risk remains underexplored, particularly in Asian cohorts. This study investigates the association between fall history and incident stroke among middle-aged and older Chinese adults with PS.\n\nMETHODS: Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2015-2018), we analyzed 4605 participants with PS (mean age: 64.8 years). Fall history was assessed by self-reported response to \"Have you fallen in the past two years?\" Stroke was physician-diagnosed via self-report. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models evaluated stroke risk, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), and biomarkers (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed robustness.\n\nRESULTS: Stroke incidence was 9.3 % among fallers and 6.7 % among non-fallers, with a P-value of 0.036. Participants with fall history exhibited a 37 % higher risk of incident stroke compared to non-fallers (adjusted OR: 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.84). The association remained consistent across age, sex, BMI, and most comorbidity subgroups, except for dyslipidemia (interaction P = 0.022). Sensitivity analyses, including multiple imputation for missing data, exclusion of adults >80 years, and removal of hip fracture cases, consistently confirmed the robustness of the findings.\n\nCONCLUSION: Fall history independently predicts stroke risk in individuals with PS, highlighting the potential of fall prevention to reduce stroke burden in this population. This study provides novel evidence of a prolonged stroke risk trajectory in Asian PS cohorts, complementing Western studies focused on short-term post-fall risks. The study has several limitations. Self-reported falls may introduce recall bias and lack mechanistic details. Unmeasured confounders such as diet and medication use constrain causal interpretation.

Due to their biological complexity and heterogeneity, rigorous analytical methods are essential to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of rAAV-based products. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as aggregation, full/empty capsid ratios, viral protein composition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) must be monitored comprehensively. While several chromatographic techniques address individual CQAs, there is a growing industrial need for techniques that enable multi-attribute analysis in a single run.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography-ultraviolet detection-reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-UV-RPLC-MS) method for the comprehensive characterization of rAAV vectors. The method enables simultaneous assessment of high molecular weight species (aggregates), capsid identity, and PTMs. In the first dimension, SEC separates intact viral particles and quantifies aggregates, followed by a targeted heart-cut of the monomeric fraction. This fraction is then subjected to RPLC for protein separation under denaturing conditions, with high-resolution MS used to identify viral proteins and their modifications. Initially optimized for rAAV8, the method was successfully extended to other rAAV serotypes, demonstrating its adaptability across serotypes. A forced degradation study under thermal stress conditions further highlighted the method's ability to monitor structural integrity and stability of the viral vectors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This study presents a novel 2D-LC-MS approach for streamlined, multi-attribute analysis of viral vector products. By combining multiple analyses into a single run, this 2D-LC-MS method can be considered as a powerful tool for comprehensive analysis of gene therapy vectors in the future.

Herein, machine learning (ML) models were built using the SARS-CoV-2 DMS data set, with the input features derived from the Rosetta-computed decomposition energy terms. To improve the performance of this physics-based model, we further incorporated local environment information (the number of residue pair-specific contacts within shells at different distances) as the input features. Alternatively, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on amino-acid sequence information as well as their physicochemical and biochemical properties was also employed, yielding predictions that achieved good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, compared to three popular protein language models, the dual-encoding CNN model demonstrated consistently superior performance on the SARS-CoV-2 DMS data set and seven additional DMS data sets for different biological properties.

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays.

Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation.

However, the (joint) performance of these assays and tools on novel variants has not been established. Transformation of the qualitative classification guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) into a quantitative Bayesian point system enables empirical validation of strength of evidence assigned to evidence criteria. Here, we derived a maximum-likelihood estimate model that converts frequentist odds ratios calculated from case-control data to proportions pathogenic and applied this model to functional assays, alone and in combination with computational tools across several domains of BRCA1. Furthermore, we defined exceptionally conserved ancestral residues (ECARs) and interrogated the performance of assays and tools at these residues in BRCA1. We found that missense substitutions in BRCA1 that fall at ECARs are disproportionately likely to be pathogenic with effect sizes similar to that of protein-truncating variants. In contrast, for substitutions falling at non-ECAR positions, concordant predictions of pathogenicity from functional assays and computational tools often fail to meet the additive assumptions of strength in ACMG guidelines. Thus, collectively, we conclude that strengths of evidence assigned by expert opinion in the ACMG guidelines are not universally applicable and require empirical validation.", "relevance_score": 1.6982, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein", "strength"]}

While it is well established that genetic mutations that disrupt the structural integrity of the DGC result in numerous muscular dystrophies, the 3D structure of the complex has remained elusive. Two recent elegant cryoEM structures of the DGC illuminate its molecular architecture and reveal the unique structural placement of sarcospan (SSPN) within the complex. SSPN, a 25 kDa tetraspanin-like protein, anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, supporting the conclusions of biochemical studies that SSPN is a core element for DGC assembly and stabilization. Here, we advance these studies by revealing that SSPN provides scaffolding in δ-sarcoglycanopathies, enabling substitution of δ-sarcoglycan by its homolog, ζ-sarcoglycan, leading to the structural integrity of the DGC and prevention of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R5. Three-dimensional modeling reveals that ζ-sarcoglycan preserves protein-protein interactions with the sarcospan, sarcoglycans, dystroglycan, and dystrophin.

This study aimed to explore the contribution of GLIPR2 to post-AMI fibrosis and its underlying mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: Serum protein levels of GLIPR2 were measured in patients with AMI. LAD ligation surgery was used to establish AMI animal models in C57BL/6 J mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-targeted knockdown of GLIPR2 was employed to investigate the effects of GLIPR2 on cardiac fibrosis, cardiac pumping function, and EndoMT after AMI in mice. In human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), GLIPR2 overexpression and knockdown via lentivirus (LV) were utilized to examine angiogenesis, migration, proliferation, and EndoMT under hypoxic conditions.\n\nRESULTS: In the serum of AMI patients, GLIPR2 expression was significantly increased.

To address this need, we developed an innovative technique utilizing immobilized H2R for the rapid identification and characterization of bioactive compounds from complex matrices. Compared with the previous screening methods, this approach can detect the binding mode of ligands on the basis of screening. In this study, the prepared H2R chromatographic column was successfully applied for kinetic interaction analysis between two specific ligands and the receptor. The bioactive compound screened and collected via the H2R column was identified as liquiritin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-IT-MS). Competitive displacement assays revealed that liquiritin competes with nizatidine and ranitidine for the same binding sites. Notably, as the concentration of famotidine in the mobile phase increased, an inverse shift in the retention time of liquiritin was observed. To elucidate this phenomenon, molecular docking simulations were performed. The results suggest that nizatidine and ranitidine compete with liquiritin for the same binding sites, reducing liquiritin-protein binding and increasing the proportion of free liquiritin, thereby causing a forward shift in the retention peak. In contrast, the acidic residues (ASP186, ASP98) of famotidine may reorganize the protein's surface charge through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, altering the electrostatic interactions of liquiritin and leading to the observed peak shift. Additionally, at higher concentrations, famotidine may form multimolecular complexes that indirectly stabilize liquiritin-protein binding. Literature review revealed that, compared to nizatidine and ranitidine, famotidine exhibits a positive regulatory effect on β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization. These findings further demonstrate that the established H2R receptor chromatography model can effectively screen bioactive components and determine their binding modes.

This study aimed to assess intestinal permeability in adolescent patients with AN by comparing serum markers Zonulin, Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and intestinal Fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) with healthy controls (HC) over time.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study on 60 female adolescent patients with AN and 36 age-matched HC. Blood samples were collected at admission to inpatient treatment, at discharge, and at a one-year follow-up. Zonulin, LBP, iFABP and inflammation marker Interleukin 6 levels were measured alongside clinical parameters. Linear mixed models were applied to assess group differences and longitudinal changes. Pearson correlations were used to explore clinical associations.\n\nRESULTS: Zonulin levels were significantly decreased in the AN group at admission and again at the follow-up compared to HC. LBP levels were consistently reduced in AN across all three time points. These alterations thus persisted despite weight recovery. No significant differences were observed in iFABP levels between the groups or over time. Zonulin and LBP positively correlated with Interleukin 6, linking gut permeability to inflammatory processes.\n\nCONCLUSION: Decreased Zonulin and LBP levels suggest reduced paracellular intestinal permeability in adolescent AN while transcellular permeability (iFABP) appears to be rather unaffected.

However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s). The DG-PSM promotes the realization of plasma separation and detection on lab-on-a-chip. We believe DG-PSM can be integrated into more detection devices to benefit mankind in remote areas and developing countries.", "relevance_score": 1.536, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "recovery"]}

Increasing evidence implicates neurotransmission deficits in the pathophysiology of SMA. In particular, alterations in neuroactive amino acids involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission have recently been identified in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMApatients and the spinal cord of SMNΔ7 mouse models. L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, plays a critical role in glutamatergic receptor signalling, influencing neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. However, it remains unclear whether SMN deficiency affects L-arginine metabolism in SMA. To address this, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to investigate whether SMN deficiency alters L-arginine homeostasis in the central nervous system of SMNΔ7 mice and in the CSF of SMA patients with varying disease severity, both before and after treatment with the SMN-inducing therapy Nusinersen. Notably, we observed significantly reduced L-arginine levels in the brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic SMA mice compared to age-matched wild-type littermates. Consistent with these findings, we revealed lower L-arginine levels in severe SMA1 patients compared to milder SMA2 and SMA3 patients and healthy controls, enhancing the translational strength of our findings. Importantly, Nusinersen-mediated SMN upregulation fully restored L-arginine homeostasis in the CSF of severe SMA1 patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a dysregulation of L-arginine in SMA and highlight a role for SMN-enhancing therapies in restoring neurochemical alterations observed in patients with this neurodegenerative disease.", "relevance_score": 1.3897, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "performance", "protein", "strength"]}

We evaluated its performance against existing molecular platforms.\n\nMETHODS: A sampling of archived Gram-negative bacteria (including Enterobacterales and non-fermenters) was included in the study. All isolates underwent testing for CTX-M ESBL by CTX-M LFA. CTX-M LFA results were compared to results from molecular methods, laboratory-developed (LD)-PCR (2013-2019) or BCID2 (2022-2023).

Recent deep learning-based DTI predictions have demonstrated promising performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) The over-reliance on the extraction of local features and insufficient learning of global features limit the model's performance. (ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human. Case studies further demonstrate that the model provides valuable insights for drug discovery.

He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28.

Delivering CBD to the lungs via a dry powder formulation could be an effective method to achieve adequate concentration and therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases.

This pipeline integrated differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis to identify key hub genes associated with tumor progression. We subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) and overall survival modeling to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these candidates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Finally, experimental validation of the prioritized hub genes was conducted via qPCR across three CRC cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29), confirming their upregulation and supporting their clinical potential.\n\nRESULTS: Our integrative pipeline prioritized five key hub genes (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) as significantly upregulated in COAD tissues compared to normal controls.

In recent decades, other genes and their allelic variants, beyond CFTR mutations, have been proposed as genetic modifiers of CF phenotype. For instance, different polymorphic β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) polymorphic variants have been reported in CF individuals and appear to influence correct receptor function. β2AR belongs to the βAR family, which includes three subtypes: β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR. These receptors are crucial G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types and serve as key modulators of cAMP production, making their function particularly relevant in CF pathophysiology. β2AR is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells, and studies revealed that it plays a crucial role in modulating CFTR activity and smooth muscle contractility through cAMP signaling. For these reasons, β2-agonists are widely used in clinical healthcare to treat patients with obstructive airway disorders, including CF.

Herein, we report the rational chemical design and synthesis of a dithiolane-incorporated lipidoid (S-DOPE) to construct an innovative LNP formulation, termed SLNP, for enhanced intracellular mRNA delivery. These chemically engineered SLNPs exploit an inherent thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, whereby the unique dithiolane moiety triggers a dynamic covalent disulfide-thiol exchange reaction with cell surface thiols. This chemically driven reaction facilitates direct cytosolic mRNA delivery, effectively bypassing endosomal entrapment, a major bottleneck for conventional LNPs. In vitro studies demonstrate that SLNP formulations achieve an 11-fold increase in mRNA transfection and translation efficiency compared to standard LNPs. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations reveal a 4.5-fold enhancement in mRNA expression and robust immune responses. SLNP-mediated vaccination at low doses elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response. Notably, SLNPs induce neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are comparable to those achieved with significantly higher doses of conventional LNPs, highlighting their substantial dose-sparing potential.
