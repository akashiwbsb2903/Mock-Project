The results showed a significant time effect of certain blood parameters and all measured oxidative stress markers independent of group allocation. This can be explained by seasonal changes over the study period. Urea and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were significantly increased in HP, which could be attributed to the high protein intake, however they remained in the normal range. UCB and FRAP were significantly lower in HP, which could be due to the metabolization of the additional protein. Women in particular showed more altered oxidative stress markers as well as reduced uric acid (UA) in the HP group, suggesting lower estrogen secretion during menopause, possibly due to decreased nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NrF2) synthesis and subsequently impaired antioxidant defense.

Despite clinical recommendations for increased protein intake to counteract muscle wasting, the outcomes have been suboptimal, suggesting that anabolic resistance should be considered in addition to nutritional support. Emerging evidence suggests that impaired mitophagy hampers anabolic processes in skeletal muscle, exacerbating muscle wasting in sepsis. Furthermore, thyroid hormone (TH), which is essential for both anabolism and mitophagy, is locally inactivated by type 3 Deiodinase (Dio3) at the onset of sepsis, potentially disrupting mitophagy and contributing to anabolic resistance. Here we demonstrate that local hypothyroidism is a key factor impairing mitophagy in skeletal muscle during early sepsis, leading to metabolic disturbances and muscle wasting. Dio3 knockdown preserves muscle mass, and ameliorates metabolic dysfunction via mitophagy promotion in sepsis models. Mechanistically, the knockdown of Dio3 triggers an upregulation of NRK2, facilitating the restoration of NAD salvage synthesis. This enhancement of NAD levels subsequently activates Sirtuins deacetylase, which in turn decreases PINK1 acetylation, preventing its proteolytic processing by OMA1. Therefore, targeting Dio3 offers a promising therapeutic approach to counteract sepsis-induced muscle wasting.", "relevance_score": 9.5624, "relevance_hits": ["anabolic", "muscle", "protein"]}

Currently, there is still a lack of relevant treatments. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a vital tool for identifying druggable targets in skeletal muscle to develop T2DM treatments.\n\nMETHODS: Potential causative genetic factors in skeletal muscle and blood causally associated with T2DM were identified by SMR analysis. Bayesian colocalisation were used to validate causality. Pleiotropic impact of drug targets was assessed using phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR). Then, targeted overexpression or knockdown of AEBP1 in mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12) and human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) further validated the functional phenotype. Protein docking, co-IP and SPR were used to demonstrate protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Both European and Asian populations revealed that AEBP1 was significantly associated with T2DM and its glycemic profile in blood and skeletal muscle, and was identified as a risk factor. Co-localisation analyses suggest that AEBP1 and T2DM originate from the same genetic variants. Meanwhile, targeted AEBP1 therapy has no potential adverse effects. Furthermore, AEBP1 was significantly expressed in in vivo and in vitro IR models and was consistent with the SMR results. Overexpression of AEBP1 further impaired insulin signalling and glucose transport mechanisms, exacerbating skeletal muscle IR. Targeting AEBP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Protein interaction experiments revealed that PI3K (p110β) is a direct target protein for AEBP1 to exert molecular functions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeting AEBP1 therapy is expected to be a pivotal approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM.", "relevance_score": 9.5169, "relevance_hits": ["muscle", "protein"]}

Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the \"black box\" nature of complex ML models.

To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038).

Upon systemic administration, liposomes must circulate in the body for extended periods to reach target tissues. A challenge arises when liposomes encounter biological fluids in vivo, where proteins and other biomolecules form a \"protein corona\" around the liposomes, which can alter their function. Despite the development of stealth liposomes, completely preventing protein corona formation remains a challenge. The presence of the protein corona can interfere with interactions between targeting ligands and tissues, potentially reducing the efficacy of targeted delivery systems.

Transcriptome sequencing revealed that LRHC may maintain cytoskeletal structure through activation of adherens junction signaling pathways and promote extracellular matrix (ECM) production through activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling pathways, thereby achieving anti-aging efficacy.. These findings confirm that LRHC can penetrate the dermis and exert anti-aging effects on skin, potentially through mechanisms mediated by adherens junction signaling pathways.

This pre-enrichment process resulted in an 8.25-fold increase in protein concentration, significantly improving ELISA sensitivity and reducing the limit of detection (LOD) by nearly an order of magnitude. The enhanced detection performance was validated in terms of accuracy, precision, and linearity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This method, which combines MIP-based protein enrichment with ELISA detection, offers a promising and cost-effective solution for enhancing ELISA performance.

Efficient targeted delivery properties of toxin proteins themselves provide important insights into the design of novel drug delivery systems.

This variant retained its cell-binding capability while exhibiting significantly reduced cytotoxicity. ELISA and molecular docking identified EGFR as the primary functional receptor of MAP30, and flow cytometry confirmed a 3-fold higher binding affinity of MAP30 to EGFR-high tumor cells (A431) compared to EGFR-low cells (HeLa). To address endosomal entrapment, we screened triterpenoid saponins and found that Saikosaponin A (SSA) enhanced the endosomal escape efficiency of MAP30ER by inducing vesicle membrane disruption. When applied to deliver Apoptin (a apoptosis-inducing protein), the MAP30ER-SSA system elevated tumor cell killing efficacy from 65 % to 90 % upon SSA co-treatment, and Western blot confirmed that it induced apoptosis through activation of caspase-3/9 and cleavage of PARP1.

In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice.

The diets consisted of seven major food categories: cereals and tubers, vegetables, meats, milk, oil, salt, and fruits. The liquid formulations for the above energy levels were prepared according to the concentration standards for special medical purpose foods (FSMPs).

The random forest model's feature importance analysis revealed that carbohydrates (33.33%) and dietary fiber (23.01%) were the most important factors for predicting tube blockage, with an AUC value of 0.91, indicating strong predictive ability.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study explores the impact of nutritional components and ingredient characteristics on tube patency and blockage risk in nasogastric pureed diets, revealing key optimization pathways for pureed diet formulations. The energy density and ingredient selection of pureed diets significantly affect tube patency. High-energy diets provide higher nutritional density but significantly increase the injection force and blockage risk. Diet formulations should be optimized by reducing high-viscosity and high-hardness ingredients such as rice and beef, using rice flour to replace rice, and milk as the liquid component. For high-energy demands, the carbohydrate and dietary fiber contents should be controlled to reduce the injection force requirements and blockage risk. The study also developed a five-dimensional blockage risk warning model based on energy, protein, fat, carbohydrate, and dietary fiber (AUC = 0.91), classifying low-, medium-, and high-risk levels. Low-risk patients (energy≤1400 kcal/d, carbohydrates≤200 g/d, protein≤70 g/d) are recommended to use homemade formulas, whereas high-risk patients (energy≥1601 kcal/d, carbohydrates≥241 g/d, protein≥86 g/d) should use FSMP for full feeding to balance nutritional supply and tube patency. The findings of this study provide both theoretical and practical guidance for optimizing diets for dysphagia patients, emphasizing that adjusting formulations can effectively balance nutritional supply and tube patency, reduce blockage risk, and prevent malnutrition in homemade pureed feed. This has significant implications for reducing nasogastric complications and ensuring the safety of medical procedures.", "relevance_score": 5.2064, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "rice", "safety"]}

These models have shown immense potential in biomedical applications, including drug discovery, protein design, and understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level. However, PLMs are typically pre-trained on residue sequences alone, with limited incorporation of structural information, presenting opportunities for further enhancement. In this paper, we propose Structure Information Injecting Tuning (SI-Tuning), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to integrate structural information into PLMs. SI-Tuning maintains the original model parameters in a frozen state while optimizing task-specific vectors for input embedding and attention maps. Structural features, including dihedral angles and distance maps, are used to derive this vector, injecting the structural information that improves model performance in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on 650M ESM-2 demonstrate the effectiveness of our SI-Tuning across multiple downstream tasks. Specifically, our SI-Tuning achieves an accuracy of 93.95% on DeepLoc binary classification, and 76.05% on Metal Ion Binding, outperforming SaProt, a large-scale pre-trained PLM with structural modeling. SI-Tuning effectively enhances the performance of PLMs by incorporating structural information in a parameter-efficient manner. Our method not only advances downstream task performance, but also offers significant computational efficiency, making it a valuable strategy for applying large-scale PLM to broad biomedical downstream applications.

This study examined the relationship between umbilical cord blood levels of angiopoietin-like protein 7 (ANGPTL7) in term neonates born to mothers with GDM and myocardial development, assessing its potential as an early predictive marker.\n\nMETHODS: The study involved 46 newborns exposed to GDM and 46 healthy controls. Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness. In the poorly-controlled GDM subgroup (GDM-A), neonates had significantly higher ANGPTL7 levels and IVS/LVPW ratio (1.19 vs. 1.03), indicating more severe myocardial abnormalities.\n\nCONCLUSION: ANGPTL7 may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy in GDM neonates by promoting insulin resistance. Monitoring ANGPTL7 levels in umbilical cord blood could help identify high-risk neonates and guide optimal glycaemic management during pregnancy. Although the sample size was small, the study offers new evidence of ANGPTL7's clinical utility.

We provide an overview of selected applications and concepts that have had a significant impact on life science research, and some that have also led to significant commercial implications. In the 1980s, the SpA promoter and signal sequence were utilized in Escherichia coli for recombinant production of various proteins, yielding product secretion to the culture medium and thereby simplifying product recovery. The five homologous Ig-binding domains of SpA gained tremendous interest in the late 1980s, largely due to the rise of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use, prompting a growing demand for effective affinity ligands to facilitate their purification. Over the years, these Ig-binding domains have been extensively investigated and re-engineered to bind proteins other than antibodies, leading in the mid-1990s to the development of the affibody affinity protein technology. Today, affibody molecules are being investigated in late-stage clinical trials as potential protein therapeutics for various indications. Finally, the cell wall anchoring regions of SpA inspired the development of a surface display system for Staphylococcus carnosus, which has emerged as a technology platform in combinatorial protein engineering for work with large peptide, antibody and affibody libraries.", "relevance_score": 5.0901, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "recovery"]}

However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation.

Despite their pivotal role in tumor progression, the molecular interactions and bioactive compounds specifically targeting these complexes remain inadequately characterized. This study presents an integrative computational pipeline combining interpretable bioinformatics, network biology, and machine learning to elucidate key molecular mechanisms and bioactive motifs associated with PCC. A curated dataset of 5000 bioactive molecules was obtained from ChEMBL, and structural motifs associated with bioactivity were identified using a genetic programming-based approach. Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Gradient Boosting classifiers were trained and cross-validated using 10-fold cross-validation to predict pIC50 values, achieving high performance (mean accuracy: 0.98, AUC >0.97). Feature importance analysis consistently identified pIC50, molecular weight (MW), lipophilicity (LogP), and hydrogen-bonding properties as primary determinants of bioactivity. PPI networks were built using STRING's experimentally validated interactions and refined using BioGRID and literature cross-validation. Network centrality analysis and community detection using the Girvan-Newman algorithm revealed MYC, MAX, and EP300 as central hubs, with associated protein modules significantly enriched for biological processes including transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, including SHAP and DALEX, were employed to elucidate the contribution of individual molecular descriptors, mechanistically elucidating compound-target interactions. Despite its robustness, this computational framework lacks experimental validation and independent external datasets. Additionally, STRING's uniform confidence scores limited edge-weight precision in network visualizations during network analyses. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates the potential of a multi-layered computational approach to deepen the understanding of MYC-driven oncogenesis in PCC. By integrating motif discovery, network biology, and interpretable machine learning, the work identifies actionable molecular signatures and critical protein targets, providing a foundation for future experimental validation and the development of targeted therapies in pheochromocytoma as well as other rare cancers.", "relevance_score": 4.2344, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enable a platform to efficiently visualize and quantify the bound-unbound states of these ligand molecules in the presence of applied harmonic forces. We investigate the unbinding of Ritonavir, XK263, and AHA001 molecules from the HIV-1 protease dimer using an all-atom Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulation that induces an external stimulus as a constant harmonic force. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from the trajectories generated by SMD simulations show insights into the free energy landscape associated with the ligand's dissociation from HIV-1 protease, including the energetic barriers and favorable interactions involved in the process. Our results show that Ritonavir, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA approved antiretroviral drug for HIV-1, has enhanced binding strength, followed by AHA001, which also shows a strong binding affinity comparable to many other FDA-approved drugs, as evidenced by the binding free energy calculations derived from Umbrella Sampling (US) simulations.

Some of the lipid interacting segments in protein sequences are intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), which may gain secondary structures upon binding. We collected experimentally annotated lipid-interacting IDRs, named membrane molecular recognition features (MemMoRFs). We used this dataset to develop and test an accurate and relatively fast sequence-based MemMoRF predictor, pLMMoRF, thereby supporting tedious and costly experimental identification of MemMoRFs. Our predictor utilizes a protein language model (pLM) which we processed to generate inputs to a deep convolutional neural network. We considered various pLMs (ESM-2, ProstT5, ProtT5 and Ankh) and applied feature selection to reduce their outputs, creating a more compact neural network model. pLMMoRF leverages the Ankh-based model, selected for its higher accuracy compared to our other models. Tests on low similarity test datasets demonstrate that pLMMoRF is more accurate than the sole current predictor of MemMoRFs, CoMemMoRFPred. Moreover, pLMMoRF has a relatively small computational footprint because of the compact network size and use of dedicated GPU nodes. This allowed us to make MemMoRF predictions for the human proteome. We analyzed these predictions and made them publicly available, facilitating an improved understanding of functions of membrane-coupled proteins.

However, previous research shows they commonly experience suboptimal intakes of energy and carbohydrate. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the causes of their poor dietary intakes. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess infantry trainees' dietary intakes and (2) explore their beliefs, barriers, and self-efficacy toward performance nutrition using the Health Belief Model (HBM).\n\nMETHODS: Participants undergoing their 17-week Australian Army Infantry Initial Employment Training (Infantry IET) were recruited. During weeks 1 and 17, self-reported dietary intakes were assessed, and four focus groups were conducted.\n\nRESULTS: Mean daily energy, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were 7864 ± 1135 kJ, 1.8 ± 0.6 g/kg, and 1.5 ± 0.3 g/kg, respectively, in week 1, and 9084 ± 2535 kJ/day, 2.2 ± 1.1 g/kg and 1.5 ± 0.2 g/kg, respectively, in week 17. Three themes and seven subthemes were developed from the focus group data, falling under the following HBM domains: Cues to Action, Perceived Barriers, and Self-Efficacy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Infantry trainees' ability to eat well for their health and performance was hindered by their limited time during their intensive training schedule, their limited access to a sufficient variety of healthy foods, and their limited self-efficacy regarding performance nutrition. They require further performance nutrition knowledge, especially in regard to adopting practical fueling and refueling strategies surrounding physical training, as well as access to a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods outside of their main mealtimes.", "relevance_score": 4.1127, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!", "relevance_score": 4.0, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

You don’t need protein shakes, but if you do want them, here’s what finally worked for me. \n\nDisclaimer: There are many causes of gut irritation, so take this with caution. I’m only focusing on gut irritation caused by shakes (big hit of protein in one go).\n\n\n🔍 Background\n\nI’ve tried so many vegan proteins (rice, pea, soy, blends) and always farted as a result. I don't have issues in with my diet normally so it makes sense the shakes were the problem.The same method could be applied to any protein source or dietary change.\n\n\n✅ Method Summary\n\nKeep FODMAP foods low (if practical) during adaptation.\n\nSlowly (4–6 weeks) increase protein shake doses so your body/gut can adapt.\n\nTake a supplement containing protease + alpha-galactosidase. This is the magic stuff! It breaks down protein and GOS carbs so reduces gas during the adaptation phase.\n\nYou won’t become dependent on it. It just helps your gut adjust. You can taper off later.\n\n\n\n📅 Protein & Supplement Ramp-Up Plan\n\n(Reference to capsule means the enzyme supplement and scoops means the number of shake scoops)\n\nWeek 1\n\n½ scoop daily\t1 capsule\t\nKeep diet simple, track symptoms.\n\nWeek 2\t\n\n¾ scoop daily\t1 capsule (test 1 day without midweek)\tIf symptoms flare, stick with enzyme.\n\nWeek 3\t\n\n1 scoop daily\t1 capsule first few days, then taper\n\tTry skipping enzyme every other day.\n\nWeek 4\t\n\n1 scoop daily (steady)\tOnly if symptoms\t\nGoal = tolerate shake enzyme-free.\n\nWeek 5\n\n1 scoop + ½ scoop second shake\t\nEnzyme with 2nd shake if needed\t\nStart gently adding 2nd shake.\n\nWeek 6\t\n\n2 × 1 scoop shakes daily\tEnzyme only if symptoms\tGoal = 2 shakes/day, enzyme-free.\n\n\n\n💡 Final Thoughts\n\nBe kind to your gut. Give it time to adjust. Patience > quick fixes.\n\nMy wife is grateful I figured it out.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf the digestion works too well, you'll need more fibre!\n\nI use rice protein as it's the lowest fodmap", "relevance_score": 4.0, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

This study applies transcriptome data to investigate shared molecular mechanisms underlying AF and OSA comorbidity and develops a robust diagnostic model to evaluate OSA risk in AF patients.\n\nMETHODS: Transcriptomic datasets for AF (GSE79768) and OSA (GSE135917) were retrieved from the the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSA and AF comorbidity were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape, and hub genes were identified with the CytoHubba plug-in. A diagnostic model was then built based on these hub genes, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in both the test and validation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using CIBERSORT.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 1,462 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for the comorbidity of AF and OSA. Five hub genes were selected: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Immunoassay infiltration analysis revealed elevated levels of activated macrophages in both OSA and AF samples. The diagnostic model we developed demonstrated excellent predictive performance in the validation set.\n\nCONCLUSION: We identified five hub genes common to both OSA and AF: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG.

As LNPs consist of different lipids, the lipid composition determines key properties of these particles. This study examines how lipid composition, especially helper and PEG-lipids, and RNA cargo (siRNA and mRNA) affect LNP performance in pulmonary delivery. By comparing two different helper and two different PEG-lipids, we assessed the impact on fusogenicity and endosomal escape, in vitro transfection efficiency, and subsequently protein corona formation. Their in vitro performance was assessed in the air-liquid interface (ALI) cell culture model, a sophisticated in vitro model of the lungs. Our results demonstrated that transfection efficiency and stability differ between the helper lipids DOPE and DSPC, depending on the RNA cargo. These differences can be attributed to the structural differences of the lipids and the different properties of the RNA molecules. Our investigations further demonstrated successful mucus penetration of all LNPs and 24-42 % gene silencing in vitro. We also explored mucus proteins/LNP interactions in human lung mucus, finding distinct protein corona formation for DSPC- and DOPE-containing LNPs.

Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models.

These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway.

The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest.

Pre- and post-intervention assessments included QoL perception, clinical variables, serum biochemical markers, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity.\n\nRESULTS: The CTG showed improvement in the perception of general QoL (20.0%) and in the physical (12.7%) and social (10.1%) domains. Significant positive correlations were observed between QoL variables with interleukin- 4 (IL-4), IL-10, IL-13, IL-33, Fibroblast growth factor- 21 (FGF-21), bone morphogenetic protein- 4 (BMP4), irisin, and BAT activity, alongside negative correlations with IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, c reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and incretin hormones at baseline and/or in the Δ% changes induced by training.\n\nCONCLUSION: CT improves the perception of general QoL and the physical and social domains of individuals with overweight-related T2DM. Baseline and in the Δ% of CT change, QoL components are related with several clinical, hormonal, inflammatory, and pro-thermogenic/anti-inflammatory markers, besides BAT increased activity.", "relevance_score": 3.6093, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "quality", "strength"]}

The objective of this study was to assess the anti-wrinkle and anti-aging effects of Arazyme in skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts subjected to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and oxidative stress. Keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and fibroblasts (CCD-986sk) were exposed to UVB (15 mJ/cm²) radiation or oxidative stress induced by 2 mM 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), followed by treatment with Arazyme (0.1-0.5 μM) for 24 h. The effects of Arazyme were compared to those of individual treatments with papain, trypsin, or retinol, which served as reference compounds. Key parameters examined included the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13), collagen synthesis, and cellular senescence markers (LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53). Additionally, the impact of Arazyme on cellular signaling pathways, including ERK, JNK, and NF-κB, was assessed. Arazyme significantly suppressed UVB-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells compared to other treatments. In UVB-exposed fibroblasts, Arazyme reduced both mRNA and protein levels of MMPs, while also enhancing procollagen concentration and collagen gene expression. Furthermore, Arazyme inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. In AAPH-stimulated HaCaT cells, Arazyme significantly attenuated the expression of senescence-related markers, including LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53, and decreased the proportion of senescence-positive cells in fibroblasts. Our in vitro findings suggest that Arazyme may help attenuate UVB- and oxidative stress-induced markers of skin aging, indicating its potential as a candidate for further investigation in anti-aging skincare research.", "relevance_score": 3.4246, "relevance_hits": ["collagen", "dose", "protein"]}

The intestinal transport of peptides in these digests was studied using a model of Caco-2 simulated intestinal epithelial layer. Results suggest that treatment with digests of oxidized MPs not only induces ROS and inflammatory stress of Caco-2 cells (evidenced by increased ROS levels, increased mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, and decreased enzyme activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx), but also negatively affects cell viability. Moreover, protein oxidation altered peptide transport characteristics across the Caco-2 monolayer, resulting in lower permeability of bioactive peptides.

Studying ncRNA-protein interactions (NPI) can help to explore a wide range of biological features and related diseases. Traditional NPI research methods often require expensive equipment, a lot of time and labor. With the abundant samples accumulated from traditional experiments, remarkable progress has been made in the study of NPI by computational methods. Heterogeneous graph neural network is a deep learning method that synthesizes heterogeneous types of data as well as network topology. In this study, we propose an NPI-HetGNN model for NPI prediction based on heterogeneous graph neural networks. Firstly, initial features are constructed by integrating the sequence properties of ncRNA and protein data as well as the topology of heterogeneous connections. Then, the multilevel homogeneous subgraph is obtained and its semantic information is aggregated by metapath walking. At the same time, the homogeneous node information is fused within the subgraph metapath. To enhance feature extraction ability of the network, an energy-constrained self-attention module is introduced. Due to the lack of wet lab validation conditions, this study adopts computational verification. The performance of the NPI-HetGNN model on four benchmark datasets is experimentally verified. Ablation experiments also confirmed the comprehensiveness and validity of our model design. The experimental results show that comparing with six state-of-the-art methods, our NPI-HetGNN achieves very satisfactory results on all four datasets.", "relevance_score": 3.2013, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

By briefly limiting blood supply to the limbs, blood flow restriction (BFR) training is a new and widely used rehabilitation technique that improves muscle strength and endurance. In the context of postoperative recovery after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it has recently drawn a lot of attention. The purpose of this study is to assess how well postoperative continuous passive motion (CPM) and preoperative BFR training can enhance rehabilitation results for older patients having total knee arthroplasty. If successful, this strategy could provide a novel supplement to traditional rehabilitation methods for this population.\n\nMETHODS: This study is a randomized controlled trial comprising 160 TKA patients, who will be randomly allocated to either the combined intervention group or the CPM group, with 80 individuals in each cohort. All patients will have standard preoperative treatment. The intervention group will also undergo preoperative BFR training twice daily for 2-3 days before surgery, in conjunction with postoperative CPM therapy. Joint range of motion (ROM), visual analog scale (VAS) score, activities of daily living (ADL) score, hospital for special surgery (HSS) knee score, postoperative swelling (change in knee joint circumference), C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and 30-s chair stand test (30s-CST) performance are among the outcome measures. At baseline, on postoperative day 1, day 5, month 1, and month 3, data will be gathered.\n\nDISCUSSION: This study introduces an innovative rehabilitation approach that, to our knowledge, uniquely integrates preoperative blood flow restriction training with postoperative continuous passive motion in patients having total knee arthroplasty. This combined method aims to use the muscle-building benefits of BFR along with the movement-supporting benefits of CPM, which could lead to faster recovery and better strength improvement. If a short-term solution is effective, it will be more effectively implemented in hospitals.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: The Ethics Committee of the Third Bethune Hospital of Jilin University accepted this study, with reference number (2024) Clinical Research Application No. 2024112815, on November 28, 2024.

Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs.", "relevance_score": 3.1367, "relevance_hits": ["amino", "safety"]}

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving BP control (<140/90 mmHg). The co-primary endpoints included mean reductions in mean sitting SBP (msSBP), mean sitting DBP (msDBP), and mean sitting pulse pressure (msPP) at week 8. Secondary outcomes assessed dose-dependent BP reduction.\n\nRESULTS: BP control was achieved in 94.9% of patients in the Sac-Val group versus 69.2% in the control group ( P  = 0.03). Sac-Val significantly reduced msPP (-6.05 mmHg, P  = 0.008) and showed a trend toward greater msSBP reduction ( P  = 0.06). The 400 mg dose resulted in the greatest BP reduction, particularly for msPP ( P  = 0.034).

Sacsin deficiency leads to disruption of intermediate filament and mitochondrial networks. S100B, a multifunctional brain-enriched protein, exhibits protective neuroprotective functions that include chaperone activity and interactions with filament proteins and mitochondria. In this study, we used an established astroglial C6 cell model of ARSACS to investigate the potential compensatory effects of S100B on sacsin loss with respect to neurofilament integrity and mitochondrial morphological and functional hallmarks. Our results demonstrate that sacsin deletion induces S100B upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels, with the S100B protein colocalizing with perinuclear nestin aggregates and filamentous mitochondria networks. Genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibition of S100B exacerbate filament protein aggregation and mitochondrial defects, while supplementation with exogenous recombinant S100B improves ARSACS hallmarks, including decreased nestin aggregates.

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation.

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes.

The type of combat sport, length of the fight camp, and time between weigh-in and competition are factors influencing nutritional and weight cut strategies. The following 16 points constitute the Position Statement of the Society; the Research Committee has approved them. 1. Combat sports have differing weight categories, official weigh-in times, and competition frequencies, influencing the nutritional and weight cut strategies for training and competition. 2. As the duration of a combat match increases, >4 min, contribution of the aerobic system can rise to >70%, yet anaerobic alactic pathways and anaerobic glycolytic pathways support high-output bursts. 3. During the off camp/general preparation phase, athletes should maintain a weight ranging 12% to 15% above the weight division requirement. 4. Supplements including creatine, beta-alanine, beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate, and caffeine have been shown to enhance performance and/or recovery during preparation phases, competition, and post-competition. 5. During fight camp, strategic decreases in calorie intake are necessary for an efficient longitudinal weight descent. Individual caloric needs can be determined using indirect calorimetry or validated equations such as Mifflin St. Jeor or Cunningham. 6. Protein should be prioritized during longitudinal weight descents to preserve lean body mass, and the timely delivery of carbohydrates supports training demands. Macronutrients should not drop below the following: carbohydrates 3.0-4.0 g/kg, protein 1.2-2.0 g/kg, and fat 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg/day. 7. Suitable losses in body mass range from 6.7% at 72 h, 5.7% at 48 h, and 4.4% at 24 h, prior to weigh-in. 8. Sodium restriction and water loading are effective for inducing polyuria and acute water loss. 9. During fight week, water-bound glycogen stores can be depleted through exercise and carbohydrate restriction, facilitating a 1% to 2% loss in body mass, with equivalent losses from a low-fiber intake of <10 g/day for 4 days. 10. During fight week, acute water loss strategies, including sauna, hot water immersion, and mummy wraps, can be used effectively with appropriate supervision (optimally ~2-4% of body mass within 24 h of weigh-in). 11.

This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes.

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development.

Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen.

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach.

Evidence supports that enhanced recovery pathways (erps) can improve perioperative outcomes. However, few studies have demonstrated successful implementation of an ERP for LEAB. The goal of this study was to demonstrate the successful implementation of an ERP in a complex patient population undergoing LEAB, including elective, urgent, or emergent procedures with the goal of decreasing length of stay (LOS) and morbidity for patients undergoing these procedures at our institution.\n\nMETHODS: Multistakeholder meetings with representatives from all vascular surgery practice sites in the Northwestern Medicine system were conducted to review current evidence-based practices and finalize an ERP for patients undergoing LEAB. Pathway elements included standardized patient education, minimal perioperative fasting with preoperative carbohydrate loading, opioid-sparing analgesia, and early postoperative diet and mobilization. The ERP was initiated in February 2022 as a pilot at a single institution. At 20 months, patient data and process and outcome measures were abstracted from the medical record and validated by four independent reviewers for univariate analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Over the 20-month study period, 112 patients underwent LEAB. Process measures were tracked to determine compliance with the ERP. Patients had to receive >70% of the pathway elements to be considered part of the ERP (n = 60). If patients missed >30% of the elements, they were analyzed as traditional pathway (n = 52). There were no significant differences in patient demographics, body mass index, or hemoglobin a1c. ERP patients were more likely to be elective (76.7% vs 48.1%; P = .0004) and for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (76.7% vs 48.1%; P = .001) and less likely to be urgent or emergent. No significant difference was observed in frequency of infrageniculate bypass target or operative duration. Compliance with 10 perioperative process measures ranged from 28% to 98% in the ERP group. Compliance was most successful with preoperative education (81.6%), chlorhexidine wash (80.0%), postoperative mobilization (90.0%), early solid diet (98.3%), and postoperative opioid sparing strategies (98.3%). Challenges included preoperative acetaminophen (28.3%), carbohydrate load (33.8%), and postoperative protein supplementation (28.3%). Notably, ERP patients demonstrated significantly reduced total LOS (7.8 days vs 13.6 days; P = .014), postoperative LOS (6.0 days vs 11.0 days; P = .0058), and unplanned reoperations (10.0% vs 28.9%; P = .015) when compared with traditional pathway patients. ERP patients trended toward fewer unplanned readmissions (13.3% vs 26.9%; P = .095).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that an ERP for LEAB is feasible in both elective and nonelective settings, although compliance with the ERP individual elements was more challenging for patients undergoing procedures for emergent or urgent indications. Patients undergoing ERP had improved compliance with process measures, reduced LOS, and fewer unplanned reoperations. Our results highlight the benefits of ERP for LEAB and the complex vascular surgery population and some of the potential barriers worth considering in this patient population.", "relevance_score": 2.2565, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "recovery"]}

AS is a chronic inflammatory vascular disease that may be aggravated by PET-MPs. By integrating network toxicology, molecular docking, and transcriptome analysis, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1), and protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type C (PTPRC) were identified as core interaction genes between PET and AS. Through bio-enrichment analysis, we discovered that the toxicity of PET is primarily associated with the cascade reaction of vascular inflammation and abnormal macrophage activation. Molecular docking experiments confirmed a strong binding affinity between PET and these targets (<-5.0 kcal/mol). In vitro results showed that PET significantly increased the mRNA levels of TNF-α, CXCR4, CX3CR1, and PTPRC, triggering an inflammatory response and causing chemokine receptor dysfunction. In an AS mouse model, increased aortic plaque area and aortic valve collagen deposition were observed, along with elevated expression of core target genes' mRNA, even without direct exposure to PET-MPs, exhibiting effects consistent with those seen in vitro. Collectively, these studies suggest that PET can induce inflammatory responses and disrupt immune system balance by regulating the expression levels of TNF, CXCR4, CX3CR1, and PTPRC, thus promoting the progression of atherosclerotic diseases. This paper provides the first comprehensive investigation into the impact and mechanisms of microplastics on AS, demonstrating how PET contributes to its development and establishing a basis for identifying new therapeutic targets for cardiovascular diseases linked to microplastics.", "relevance_score": 2.246, "relevance_hits": ["collagen", "mps", "protein"]}

In the classical medical text Taiping Shenghui Fang, it was recorded for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) characterized by Qi stagnation and blood stasis. Its major chemical constituents include curcumin and Zedoary Turmeric Oil (ZTO). While curcumin has been extensively studied for its pharmacological activities, the therapeutic potential and mechanism of ZTO in HCC remain insufficiently understood.\n\nAIM: ZTO is a volatile oil fraction extracted from Curcumae Rhizoma, and preliminary studies have suggested its potential anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effects. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of ZTO against HCC through an integrated approach combining network pharmacology and experimental validation.\n\nMETHODS: An H22 xenograft tumor model was established to evaluate the in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of ZTO. The antiproliferative effects of ZTO on HCC cells were assessed in vitro using MTT and colony formation assays. The synergistic effects of ZTO and sorafenib were evaluated using MTT and tumor sphere-forming assay. The chemical constituents of ZTO were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Potential targets of ZTO and HCC were retrieved from public databases, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using the STRING database. Key hub targets were identified using CytoNCA, CytoHubba, and MCODE, followed by molecular dynamics simulations and molecular docking. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database. Following network pharmacology predictions of ZTO's potential mechanism against HCC, we systematically validated these computational findings through experiments in vitro and in vivo. Finally, the pharmacokinetic study of the four active components (curcumol, β-elemene, germacrone, and curdione) in ZTO was conducted using GC-MS.\n\nRESULTS: ZTO significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft model. In vitro, ZTO suppressed the proliferation of HCC cells, and it exhibited a synergistic effect when combined with sorafenib. A total of 174 overlapping targets between ZTO and HCC were identified. Among them, EGFR, p53 and Bcl-2 were recognized as key targets. The major compounds and target proteins had a good binding ability in molecular docking and molecular dynamics. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggested that ZTO may regulate apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and migration through the EGFR/p53/Bcl-2 signaling axis. Additionally, pathways associated with stem cell pluripotency were significantly enriched. Subsequent experimental validation confirmed that ZTO promoted apoptosis, induced G1-phase arrest, and inhibited cell migration via the EGFR/p53/Bcl-2 axis. Furthermore, ZTO reduced the size of HCC tumor spheres in a dose-dependent manner and downregulated the expression of stemness-related markers, including CD44, CD133, Oct-4, SOX2, and Nanog, both in vitro and in vivo, potentially through modulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that curcumol and curdione exhibited higher bioavailability compared to β-elemene and germacrone.\n\nCONCLUSION: Through an integrated approach combining network pharmacology and experimental validation, this study demonstrates that ZTO exerts anti-HCC effects by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration, inducing apoptosis, and causing G1-phase cell cycle arrest, primarily through modulation of the EGFR/p53/Bcl-2 signaling axis. In addition, ZTO significantly suppresses cancer stemness in HCC by downregulating key stemness-related markers. Finally, the pharmacokinetic study showed curcumol and curdione have higher bioavailability and faster absorption than β-elemene and germacrone. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into the anti-HCC activity of ZTO and offer a theoretical foundation for its future clinical application.", "relevance_score": 2.2446, "relevance_hits": ["bioavailability", "dose", "protein"]}

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), commonly found in fermented foods, have taken on a dual role-as both passive encapsulation targets and active delivery carriers-forming a conceptual basis for the development of next-generation food delivery systems. This review examines the interactions between LAB and various food-grade encapsulation materials including proteins (such as whey protein, casein, zein), polysaccharides (like alginate, chitosan), and lipids (such as liposomes, W/O/W emulsions), highlighting roles of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, covalent cross-linking, and interfacial self-assembly. Moreover, four emerging LAB-based delivery systems are classified: (i) surface adsorption via non-covalent interactions, (ii) intracellular loading driven by membrane transport or biosynthesis, (iii) co-encapsulation in hydrogels and emulsions, as well as (iv) engineered LAB capable of in situ synthesis and targeted release. The review also summarizes practical applications in hydrocolloid-rich food systems, such as yogurt, plant-based gels, and functional beverages. These applications highlight LAB's contribution to enhancing structural stability, controlled release, and nutritional functionality. Finally, key challenges are discussed, including the limited compatibility between encapsulating materials and food matrices, insufficient understanding of the interactions between exopolysaccharides and interfaces, and the need for in vivo validation.

The Chuanhong Zhongfeng (CHZF) Capsule, developed by national medical master Jixue Ren, has been clinically proven to promote neurological function recovery, reduce disability rates, and improve long-term prognosis in patients with cerebral infarction. However, the specific targets and potential mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate, for the first time, the potential targets of CHZF Capsule in treating ACI and improving long-term prognosis, thereby providing direction for future research on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) compounds in ACI prevention and treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06874140).\n\nMETHODS: The study focused on identifying unique differential proteins in ACI patients treated with CHZF Capsule. Twenty ACI patients were divided into a medication group (CHZ) and a control group (DZZ) based on CHZF Capsule administration. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using 4D label-free proteome quantification technology to identify differential proteins between the groups. Functional enrichment analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO) classification and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, was conducted to determine enrichment trends related to differential proteins. Hierarchical clustering was employed to identify relevant pathways enriched in each group based on P-values from the enrichment analysis. The STRING (v.11.5) protein interactions network database was utilized to obtain differential protein interactions, corresponding target proteins, and major related pathways. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) was subsequently applied to validate the selected target proteins. Finally, chord diagrams and ROC curves were plotted for visualization and analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Mass spectrometry analysis identified 1400 proteins, of which 1360 were quantitatively comparable. Using a P-value < 0.05 and change thresholds of > 1.5 for significant up-regulation and < 1/1.5 for significant down-regulation, 63 differential proteins were identified (27 upregulated and 36 downregulated). Cluster analysis revealed that Q4 (>2.0) was most closely associated with the complement and coagulation cascade pathway (hsp04610). Six proteins involved in acute inflammatory responses and immune processes were validated through PRM experiments: Complement factor H-related protein (CFHR) 4, Mannose-binding lectin protein (MBL) 2, Orosomucoid (ORM) 1, ORM2, Vascular non-inflammatory factor (VNN) 1, and Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) -A. Chord plots and ROC curve analysis suggested the following order of biomarker sensitivity: CFHR4 > MBL2 > VNN1 > ORM1 = ORM2 > HLA-A.\n\nCONCLUSION: The observed changes in these six proteins in ACI patients may serve as indicators of long-term prognosis.

Of the five different UBQLN genes in humans, UBQLN2 is the most highly expressed in the nervous system and muscle tissue and has been linked to multiple neurodegenerative diseases. In particular, point mutations of UBQLN2 cause an X-linked, dominant form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), ALS with frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD), or FTD. Failed protein degradation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS and FTD; however, it is not clear exactly how ALS/FTD-associated UBQLN2 mutations contribute to pathogenesis. Recent studies have revealed the complexity of UBQLN2 biology and allow deeper understanding as to how UBQLN2 dysfunction may contribute to neurodegenerative disease. UBQLN2 is necessary for mitochondrial protein degradation and for regulating mitochondrial turnover, both of which are essential for motor neurons and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS. Stress granule (SG) formation and regulation are also affected by UBQLN2 mutations, and their dysregulation may contribute to the toxic protein aggregation and SG changes observed in neurodegenerative disease.

NHANES data (n = 9119) were analyzed to examine the association between serum PFOS levels and CKD prevalence. Network toxicology identified PFOS-related target genes, which were further refined through protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and validated using the GSE32591 dataset. A diagnostic model was constructed, and molecular docking and in vivo studies were performed to verify gene-compound interactions and biological effects. Coremine Medical was used to identify traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) candidates targeting key genes. Serum PFOS levels were significantly associated with CKD, showing a U-shaped dose-response. Four hub genes-ALB, PTGS2, AKT1, and IGF1-were identified and used to develop a diagnostic model with excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.96). Molecular docking confirmed stable PFOS-protein interactions. PFOS exposure in mice led to dose-dependent renal tubular injury, elevated NGAL and KIM-1 levels, and PI3K-AKT pathway activation. Astragalus membranaceus, identified through TCM screening, exhibited strong binding to the target proteins and may have therapeutic potential.

In this study we report the molnupiravir and nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparisons from the RECOVERY trial. In each comparison, participants aged 18 years and older were randomly allocated (1:1) to the relevant antiviral (5 days of molnupiravir 800 mg twice daily or 300 mg nirmatrelvir and 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) in addition to usual care, or to usual care alone. The molnupiravir comparison was conducted at 75 hospitals in the UK, two in Nepal, and two in Indonesia; the nirmatrelvir-ritonavir comparison was conducted at 32 hospitals in the UK. Participants could take part in both comparisons. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, and secondary outcomes were time to discharge alive from hospital and progression to invasive ventilation or death. Analysis was by intention to treat. Both comparisons were stopped because of low recruitment.

More than three-quarters of participants were vaccinated and had antispike antibodies at randomisation, and more than two-thirds were receiving other SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. In the molnupiravir comparison, 74 (17%) participants allocated to molnupiravir and 79 (17%) allocated to usual care died within 28 days (hazard ratio [HR] 0·93 [95% CI 0·68-1·28], p=0·66).

The multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein disulfide isomerase A1 (PDIA1) shows a protective increase in expression levels in human and mouse non-COPD smokers. However, this increase slows with aging and disease progression, while increase in glutathione S-transferase π1 (GSTP1) does not. PDI has redox sensitive cysteine residues that can become S-glutathionylated (PDI-SSG) which compromise both isomerase and chaperone activity. Oxidized PDIA1 levels progressively rise with age in the lungs of murine non-smokers, with an even greater increase in smokers. To investigate whether an increased oxidized-to-native PDIA1 ratio (PDI-SSG/PDI-SH) contributes to the depletion of alveolar epithelial type 2 progenitor cells in COPD, we used the type-2-like cell line MLE12. High doses of cigarette smoke (CS) induced elevated oxidized PDIA1 levels, while a redox-refractory PDIA1 variant maintained a lower PDI-SSG/PDI-SH. Upon CS exposure, PDIA1 was S-glutathionylated by GSTP1 and predominantly localized at the ER-mitochondria interface. This mitochondrial proximity was prevented by pharmacological or genetic GSTP1 inhibition. When localized at the ER-mitochondria interface, S-glutathionylated PDIA1 decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), facilitated mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, decreased mitochondrial respiration and triggered cytochrome c (Cyt c) release, followed by caspase-3 activation. Isolated mitochondrial studies confirmed that PDI-SSG trigger these apoptotic signals whereas native PDI does not. Our findings indicate that GSTP1-mediated S-glutathionylation of PDIA1 drives pro-apoptotic intraorganellar signaling by altering its ER distribution. Overexpression of a redox-refractory PDIA1 variant restored MMP and reduced Cyt c release, suggesting that a lower S-glutathionylated-to-native PDIA1 ratio is protective. These findings highlight a threshold-dependent regulation of PDIA1-SSG/PDIA1-SH redox signaling. We propose that the simultaneous inability to maintain high PDIA1 levels and the age-associated increase in its S-glutathionylated form in smokers accelerates AEC2 depletion and exhaustion, thereby contributing to emphysema progression.", "relevance_score": 1.8335, "relevance_hits": ["protein"]}

The protein 3C protease plays a crucial role as it blocks the virus replication. This study explores the potential of natural inhibitors, specifically Propolis compounds targeting the protein 3Cpro, which is a promising and less toxic alternative compared to the standard synthetic inhibitor, Rupintrivir.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A set of 60 propolis-derived molecules was selected and prepared for molecular docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinity to 3Cpro, then ligand-3Cpro protein interactions were visualized. A 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, then the following MD parameters were analyzed: RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonding. Binding free energies were further estimated using MM-PBSA, and per-residue energy decomposition was performed to identify key stabilizing interactions.\n\nRESULTS: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A displayed binding energies of -8.0 kcal/mol and -8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, outperforming the reference inhibitor Rupintrivir (-6.66 kcal/mol). MD simulations revealed that both ligands effectively stabilize 3Cpro, with RMSD scores of 1.02 ± 0.10 nm and 1,21 ± 0.22, respectively, and are also more stable in the pocket than Rupintrivir. These ligands also reduced RMSF, SASA, and Rg scores. MM-PBSA calculations showed more favorable binding energies for Rutin (-35.65 kcal/mol) and Retusapurpurin A (-31.59 kcal/mol) compared to Rupintrivir (-25.44 kcal/mol). Per-residue decomposition further revealed strong energetic contributions from catalytic site residues (His40, Glu71, and Cys147), especially in the Rutin complex.\n\nCONCLUSION: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A are promising inhibitors targeting 3Cpro, exhibiting elevated potential efficacy compared to Rupintrivir. These results pave the way for the development of natural antivirals derived from Propolis and support its use as a dietary supplement for the treatment of rhinovirus infections.

Here, we tested whether medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs), potent ligands of human serum albumin (HSA), could be used as binding competitors of PBUTs to increase their removal during a hemodialysis session.\n\nMETHODS: A simulated hemodialysis session was performed using bovine blood spiked with PBUTs in the presence of various MCFAs. Blood was sampled serially to measure the concentrations of PBUTs indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (p-CS).\n\nRESULTS: The binding of MCFAs to HSA was investigated in silico and using fluorescent probe displacement. The free fraction of IS and p-CS were measured after ultrafiltration of HSA solutions and uremic plasma in the presence of MCFAs (0.25-3 mmol/L). Among the four MCFAs tested, octanoate and decanoate were the most prone to interact with HSA Sudlow site II, one of two main binding sites on HSA. The in vitro incubation of HSA solutions and uremic plasma with MCFAs increased the free fraction of IS and p-CS. The per-dialytic infusion of octanoate significantly improved the fractional removal of p-CS from 38% to 88% and IS from 36% to 91%.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: MCFAs can effectively compete with PBUTs for binding to HSA.

In this review, we aimed to decipher the complications associated with the PTP1B enzyme and the design strategies used by various research groups to develop small-molecule inhibitors, emphasising the structure-activity relationship of small molecules synthesized for this target. This review also delineates the molecular features, which will aid in designing rational approaches and foster further research into this target of type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "relevance_score": 1.779, "relevance_hits": ["bioavailability", "protein"]}

Due to their biological complexity and heterogeneity, rigorous analytical methods are essential to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of rAAV-based products. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as aggregation, full/empty capsid ratios, viral protein composition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) must be monitored comprehensively. While several chromatographic techniques address individual CQAs, there is a growing industrial need for techniques that enable multi-attribute analysis in a single run.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography-ultraviolet detection-reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-UV-RPLC-MS) method for the comprehensive characterization of rAAV vectors. The method enables simultaneous assessment of high molecular weight species (aggregates), capsid identity, and PTMs. In the first dimension, SEC separates intact viral particles and quantifies aggregates, followed by a targeted heart-cut of the monomeric fraction. This fraction is then subjected to RPLC for protein separation under denaturing conditions, with high-resolution MS used to identify viral proteins and their modifications. Initially optimized for rAAV8, the method was successfully extended to other rAAV serotypes, demonstrating its adaptability across serotypes. A forced degradation study under thermal stress conditions further highlighted the method's ability to monitor structural integrity and stability of the viral vectors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This study presents a novel 2D-LC-MS approach for streamlined, multi-attribute analysis of viral vector products. By combining multiple analyses into a single run, this 2D-LC-MS method can be considered as a powerful tool for comprehensive analysis of gene therapy vectors in the future. Potential applications include real-time in-process control, comparability studies, stability testing, support during process development for aggregate or PTM profiling, and drug substance or product characterization.", "relevance_score": 1.7789, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "quality", "safety"]}

RCPM selectively targeted CDDP-resistant A549 (A549R) cells, efficiently accumulating within tumors. Exhibiting exceptional photothermal (PT) properties, RCPM facilitated PT-induced tumor ablation. Within the tumor microenvironment, RCPM underwent degradation, releasing high concentrations of V, Fe, and CDDP. The liberated V and Fe ions catalyzed the Fenton reaction, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing ferroptosis. Simultaneously, these metal ions synergistically suppressed the expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), glutathione (GSH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), effectively disrupting DNA repair pathways, preventing CDDP inactivation, and enhancing its cytotoxicity against A549R tumors. Furthermore, RCPM demonstrated complete and rapid renal clearance, ensuring excellent biosafety and strong clinical translational potential.

Angiogenesis plays a critical role in neurological recovery during cerebral ischemia. Rosavin is the main active ingredient of Rhodiola rosea for ischemic stroke treatment.\n\nPURPOSE: The study investigates the neuroprotective effects of Rosavin on ischemic stroke rats through activating HIF-1α signaling.\n\nMETHODS: In vivo studies, MCAO/IR model was employed and treatment with Rosavin, and the concentration of Rosavin in brain tissue was determined using LC-MS/MS at different time points. After 7 days of treatment, mNSS were used to assess the degree of neurological deficits in rats for evaluating the neuroprotective effects of Rosavin. MRI was used to measure cerebral infarct volume, and the Morris water maze was employed to evaluate spatial learning and memory abilities. IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR, NeuN, Bax and Bcl-2 was detected by Western blotting. In vitro studies, the effects of Rosavin on angiogenesis were assessed using OGD/R-induced HUVEC model. Moreover, Network pharmacology was used to predict the potential mechanisms of Rosavin. To investigate Rosavin protects against MCAO/IR-induced neurological damage via HIF-1α signaling, rats were treated with the HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1. After 7 days, Western blotting and RT-qPCR were used to detect the expression levels of NeuN, HIF-1α, VEGFA, and EPO in the ischemic cortical brain tissue. Immunofluorescence staining was performed to evaluate the expression of HIF-1α, VEGFA, CD31, and NeuN.\n\nRESULTS: Rosavin (ip.) was detectable in the rat brain, with peak concentration achieved at 20 min post-administration. Rosavin significantly reduced cerebral infarct volume and mNSS scores in MCAO/IR rats. Additionally, Rosavin decreased the escape latency and increased the number of platform crossings in the Morris water maze test. In ischemic brain tissue, Rosavin reduced the number of apoptotic cells and Bax expression while increasing Bcl-2, NeuN, and CD31. Network pharmacology analysis identified 174 potential therapeutic targets of Rosavin for ischemic stroke, with enrichment analysis suggesting that it activated HIF-1α signaling. Rosavin upregulated HIF-1α protein and nuclear localization, and VEGF and EPO in the ischemic cortical brain tissue. In vitro studies showed that Rosavin inhibited OGD/R-induced tube formation in HUVECs and increased CD31, VEGFA, and EPO. These effects of Rosavin were abolished by HIF-1α inhibitor YC-1.

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays. RIP and MeRIP assays were conducted to investigate the interaction between YTHDF1 and TOP2A mRNA. Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation. Additionally, YTHDF1 knockdown reduced TOP2A protein expression and mitigated hypoxia-induced PASMCs dysfunction, while TOP2A overexpression reversed these protective effects. Mechanistically, TOP2A activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, driving PASMCs proliferation and migration.

Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 2(GLIPR2) has been reported to be associated with EndoMT, but whether it can regulate cardiac fibrosis is unknown. This study aimed to explore the contribution of GLIPR2 to post-AMI fibrosis and its underlying mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: Serum protein levels of GLIPR2 were measured in patients with AMI. LAD ligation surgery was used to establish AMI animal models in C57BL/6 J mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-targeted knockdown of GLIPR2 was employed to investigate the effects of GLIPR2 on cardiac fibrosis, cardiac pumping function, and EndoMT after AMI in mice. In human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), GLIPR2 overexpression and knockdown via lentivirus (LV) were utilized to examine angiogenesis, migration, proliferation, and EndoMT under hypoxic conditions.\n\nRESULTS: In the serum of AMI patients, GLIPR2 expression was significantly increased. In mice with AMI, GLIPR2 knockdown reversed EndoMT, attenuated heart fibrosis, and partially restored ventricular pumping function. In a hypoxic cell model, GLIPR2 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, migration, neovascularization, and EndoMT, whereas GLIPR2 knockdown inhibited these processes. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing and recovery studies identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein (PDGFRL)/AKT/mTOR pathway as a critical regulator of GLIPR2-mediated EndoMT.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: GLIPR2 promotes cardiac fibrosis repair by regulating EndoMT through the PDGFRL/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Its inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate cardiac fibrosis and improve ventricular function following AMI.", "relevance_score": 1.6654, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "recovery"]}

To address this need, we developed an innovative technique utilizing immobilized H2R for the rapid identification and characterization of bioactive compounds from complex matrices. Compared with the previous screening methods, this approach can detect the binding mode of ligands on the basis of screening. In this study, the prepared H2R chromatographic column was successfully applied for kinetic interaction analysis between two specific ligands and the receptor. The bioactive compound screened and collected via the H2R column was identified as liquiritin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-IT-MS). Competitive displacement assays revealed that liquiritin competes with nizatidine and ranitidine for the same binding sites. Notably, as the concentration of famotidine in the mobile phase increased, an inverse shift in the retention time of liquiritin was observed. To elucidate this phenomenon, molecular docking simulations were performed. The results suggest that nizatidine and ranitidine compete with liquiritin for the same binding sites, reducing liquiritin-protein binding and increasing the proportion of free liquiritin, thereby causing a forward shift in the retention peak. In contrast, the acidic residues (ASP186, ASP98) of famotidine may reorganize the protein's surface charge through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, altering the electrostatic interactions of liquiritin and leading to the observed peak shift. Additionally, at higher concentrations, famotidine may form multimolecular complexes that indirectly stabilize liquiritin-protein binding. Literature review revealed that, compared to nizatidine and ranitidine, famotidine exhibits a positive regulatory effect on β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization. These findings further demonstrate that the established H2R receptor chromatography model can effectively screen bioactive components and determine their binding modes.

However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s).

The complexity of the relationship between LAT1 and cholesterol has been further studied by investigating the impact of selected oxidized forms of cholesterol, focusing on the most abundant auto-oxidized form of cholesterol, namely 7-ketocholesterol, which increases with age and pathologies characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7-ketocholesterol in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing the human LAT1 (HEK293-LAT1), decreases the Vmax of LAT1 mediated transport and the thermal stability of the protein. The impairing effect on transport was directly tested in LAT1 reconstituted proteoliposomes supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol. In this experimental model, it was found that the presence of 7-ketocholesterol altered the transport stimulation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as previously described. This was likely due to the higher rigidity of 7-ketocholesterol compared to cholesterol, which alters the membrane/protein interaction, weakening the ATP binding to LAT1. LAT1 transport function was also inhibited when proteoliposomes were supplemented with 7α-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol.

These compounds were confirmed via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Targets associated with bioactive compounds were enriched via the SWISS database, and disease-related targets were identified via GeneCards. Overlapping targets were analyzed to construct a protein - protein interaction (PPI) network, with interactions predicted via STRING and visualized via Cytoscape. Molecular docking, dynamic simulations, and transcriptomics were used to prioritize key bioactive compounds. Two ESA models were used to evaluate therapeutic effects: one induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the other by mifepristone (Ru486). Decidual histopathology was observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and hematoxylin - eosin (HE) staining. Key targets and pathways were validated through network pharmacology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), Western blotting (WB), and ELISA. Finally, the effects of SBG on pregnancy maintenance were investigated by modulating the HIF-1α pathway, with a focus on its impact on critical biomarkers identified through the screening process.\n\nRESULTS: Compared with RU486, SBG demonstrated greater efficacy in treating LPS-induced ESAs, as evidenced by lower embryo absorption rates, fewer miscarriages, and milder decidual pathological changes. Through multilevel screening, we identified 10 compounds in SBG with the highest drug potential, which were confirmed in the original plant. These compounds are predicted to specifically modulate LPS-ESA through 38 targets, influencing 525 biological processes and 126 signaling pathways. Integrated pharmacological analysis highlighted the HIF-1α signaling pathway as the key mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of SBG on ESAs. Experiments involving HIF-1α pathway activation and inhibition confirmed that SBG inhibits decidual and embryonic cell apoptosis and hypoxia by blocking HIF-1α signal transmission.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study established a rigorous framework for screening and analyzing the therapeutic components of SBG and revealed that SBG is specifically effective against ESAs and maternal-fetal interface inflammation through the HIF-1α signaling pathway.

In this study, protocatechualdehyde (PA), a plant polyphenol with diverse bioactivities, was selected. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was modified through acetalization with PA to obtain polyvinyl protocatechualdehyde acetal (PPA). Subsequently, the catechol groups of PA were enzymatically cross-linked using HRP/H₂O₂ to form a hydrogel. This acetal-grafting strategy not only shielded the functional groups of PA from excessive degradation, but also conferred acid-responsive properties to the hydrogel, thereby facilitating the sustained release of bioactive PA and its oligomers at the acidic microenvironment of the wound. Although native PA lacks photothermal activity, the HRP/H₂O₂-induced formation of dimeric and oligomeric PA structures endowed the hydrogel with intrinsic photothermal responsiveness, eliminating the need for additional photothermal agents. The PPA hydrogel exhibited excellent adhesion, hemostatic performance, photothermal conversion efficiency, antioxidant, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility.

This review outlines the principles of dose adjustment based on renal function and highlights specific issues in patients undergoing dialysis or with proteinuria. In patients undergoing dialysis, dose adjustment can be rational if drug properties such as molecular weight and protein binding are considered. Metabolites of some drugs, such as fluorouracil (5-FU), may accumulate in patients with impaired renal function, thereby increasing the risk of toxicity. For oxaliplatin, increased platinum exposure in patients undergoing dialysis does not necessarily increase toxicity, possibly because reactive platinum species are eliminated independent of renal function. Proteinuria can lead to reduced drug exposure to monoclonal antibodies owing to abnormal urinary excretion. The early detection and management of drug-induced kidney injuries are essential. These strategies include identifying risk factors, adjusting doses, and implementing monitoring systems. Protocol-based approaches, such as pharmacist-led monitoring, can improve cancer pharmacotherapy. Automated systems and AI-based models have also been explored for risk prediction.

Deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools in this domain due to their robust predictive capabilities. Integrating functional characteristics with expression data from mRNA transcripts shows promise for enhancing prediction accuracy. We developed a deep learning model called AMU (Attention mechanism Model for melanoma immUnotherapy) that incorporates a self-attention mechanism to predict clinical responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma patients based on mRNA expression profiles. We evaluated AMU's performance against established machine learning approaches including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the validation set (pre-treatment tissue samples), AMU exhibited outstanding performance, with an AUC of 0.941 and an mAP of 0.960. In the test set (post-treatment tissue samples), its AUC was 0.672, and the mAP was 0.800. Model interpretation revealed that the TNF-TNFRSF1A pathway was a crucial pathway influencing the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy. Additionally, the expression levels of CD80 and CCR3 were closely correlated with the survival rate (hazard ratios of 0.761 and 0.134, respectively) and the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma patients. The deep learning model integrated with the self-attention mechanism has demonstrated strong efficacy in processing mRNA expression data for melanoma immunotherapy response prediction. After rigorous evaluation, including batch effect correction and cross-validation, AMU achieved superior performance compared to traditional machine learning approaches. Beyond prediction accuracy, our model interpretation work identified the TNF-TNFRSF1A pathway as potentially crucial in determining melanoma ICI response, a finding aligned with recent experimental evidence. The embedding architecture's ability to capture meaningful gene-gene relationships, partially consistent with established protein interaction networks, suggests broad potential for representation learning in transcriptomic analysis. While acknowledging the limitations of current sample sizes and the need for prospective validation, this work provides both methodological advances in applying transformer architectures to gene expression data and biological insights into immunotherapy response mechanisms.

(ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human.

He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28.

We synthesized and characterized two carboxybetaine (CB)-based copolymers tailored for coating the tubing and dialyzer components of the extracorporeal circuit. Utilizing both UV irradiation immobilization and a hydrophobic self-attachment technique, we successfully coated the tubing and dialyzer surfaces, respectively, with these zwitterionic copolymers.

Delivering CBD to the lungs via a dry powder formulation could be an effective method to achieve adequate concentration and therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases. The highest FPF of 62 % was achieved with a 20 % w/w LEC concentration and a feed concentration of 0.2 % w/v. Based on this, LEC plays a crucial role in enhancing aerosolization efficiency. While feed concentration negatively affects FPF, lower feed concentrations lead to an increase in FPF. The Fine Particle Dose (FPD) varied with the concentration of CBD, with higher concentrations resulting in a higher FPD.

Validation of four topological algorithms (Degree, EPC, MCC, MNC) identified AKT1 and IL6 as key pivotal genes, as revealed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Functional enrichment highlighted important associations with the PI3K/Akt and IL-17 signaling pathways. The Microbiome-Metabolite-Target-Signaling (MMTS) network linked eight key metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids, indole derivatives) to AKT1/IL6 regulation. Drug similarity and toxicity assessments confirmed the safety of short-chain fatty acids (acetate, butyrate, propionate) and indole derivatives of the selected metabolites. Molecular docking revealed a strong binding affinity between glycerylcholic acid (AKT1: - 10.2 kcal/mol) and 3-indolepropionic acid (IL6: - 4.9 kcal/mol), suggesting that they are closely related to ASD. This study provides a new research direction on the relationship between microbial metabolites and ASD and gives better help to future researchers.", "relevance_score": 1.2016, "relevance_hits": ["protein", "safety"]}

Early detection and targeted therapy depend on identifying key molecular biomarkers that drive tumor progression. The molecular heterogeneity of COAD demands robust computational strategies to improve the accuracy of biomarker discovery.\n\nMETHODS: We developed and implemented a comprehensive, multi-step bioinformatics and statistical pipeline to systematically prioritize clinically relevant biomarkers in COAD. This pipeline integrated differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis to identify key hub genes associated with tumor progression. We subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) and overall survival modeling to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these candidates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Finally, experimental validation of the prioritized hub genes was conducted via qPCR across three CRC cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29), confirming their upregulation and supporting their clinical potential.\n\nRESULTS: Our integrative pipeline prioritized five key hub genes (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) as significantly upregulated in COAD tissues compared to normal controls. Functional enrichment analysis linked these genes to extracellular matrix degradation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory signaling, and tumor invasion, underscoring their roles in key oncogenic processes. Survival analysis revealed varying degrees of association with patient prognosis, most notably for CXCL1. Diagnostic performance, assessed by ROC analysis, yielded moderate AUC values (0.669-0.692), supporting their potential as biomarkers. Finally, qPCR validation across three CRC cell lines confirmed robust upregulation of all five genes, reinforcing their biological relevance in COAD progression.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study establishes a reproducible, integrative bioinformatics and statistical framework for the systematic identification of clinically actionable biomarkers in CRC. The five hub genes prioritized (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) demonstrated consistent diagnostic and prognostic value, offering a solid basis for the development of non-invasive molecular diagnostics and contributing to precision oncology.", "relevance_score": 1.1941, "relevance_hits": ["performance", "protein"]}

The anti-proliferation properties of lupenone were assessed via Ki67 staining, while cell apoptosis was analyzed using flow cytometry. The anti-migratory effects of lupenone were also detected using scratch wound healing assay and transwell assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways were measured using live-cell probes and real-time PCR, respectively. Autophagy and autophagy flux were evaluated through western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. In vivo experiment, the anti-tumor effects of lupenone, both as a monotherapy and in combination with cisplatin, were further examined in a CT26 tumor-bearing mouse model. Tumor volume and protein expression were used to evaluate anti-tumor efficacy, while histological staining assessed the safety of lupenone. RNA sequencing was performed to clarify the mechanisms of the combination of lupenone and cisplatin.\n\nRESULTS: Lupenone significantly inhibited the growth of CT26 and MC38 colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, reducing cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis. lupenone increased ROS levels and induced ROS-dependent ER stress in colon cancer cells. Additionally, lupenone triggered autophagy and inhibited autophagy flux, exerting anti-colon cancer effects that were attenuated by the autophagy inhibitor 3MA. Molecular docking revealed that lupenone has the potential to bind to mTOR, and the mTOR activator MHY1485 partially reversed lupenone-induced autophagy. Additionally, the scavenging of ROS and the inhibition of ER stress partially reversed the autophagic effects of lupenone. In vivo studies revealed that lupenone suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth without causing significant weight loss or damage to major organs. The combination therapy with lupenone and cisplatin enhanced anti-tumor efficacy, with RNA sequencing analyses indicating regulation of cancer cell metabolism, T cell differentiation and activation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and the immune-inflammatory microenvironment.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated lupenone monotherapy inhibited the growth of colon canceris and was non-toxic to major organs, while the combination of lupenone and chemotherapy drug could enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of chemotherapy drug.

Therefore, the isolation and screening of bifidobacteria with probiotic functions in the intestinal tract is critically important to meet the demands of the Chinese market. In the present study, 217 bifidobacterial strains were isolated and identified from 35 fecal samples collected from the city of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, China. Further investigations were conducted to determine the probiotic potential of these strains. Among the screened strains, Bifidobacterium longum ssp. longum IMAU12449 was identified as the most promising probiotic strain. The survival rate of strain IMAU12449 was highest in the simulated artificial gastrointestinal fluid. The survival rate of strain IMAU12449 in artificial gastric fluid for 3 h was 62.38%, and the survival rate was 40.30% in the artificial intestinal fluid for 8 h. Furthermore, the strain exhibited excellent cell autoaggregation (72.79%) and surface hydrophobicity (45.66%). Strain IMAU12449 also exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on common pathogens. Safety evaluation revealed that the strain possessed 2 potential antibiotic resistance genes and no virulence factors. This strain exhibited γ-hemolysis in vitro.

In this study, multi-transcriptomics analysis and various animal models of male mice were used to explore the cell-specific roles and molecular mechanisms of NEXN in vascular calcification.
