( 1 ) Created in the body from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine, this sports nutrition supplement helps your body produce more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the energetic molecule that powers short, intense muscle contractions like those used in the Olympic lifts. Our product testers evaluated dozens of creatine supplements, including many that are vegan-friendly. In our testing , we looked at: We’ve helped nearly 2 million readers find high-quality supplements, and we’re confident our guide to the best vegan creatine supplements will help you do the same. Medical disclaimer: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice. The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. It’s always a good idea to talk to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine. Individual needs for vitamins and minerals will vary. Also our choice for the best creatine supplement overall (vegan or otherwise), Transparent Labs Creatine HMB earns 4.5 out of 5 points for its formula, which includes a clinically backed dose of creatine monohydrate of 5 grams per serving. The powder also contains ß-hydroxy ß-methylbutyrate (HMB), a metabolite of the amino acid leucine, which is known to play a role in reducing muscle protein breakdown. ( 2 ) On top of that, Transparent Labs Creatine HMB contains BioPerine black pepper fruit extract. Black pepper is a source of piperine, a compound thought to increase the bioavailability of nutrients — meaning, this creatine supplement could be more readily absorbed by your body than those without piperine. Finally, the inclusion of vitamin D may further enhance muscle protein synthesis. ( 3 )( 4 ) According to registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, it’s a really strong formula backed by clinical research. The one thing that’s missing, Bourgeois notes, is caffeine for those who take creatine pre-workout. “Many people include creatine as part of their workout routine,” she says. “This formula doesn’t contain any caffeine, which might be a bummer if that’s what you’re looking for.” Our product tester, who tried the Peach Mango flavor, liked the taste well enough, though “there’s something weird about it,” she says. “The flavor itself is good and strong enough, but I think the BioPerine, which is a derivative of black pepper, is altering the taste. When you smell it, it smells spicy in a weird way. When mixed, it tastes a bit bitter unless mixed with more than the recommended amount of water.” Still, she gives it 4 out of 5 points for taste. Additionally, all three of our testers who tried this product had issues with solubility, collectively awarding it 3.5 out of 5 points. They each noted that the powder didn’t dissolve fully, resulting in “floaties” that needed to be shaken up again before each swig. Read our full Transparent Labs Creatine HMB Review . Legion Creatine Gummies are the best creatine gummies overall, and they happen to be vegan-friendly, too. These gummies are formulated with the widely researched creatine monohydrate, and they provide the upper end of the optimal dose, which earns them 4 out of 5 points for formulation. Deductions in their score stem from the use of sugar alcohols, which can cause gastrointestinal distress in some individuals. According to Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, “There’s definitely more room for research on creatine gummies, but Legion’s version is intriguing.” The clinically-backed dose, the third-party testing, and the flavor variety are all on her “pros list” for this product, she says. However, if you plan to start creatine supplementation with a loading phase , these gummies may be a no-go for you, she says, due to the fact that each serving contains 8 grams of sugar alcohols. “Research has shown that sugar alcohols like erythritol can cause digestive upset,” Bourgeois points out. “Sugar alcohols may cause nausea, bloating, and diarrhea, among other gastrointestinal effects.” Our tester didn’t have any issues with side effects, and mostly enjoyed their experience with the gummies, rating them with 4 out of 5 points for both taste and texture. They’re “more sweet than tangy and not a ton of flavor but easy enough to get down” and while “these do get stuck in your teeth a little and stick together in the jar,” it’s not a dealbreaker for our tester. Though pricey at about $1.50 per serving, Legion Creatine Gummies earn 4 out of 5 points for price because gummies in general are much more expensive than creatine powder. Legion also offers a 100% money-back guarantee if you don’t like them, no questions asked. This unflavored micronized creatine is available in two different size options and is Informed Sport certified, vegan, and gluten-free. You can even subscribe to recurring deliveries and save 15 percent. It doesn’t get simpler than this: This Sports Research supplement contains creatine monohydrate, and that’s it. No more, no less. “Each dose provides the upper end of what research deems the optimal dose of creatine monohydrate,” our tester says, “and there’s no unnecessary fluff to drive up your cost or potentially cause unwanted symptoms.” As such, this supplement earns 5 out of 5 points for its formula. “Sometimes, less is more in the supplement world,” says registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois. “You get a research-backed dose of creatine monohydrate here. Because it’s a straightforward supplement, there’s no puzzling it into your routine. It can fit easily.” If purity is a concern, you’ll be pleased to know that Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate is manufactured in a cGMP-compliant facility, Non-GMO Project Verified, NSF certified gluten-free, and NSF Informed Sport-certified. This creatine supplement also earns 5 out of 5 points for taste, or the lack thereof. It’s unflavored, and there’s no taste at all, our tester says. The same goes for solubility, which also earns 5 out of 5: “If you didn’t tell me there was creatine in this water I wouldn’t know. It’s truly tasteless and mixes easily,” our tester raves. That said, “If you’re someone who likes a little flavor in their creatine, you’re out of luck,” Bourgeois says. Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate only comes unflavored.” This no-frills creatine powder earns high marks from our expert product tester. “ProHealth hits all the high points,” they say, awarding it a perfect 5-out-of-5 score for the formula. “You get 5 grams of micronized creatine monohydrate per scoop, and each batch is third-party tested for quality, purity, and potency.” Registered dietitian Chelsea Rae Bourgeois likes the simplicity of ProHealth Longevity Creatine. “You don’t have to sacrifice research-backed dosing of creatine for other ingredients,” she says. “It’s also free of 10 major allergens: dairy, egg, soy, wheat, gluten, corn, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts. Not all creatine products are made in allergen-free facilities.” Bourgeois points out that ProHealth uses Creavitalis , which is marketed as a high-quality and easily absorbed creatine monohydrate, as opposed to the current standard used in most products, CreaPure . “We know creatine has a lot to offer, but I’d love to see more research on Creavitalis, specifically.” Bourgeois says. ProHealth Longevity Creatine earns 4 out of 5 points from our tester for taste. “I noticed a slight aftertaste in water, and my wife thought it tasted metallic, but we didn’t notice this when mixed in a sports drink” he says. Our tester gives it 5 out of 5 points for solubility, noting that it’s much more powdery than other creatines he’s tried so it mixes great, but it does settle at the bottom of the glass or bottle eventually. This product is more expensive than average for a plain creatine monohydrate powder at $0.55 per serving, so it earns 3.5 out of 5 points for price. However, the increased cost may be worth it to those who need a product certified to be free from the 10 major allergens. This extremely inexpensive creatine is micronized for extra solubility. We also appreciate Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate for its available flavor profiles, although the use of sucralose as a sweetening agent may lead to GI distress in some athletes. Fitness enthusiasts on a budget will love that Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate powder costs just 20 cents per serving. A tub of 100 servings will run you a little over $20, or less if you choose to subscribe and save. It earns a perfect score of 5 out of 5 points for price. It has a winning formula, too, earning 4.5 out of 5 points. While it contains the upper end of the clinically backed dose of creatine—5 grams per serving—a half-point deduction comes from the inclusion of sucralose in flavored options. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener known to cause digestive upset in some individuals, which is something to be aware of if you have a sensitive stomach. “Nutricost stays true to its name with this one,” says Chelsea Rae Bourgeois, RD, LDN. “Each serving provides a clinically-backed dose of creatine monohydrate at a budget-friendly price. I love that Nutricost doesn’t limit their dosing to keep your cost per serving low.” In addition to its low price, it tastes good, too. Rather, it tastes like nothing, our tester says, which is ideal for an unflavored creatine product. “It’s actually tasteless, even in water,” they say, awarding it 5 out of 5 points. Nutricost creatine doesn’t score quite as high for solubility, earning a score of 3 out of 5 points. It settles in the bottom of the glass if you don’t drink it in one go, our tester notes. Read our full Nutricost Creatine Review . Our team of product testers, which includes certified personal trainers, certified nutrition coaches, and other health and fitness professionals, spent weeks identifying and testing—yes, actually ingesting—dozens of creatine supplements. We evaluated eight criteria for each product we tried, rating each on a scale from 1 to 5: A score of 1-2 is below average; a score of 3 is average for the industry; a score of 4-5 is above average. These products are also great choices for anyone, including those on a vegan diet. Making a case for creatine isn’t hard: There’s a very long list of creatine benefits . Vegan creatine supplements range in price from about 20 cents per serving to nearly $2 per serving. Expect to pay about $20 to $50 per month, depending on the brand. As you shop for creatine , keep these factors in mind. Creatine monohydrate remains the gold standard. For enhanced bioavailability, look for micronized creatine powder. Other forms of protein, like creatine hydrochloride (HCl) and creatine ethyl ester, have not been proven more effective or beneficial. ( 16 ) Look out for fillers. Except for flavors—and in some cases, depending on the type of supplement (i.e., gummies), preservatives—creatine supplements don’t need many ingredients at all. In fact, some of the best creatine supplements contain just one ingredient: creatine. One common con of creatine is bloating, and minimizing artificial sweeteners and additives can help keep digestion smooth. If you plan to use your creatine pre-workout, consider a formula with caffeine to boost energy levels and further enhance exercise performance. If you want to be sure about the quality and purity of your creatine, look for independent analyses of the contents. The best indicator of quality is a certification from the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), but certificates of composition from any lab can tell you if the product contains any contaminants and if it is properly dosed. The cleanest vegan creatine supplements are those that contain only pure creatine monohydrate powder. Examples include Sports Research Creatine Monohydrate and Nutricost Creatine Monohydrate, both of which have a single ingredient: micronized creatine monohydrate. Yes. Vegan creatine is synthesized in a lab, and most creatine supplements on the market are made that way. Look out for gelatin in capsules and gummies if use of animal products is not negotiable for you. Unfortunately, it’s tough for vegans to get enough creatine from diet alone, since the most potent natural sources include red meat, poultry. and fish. Vegetarians can get small amounts through eggs and dairy products. Luckily, most lab-created creatine products are, in fact, plant-based creatine. Since they are synthesized chemically from the amino acids sarcosine and cyanamide, they do not contain animal byproducts. Exceptions include gelatin in capsules and gummies. Yes, of course. People on a vegan diet can build muscle by following a hypertrophic strength training plan, eating in a calorie surplus, and prioritizing protein and amino acid intake. Creatine is not directly involved in muscle-building processes like muscle protein synthesis. ( 17 ) However, it can improve athletic performance and muscle recovery, leading to increases in muscle strength and power.

Björnsson’s day starts with one and a half liters of water mixed with Hydrate, an electrolyte powder , and creatine . His daily nutrition plan consists of five meals, which are organized when he wakes up and coordinated with his workout schedule. Björnsson consumes approximately 400 grams of protein en route to 8,000 daily calories . “I used to eat 10,000 calories daily . When I was younger, I was more active and needed more calories,” Björnsson recalled. “Now, I am old, lazy, and eat only 8,000.” Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Meal one contains approximately 1,640 calories, earning Israetel’s approval as a quintessential bodybuilding meal. When Björnsson feels sluggish during training, removing olive oil or another easily-controllable, high-calorie condiment from his diet can help alleviate the issue. Björnsson’s second meal packs approximately 1,390 calories. High-calorie liquid additions to meals make strongman dieting easier,” Dr. Israetel said. Meal three provides approximately 1,350 calories. For meals four and five, Björnsson repeats meals two and three. His current meal plan has resulted in noticeable gains in strength and size, fueling him to attempt another deadlift world record at the 2025 World Deadlift Championships on Sept. 6, 2025, in Las Vegas, NV.

But is it all hype? The most recent research suggests collagen may not live up to the claims that permeate the fitness world . Dr. Layne Norton , Ph.D. in Nutritional Sciences, doubts collagen’s value. Collagen supplementation looks like a scam. I am skeptical. Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body, helping make up the skin, bones, tendons, ligaments , and cartilage. There are at least 16 types, but types I, II, and III are closely tied to fitness and joint /skin health. There are four main ways collagen works in the body: Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice . The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. To separate fact from marketing, a 2023 randomized controlled trial from Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise examined how collagen supplementation affects muscle connective tissue protein synthesis after exercise. The findings showed that collagen ingestion during recovery did not increase connective tissue protein synthesis , suggesting that it may not enhance muscle and tendon repair the way some supplements claim. ( 1 ) A post shared by Jeremy L. Buendia (@jeremy_buendia) If muscle and connective tissue don’t benefit, what about skin? New evidence indicates collagen might not help skin hydration, elasticity, or wrinkles. A 2025 meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials, including 1,474 participants, found improvements only in pharma-funded studies. In contrast, research not funded by pharmaceutical companies reported no significant benefits. ( 2 ) Excluding outlier studies, collagen supplements showed no significant improvements in wrinkles, hydration, or elasticity. Swapping collagen for whey protein might be the right move for strength, vitality, and muscle building . Whey protein consistently outperforms collagen in head-to-head comparisons for hypertrophy . ( 3 ) Research has shown no significant differences between whey and collagen for stimulating connective tissue synthesis, making collagen the inferior option for those seeking muscle growth or recovery benefits. ( 4 ) ( 5 ) “Collagen literally has the worst amino acid profile of any protein source on the market,” Dr. Norton asserted. “It is absurdly low in essential amino acids, specifically the branch chain amino acids and leucine, which stimulate muscle protein synthesis.” Everyone wants an edge in training, but high-quality research shows collagen’s effects on muscle and connective tissue are inconsistent. Its real-world impact on muscle growth, recovery, and skin health appears limited, leaving its effectiveness debatable.

( 1 ) The new data shows most benefits between 300 and 900 milligrams daily, typically taken for 8-12 weeks, with 600 milligrams being the most commonly effective dose . Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. Editor’s note: The content on BarBend is meant to be informative in nature, but it should not be taken as medical advice . The opinions and articles on this site are not intended for use as diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of health problems. Talking to your doctor before beginning a new fitness, nutritional, and/or supplement routine is always a good idea. The review was narrative rather than systematic, so no formal risk-of-bias scoring was applied. Eighty percent of studies were conducted on young men, with the first female randomized controlled trial only appearing in 2025, limiting data for females. Sample sizes were typically under 60 participants, and most studies lasted only 8-12 weeks, leaving long-term effects unclear. The muscle-building effects of ashwagandha are evident. “There is a discernible increase in lean mass that’s measured and verifiable,” Dr. Israetel explained, “It comes out to roughly a few pounds of muscle over that typical time course.” Approximately 25-40% of creatine’s muscle-building capacity; modest but meaningful. The results for strength were slightly better: the effects of “40 to 60% of the effect of creatine” for one-rep max improvements, typically showing 5-8% increases over 8-12 week programs. Ashwagandha appears to function through hormonal modulation. “Testosterone makes you jacked, cortisol makes you less jacked,” Dr. Israetel declared. “Testosterone makes you leaner, cortisol makes you less lean.” ( 2 )( 3 ) “If you reduce cortisol substantially with [ashwagandha] and boost testosterone, that’s where many of these other benefits really come from,” Dr. Israetel clarified. Ashwagandha appears to boost VO₂ max significantly, with studies showing approximately 4ml/kg/min improvements over 8-12 weeks. ( 4 ) This enhancement in aerobic capacity could improve recovery between sets and training sessions. Recovery markers showed improvement, demonstrating 10-20% better recovery scale scores and reduced soreness perception. A post shared by Blast Vitality (@blastvitality) Ashwagandha has robust effects on stress management, with multiple studies demonstrating anxiety reduction. ( 5 )( 6 )( 7 )( 8 ) This has psychological and physiological benefits, such as improved training outcomes through better sleep quality and lower chronic cortisol exposure. ( 9 ) While generally safe for most healthy adults, ashwagandha isn’t always completely side-effect-free, with many reports of undesirable mental and physical reactions. Reducing stress and anxiety, though good, could interfere with natural emotions if excessive. The review positions ashwagandha as a “moderate multi-mechanism adjunct” rather than a tier-one supplement like creatine. Ashwagandha provides roughly half of creatine’s physiological effects plus more benefits. Stressful periods like the latter stages of fat loss, when cortisol levels are elevated, may be optimal for ashwagandha dosing. Taking 300-600mg daily of high-quality extract in the morning may offer a low-risk option for modest but noticeable improvements. Always speak to your physician before taking new supplements.

Analyzed by the House of Hypertrophy (HoH), the research reveals evidence that challenges conventional advice. One to five reps is considered the strength zone , where hypertrophy is observed. Due to mechanical tension, volume , fatigue management, and joint health, the six to 12 rep range is often considered the sweet spot for muscle growth . Could a few sets of three to five reps produce similar or better growth stimulus? Fourteen trained individuals with at least two years of lifting experience performed unilateral leg presses and extensions . (1) Subjects trained one leg for three to five reps to volitional failure using heavy loads, while the other leg performed 20-25 repetitions to failure with lighter weights. Workouts comprised three sets per session with two-minute rest periods between sets, training twice weekly for nine weeks. Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. “Muscle thickness increases were not significantly different between conditions,” HoH noted. As other research determined, vastly different rep ranges can produce similar hypertrophy outcomes. ( 2 )( 3 ) However, while whole muscle thickness increased for both rep ranges tested, neither showed increased muscle fiber cross-sectional area from biopsies, likely due to sampling limitations. “Biopsies obviously only extract a relatively small portion of muscle,” HoH reported. “In the paper, just over 150 fibers were contained per biopsy, but muscles, even small ones, usually comprise thousands of fibers.” Did all subjects train to failure equally, and does it matter? This wasn’t entirely clear, though verbal cues encouraged effort. Literature indicates that trained lifters might benefit from pushing sets to complete failure, but training habits and individual effort could skew outcomes. ( 4 ) Determining a minimum rep number to stimulate hypertrophy is complicated, as many studies report rep ranges. Individual variation, including genetics , training habits, nutrition , health, and workout fatigue, determines how people can perform different rep counts at the same percentage of their one-rep max . ( 5 ) HoH previously advocated for a six-to-35-rep range for hypertrophy. Only six studies examined five or fewer repetitions, with many having confounding variables, such as additional sets or longer rest periods. Adding additional sets of three to five reps and resting longer enhances growth stimulus. Only two studies support three to five reps with these variables; the total evidence base is relatively small. Small-sample studies can fail to represent reality due to measurement error, sampling variance, or genetic differences between groups. This study, while promising, is limited, with only 14 subjects. If your goal is to maximize muscle hypertrophy…train with six or more reps per set. Those benefitting from three to five reps should stick to it and mix rep ranges for joint health and varied stimuli. While the new study suggests three to five reps may maximize hypertrophy when performed to failure, evidence isn’t yet strong enough to confirm that it’s equally hypertrophic. Six reps and above remain a safer minimum to maximize muscle gains, but some lower-rep work is still good for strength and motor unit recruitment.

Intense training sessions drain the body’s carbohydrate reserves, which muscles depend on for performance. If those stores stay low, it can slow recovery and reduce the ability to grow muscle. ( 1 ) Pairing carbs with quality protein restores glycogen and spares muscle tissue from further breakdown. Carbs are massively anti-catabolic. They prevent muscle loss to a huge extent. Dr. Israetel believes that consuming a post-workout sooner rather than later helps to halt muscle breakdown, setting the stage for better recovery. ( 5 ) A post shared by Casey Kelly (@caseykellyfit) “Relatively low-fat, high-carb, high-quality protein within 30 minutes of your workout…no more check marks left,” Dr. Israetel explained. Even strength athletes and strongmen in a calorie surplus follow the same strategy: Aim for clean, nutrient-dense foods, then fill the gaps with higher-calorie options to meet energy demands. You have a total calorie budget to hit. Establish a core of healthy foods that give you the most benefits. Balancing high protein and carbs with low fat is Dr. Israetel’s recipe for rapid recovery and muscle growth.

You don’t need a bench to build bigger, stronger pecs , though. Proper exercise swaps can get the job done. In late August 2025, bodybuilder Simeon Panda shared his favorite alternatives to presses and flyes for the upper, mid, and lower pecs. Looking to connect with fellow fitness lovers like you? Head over to the BarBend Community Forum to ask questions, share advice, and talk all things training. The flat bench press is a proven mid-pec builder that secondarily recruits the triceps and front delts. However, evidence indicates that dumbbell and machine presses offer comparable chest activation. A 2023 study in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research found no significant differences in hypertrophy between dumbbell, barbell, and Smith machine presses . ( 1 ) Cable presses also elicit strong chest activation through EMG testing. ( 2 ) The incline bench press targets upper pec fibers, but some might find it causes discomfort for the front delts and rotator cuffs. A trio of incline options can get around these issues. Incline dumbbell presses fire the upper pecs and engage stabilizers more than barbells, helping build strength . ( 3 ) Smith incline presses offer a safer, guided bar path, but they may not engage muscles as much as free weights; participants in one study lifted roughly 3% more with a barbell bench press. ( 4 ) A post shared by Simeon Panda (@simeonpanda) Other options include the cable or machine presses. Measurements from a 2020 study found that a seated chest press with a neutral grip triggered greater activation of the upper chest compared to an overhand grip bench press. ( 5 ) As a pec deck substitute, dumbbell and cable flye variations isolate the pectoralis major. Data from the Journal of Sports Science & Medicine examined muscle activation from flyes. They found that standing variations provided a similar stimulus to the pec deck due to constant tension. ( 6 ) A post shared by Simeon Panda (@simeonpanda) Lower pec development is key for the “shelf” aesthetic . Panda’s answer is dumbbell pullovers . It’s a potent alternative, but the degree of pec activation varies based on shoulder angle. ( 7 ) Decline presses on a Smith machine or with dumbbells target the lower pecs. Dumbbells are slightly superior for muscle engagement, making them a strong choice as a workout finisher.

    "combined_text": "Biological age tests: Should you get one?\n\n<p>Plus, five FREE ways to test how quickly you’re aging—from home.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/biological-age-testing\">Biological age tests: Should you get one?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare Johnson, the subject of the Netflix documentary Don’t Die , says he’s on a quest to achieve the lowest possible “biological age” (also known as bio age). He reportedly spends millions each year on anti-aging treatments—dozens of daily supplements, weekly acid peels for his skin, injections to boost collagen production, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and plasma infusions extracted from his 17-year-old son’s body. To determine what’s working, Johnson has undergone numerous tests to assess his bio age. Johnson says these tests show his age is now 5.1 years younger than when he embarked on his anti-aging quest. Apparently, he’s aging in reverse. Granted, not everyone’s buying it. A New York Times exposé, for example, claims Johnson’s biological age, in reality, has increased by 10 years. 1 Still, Johnson’s “don’t die” crusade is gaining traction. Bio age tests are a frequent topic on popular podcasts by Peter Attia, Joe Rogan, and Andrew Huberman. Google “bio age testing” and you’ll see dozens of ads for mail-order blood or urine testing kits that claim to reveal your biological age, pace of aging, and more. With prices tumbling into affordability, it’s natural to wonder… Should you or your client sign up for bio age testing? If so, which test is best? Just as importantly, what should you do with the information? In this story, you’ll learn: Your biological age (bio age) refers to how your cells function. It’s not necessarily the same as your chronological age, which refers to the number of candles on your birthday cake. For example, let’s say Chang, a 50-year-old man, works at a desk, spends his free time in front of the TV, lives in the most polluted city in the world, eats a candy bar for lunch, and smokes. On the other hand, Jabari, a different 50-year-old man, hits the gym several times a week, lives in the mountains, doesn’t smoke, relishes his five servings of veggies a day, meditates, and spends most evenings in his garden. Genetics aside, you’d be wise to wager that Jabari’s bio age is younger than Chang’s. Bio age testing kits measure one or more biological markers of aging, also known as biomarkers . For example, some tests focus on the size of your telomeres , the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. Others measure DNA methylation , a physiological process that chemically alters DNA. Once a company isolates and measures these markers from your blood or urine, it plugs the bio data into a formula that calculates your bio age. However, if you see a doctor with any regularity, you’re likely already tracking some biomarkers of aging. For example, biomarkers such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood glucose can help predict your risk of future cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of premature death. Biomarker testing can help you monitor your wellness proactively rather than waiting for disease symptoms to appear. For some, it also serves as a motivator. If you learn you have the bones of someone 20 years older, this may give you the nudge you need to start strength training consistently. In addition, biomarkers provide objective data, allowing you to track and evaluate various health-related actions quantitatively. By monitoring your blood pressure, you might learn that consistent exercise helps, but your late-afternoon energy drink does the opposite. You don’t have to be a billionaire (or even a millionaire) to track biomarkers of aging. In this section, we’ll cover several massively underappreciated, scientifically validated tests you can use to gain insight into your bio age—for FREE. Before scientists developed high-tech blood-based bio age tests, researchers used these free tests to calculate the pace of aging in the people they studied. People who are fitter and stronger tend to live longer. 2 That’s because muscles do more than just move us around. They also secrete anti-inflammatory substances, help to regulate blood sugar, slow cellular aging, protect the lining of the arteries, and more. All this helps reduce the risk of age-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease, a phenomenon we explore in our article, The New Science of Muscle. Related to strength, your ability to balance is also key. If you’re middle-aged or older and can’t stand on one foot for at least 10 seconds, your risk of dying in the next seven years is double that of someone who can stand for longer, according to a study of 1,700 people. 3 The Sitting-Rising Test (SRT) is one way to assess both strength and balance at the same time. People with low scores on this test have a higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, according to a 12-year study of 4,200 adults between the ages of 46 and 75. 4 ▶ How to measure it Lower yourself to the floor with your legs in a crisscross position. Then, with your legs in the same position, stand back up. As you stand, notice if you must use a part of your body—hand, shin, knee—as leverage. To score yourself, start with 10 points. Then, for each body part you used to stand, deduct a point. Subtract a half point if you became unsteady or lost your balance. Keep in mind that this (and other tests) serve as a proxy for your fitness. A low score indicates that your balance and coordination, muscle strength and power, and mobility may all require some attention. Like the SRT test, your grip strength provides insight into your overall fitness. If the muscles in your hands are weak, the muscles throughout your body are more likely to be weak, too. Poor grip strength can also predict future muscle weakness. In one study, people with a weak grip were more likely to walk slowly and be unable to rise from a chair, complete rigorous housework, or climb a flight of steps 25 years later. 5 Low grip strength has also been associated with: 6 According to one study, grip strength was a better indicator of longevity (or lack thereof) than blood pressure. 7 ▶ How to measure it Grab a standard tennis ball, and squeeze as hard as you can, for as long as you can. If you can manage 15 to 30 seconds before your grip fatigues, you’re doing fine. Ninety seconds puts you well above average—anything over 90 ranks you solidly in the upper-third percentile. If you’re below 15, keep in mind that this test is also just one indicator of your overall strength. (And squeezing balls to improve grip strength without training the rest of your body is unlikely to make significant improvements in your overall health and fitness.) A hand-held dynamometer—available for use at most occupational therapists’ and some gyms—can also test grip strength. (If you’re willing to shell out some cash, you can buy your own for somewhere between $100 and $500.) An ability to balance on one foot for an extended period can help reduce your risk of falls, one of the leading causes of injury-related death among older adults. In addition, many different bodily systems—the eyes, inner ear, skeletal muscles, and brain—must work together to help you stay upright. Conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer can all affect balance. As a result, an inability to stand on one foot can serve as a warning sign for eroding health and fitness. 8 ▶ How to measure it Stand near a wall or chair for safety. Keep your eyes open and hands on your hips. Then, lift your dominant leg and start timing yourself. Once you put your foot down, stop the clock. Repeat the test with your non-dominant leg. Once you have your times, compare them to the following averages, from a study out of Duke University, to see how you did compared to your age-matched peers. 9 Sometimes you know why you’re tired, such as the morning after binge-watching the last few episodes of a thriller. Once you catch up on your sleep, the weariness lifts. That’s not the same thing as fatigue , which describes persistent exhaustion that worsens over time and interferes with life. In addition to feeling physically tired, someone who’s fatigued feels mentally dull and emotionally exhausted. Think of fatigue as an early sign that something’s off, especially if you don’t know the cause. Let’s say you’ve already ruled out the usual suspects like too much caffeine, dehydration, too much alcohol, medication side effects, chronic stress, or too much or too little exercise. What’s left is likely a sleep disorder or a developing health problem such as anemia, obesity, depression, cancer, or diabetes, to name a few. If you’re 60 or older, fatiguability —or how worn out you feel after an activity—can also predict longevity. According to research out of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, the higher someone scores in fatiguability, the higher their risk of death in the future. 10 Other research has linked high fatiguability with declines in gait speed, walking ability, and other tests of fitness. 11 ▶ How to measure it To measure fatigability, use a tool called the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale. Using a 0 (no fatigue) to 5 (extreme fatigue) scale, rate how fatigued you think you would feel after completing the following activities: If you score less than 15, you’re doing well. Scores between 15 and 24 are a warning sign. Anything 25 and above is regarded as severe, and worth mentioning to your healthcare professional. 12 Despite popular belief, both too little and too much body fat can influence health for the worse, as we explore in our infographic, Is body fat good or bad for you? Your muscle mass also plays a role, which is why someone’s body composition matters more than their weight . The gold standard methods that estimate body composition—underwater weighing, air displacement (Bod Pod), and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)—certainly aren’t free. However, a recent study determined that a good old-fashioned (and cheap) tape measure can provide a comparably accurate estimate of body composition. 13 ▶ How to measure it To use a tape measure to keep track of your body fat percentage, measure: Ensure the tape is snug but not so tight that it cuts into the skin. Once you have your measurements, plug those numbers—along with your age, sex, height, and weight—into our FREE Body Fat Calculator , which will take it from there. Depending on where you live in the world, the following tests may not be free. However, as part of routine preventative care, your insurance might cover them. If your primary care doctor recommends yearly blood work, it’s for good reason. By keeping tabs on several blood markers, you can see if your health is trending toward type 2 diabetes or heart disease, both leading causes of premature mortality. Many blood markers can also be influenced relatively quickly (within 6 to 12 weeks) through lifestyle changes, supplement protocols, or medications. This makes them practical tools for monitoring whether various lifestyle or medical modifications are working. ▶ How to measure it If you’re not already doing so, consider having the following blood markers tested annually. Then, talk to your health care professional about what your numbers mean. They might use the following numbers, along with your blood pressure, to calculate a cardiovascular disease risk score. *Milligrams per deciliter of blood **Milligrams per liter When researchers study healthy super-agers aged 90 and older, strong bones are one of their defining features. 14 That may be because, like muscles, bones are live organs that secrete substances that may be beneficial to overall health and longevity. 15 For example, bones secrete osteocalcin , a hormone that plays a role in bone remodeling. When osteocalcin circulates in the body, it’s thought to play a role in everything from helping muscles to produce ATP to regulating brain neurotransmitters. Because of these varied roles, it’s thought that, as bones wear away, osteocalcin levels drop, contributing to many age-related health problems, including diabetes, low muscle mass, and cognitive issues. 16 17 (At least, that’s the theory. Most of this research has been done on mice.) Osteocalcin aside, loss of bone density can, of course, lead to fractures, which can increase your risk of death for up to 10 years after a break. 18 It’s especially important to keep tabs on bone health if you’re in any of these high-risk categories: ▶ How to measure it Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans are a type of X-ray that measures the amount of bone mineral content packed into a square centimeter of bone. Insurance often won’t cover these scans for people younger than 65 unless there’s a documented risk of developing osteoporosis. Out of pocket, the average cost is about $300. When you receive your DEXA results, you’ll see a T-score that represents how your bone density compares to the average bone density of a young adult with peak bone mass. A T-score of +1.0 to -1.0 means you have normal bone mineral density for someone your age. Anything below -1.0 means you might have osteopenia (low bone mineral density) or osteoporosis (porous bones that are prone to fracture). If you have some money to burn, you can learn an awful lot about your body. Here, you’ll find a quick run-down on some of the more high-tech tests you can get and what they can tell you. However, before we get into the details, we want to point out a few caveats: ▶ Biological age can vary over time, and by organ. Someone may go through a period of accelerated aging—saying, during a period of intense stress—then their rate of aging may slow as they focus more on recovery. Additionally, organs can age at different rates. For example, someone with heart disease may have a relatively older heart than their kidneys. (Not all tests measure individual organ age, but it’s becoming more common.) ▶ Commercial tests won’t always accurately reflect the changes you’re making. Until more research supports the reliability of these tests, evaluate your behaviors over isolated test results. If you’re eating more fruits and veggies, exercising more consistently, managing stress, and otherwise slaying the healthy lifestyle department, don’t sweat your results. Focus on doing the things we know improve health. ▶ If a company pairs your test results with a hard sell for a proprietary and expensive supplement protocol, be wary. It’s better to share and discuss your results with a trusted health professional than take health advice from a profit-seeking stranger over the internet. DNA methylation is a biological process that chemically alters DNA. Because the rate of methylation accelerates with aging, it can be used to estimate someone’s biological age and life expectancy, finds research. 19 20 21 The Horvath Clock and DunedinPACE both measure specific biomarkers that can be used to better understand someone’s methylation rate. Scientists developed these tests to help other scientists study how various lifestyle factors, environmental exposures, and medicines affect aging. They didn’t develop the tests as a way for the average person to pinpoint their biological age. (Which hasn’t stopped companies from selling DNA methylation testing kits to the public.) They cost about $300. If you decide to get one of these tests, keep in mind your results won’t give you a complete picture of your health and longevity. Aging typically occurs at varying rates throughout the body. Your liver might age faster than your heart or brain, for example. So if you measure DNA methylation in your blood, that’s all you know about. Put another way, a DNA methylation test isn’t a substitute for your annual wellness checkup or blood work. Telomeres—the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes—wear away with age. The length of a telomere can predict how many times a specific cell can divide before dying. Abnormally short telomeres are associated with several genetic diseases. For this reason, when physicians suspect someone might have inherited a genetic disease, they’ll order a specific type of telomere test—the flow-FISH test —to measure the telomere length in all the cells in a blood sample. 22 23 It’s more debatable whether telomere tests can predict aging in healthy people. Just as importantly, the telomere test marketed to the public, known as the qPCR telomere test , isn’t used in research or medicine. These $100 tests are fine if you’re merely curious—just don’t base health and fitness decisions on your results. For years, only elite athletes cared about VO2 max, which describes the maximum amount of oxygen that your body can use during exercise. More recently, however, some experts have suggested that VO2 max can serve as a measure for athletes and non-athletes alike to track the rate at which their bodies are aging. People with high VO2 max tend not only to be more physically fit but also less likely to develop heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke. 24 25 26 27 In an observational study that followed the health outcomes of 5,107 Danish men over 46 years, men with above-average V02 max during middle age lived an average of five years longer than men with below-average V02 max. Each unit increase in VO2 max was associated with a 45-day increase in longevity. The researchers suggested VO2 max may more accurately predict all-cause mortality than high cholesterol, obesity, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance. 28 You might think of V02 max as a canary and your aging body as a coal mine. As you age, your chest wall becomes more rigid, the muscles that surround the lungs weaker, and the oxygen-carrying blood vessels calcified and less elastic. The heart also squeezes with less force, max heart rate drops, muscle mass and strength decline, the mitochondria in cells and muscles lose their effectiveness, among other differences. In addition to raising your risk for many different diseases, these changes can also affect VO2 max, which tends to decline 10 percent per decade starting around age 30. 29 30 In the past, the only way to reliably measure VO2 max was in a fitness lab. You would wear a metabolic mask and a heart monitor while you ran or cycled to exhaustion. The mask collected your expired carbon dioxide and monitored how much oxygen you sucked into your lungs. This lab-based testing is still the most accurate way to measure V02 max as well as other key fitness metrics such as: Depending on where you live, you might be able to get your VO2 max tested for around $150. However, if you don’t have access to a VO2 max clinic, three somewhat less accurate options exist. ▶ The 1-mile walk test Wear a heart rate monitor as you walk one mile on a flat surface, such as a treadmill or running track. As soon as you complete the mile, record your heart rate and walk time. Then, plug it into the following formula to calculate your VO2 max: 132.853 — (0.0769 × Weight) — (0.3877 × Age) + (6.315 × Sex) — (3.2649 × Time) — (0.1565 × Heart rate) If that feels like too much math, you can also use a free online tool . ▶ The smartwatch test Many smartwatches will estimate your VO2 Max for you based on information the watch gathers from your workouts, sex, and age. Compared to in-office testing, smart watches can over- or underestimate V02 max, especially in people who are very out of shape or extremely fit. 31 Because of this, you don’t necessarily want to use your smart watch measurement to determine your current state of health. However, it can help you to see trends. For example, does your VO2 estimate drop after a few weeks of skipping your usual spin class? If so, that’s good information to have. ▶ The PR test Fitness performance correlates with longevity. If you’re getting faster at running a certain distance or can go a longer distance than before, you’re getting fitter and increasing your chances of living a long, healthy life. One way to test this: the 12-minute run test, also known as the Cooper test. (This is a validated way to estimate VO2 max—and shows about a 90 percent correlation with lab-based measurements.) Here’s how it works: Run as fast as you can on a flat surface, such as a treadmill set at a 1 percent incline or running track, for 12 minutes. After 12 minutes, record your distance. Then, plug it into one of the following formulas to calculate your VO2 max. In lieu of doing math, you can also use a free online calculator . Try to think of the information you gather about your body as just that—information. It’s not a moral judgment of who you are as a person. Just as importantly, it’s not a permanent situation. You have options. However, most people make two big mistakes when it comes to longevity-related lifestyle changes. It’s the simple, boring, “I’ve heard this a million times before” health practices that, when done consistently, add up to a long, healthy life. We’re talking about things like… And that’s just a partial list. According to thousands of studies, people who practice these and other high-impact strategies not only live longer, but also live better. They’re stronger, happier, and less likely to spend their later years disabled or in pain. (If you’d like to see where you stand when it comes to big impact health and longevity strategies, check out our FREE Longevity Assessment .) However, when it comes to health, fitness, and longevity, many people pursue options with minimal impact (at best). They reach for the latest, trendy supplement rather than taking steps to quit smoking, as just one example. Here’s the thing: Big rock strategies require changes in behavior. If daily physical activity were as easy as popping a pill, walkers and cyclists would clog up the streets in your neighborhood. (It’s precisely this reason why so many people need the support of a certified health coach who has undergone training in the science of behavior change.) The data gathered from biomarker aging tests can give you a sense of control. However… Data, in isolation, doesn’t lead to a longer life. Gathering data without changing your behavior is like checking your reflection in the mirror, seeing spinach wedged between your incisors, and leaving it there. You need to remove the spinach for the mirror check to be worthwhile. Biomarker testing is the same. If you don’t use your bio data to inform behavior change, you’re wasting your money and time. Consider your biomarker data as a baseline or starting point. Then, use it to assess whether various lifestyle changes or medical interventions are moving you closer to your goal of living a longer, healthier life.

Some people with IBS experience bouts of abdominal pain they describe as worse than childbirth. These flare-ups can siphon concentration, interrupt sleep, and destroy work productivity. 3 As a result, many people with IBS plan their lives around the availability of private, clean bathrooms. Fear of a sudden flare-up leads some to avoid restaurants, get-togethers, even exercising in public. This pervading worry has a name— gastrointestinal-specific anxiety —and it can affect everything from social relationships to overall well-being. It’s also the main reason people with IBS report worse quality of life than people with other chronic conditions, including heart disease, diabetes, and end-stage kidney disease. 4 PN Super Coach Sarah Maughan, certified through Monash University—a global leader in understanding the link between food sensitivities and IBS—has witnessed how lifestyle changes can prevent flare-ups, calm GI anxiety, and allow people with IBS to live the lives they want. “My hope is for everyone with IBS to know they have options, whether that’s turning to a physician for medication and/or a health coach to learn about lifestyle changes and how to put them into action,” says Maughan. In this article, we’ll hear more from Maughan. You’ll also learn: Plus, if you’re a health coach, you’ll learn how to support clients with IBS while safely staying within your scope of practice. Sometimes referred to as “spastic colon,” IBS is the most commonly diagnosed digestive disorder in the world, affecting about 14 percent percent of adults. 5 Unlike Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), IBS doesn’t alter the architecture of the gut. When healthcare professionals use diagnostic imaging, they find no infections, inflammation, damage to the bowel wall, or other evidence of disease. Years ago, this lack of visible disease led many healthcare professionals to assume that IBS was purely psychological. More recently, however, this thinking has shifted. Experts now view IBS as a functional neuro-gastrointestinal disorder. That means the nerves between the GI tract and the brain don’t function optimally, causing the brain to deliver unnecessary pain signals and interfere with typical bowel function. IBS symptoms can come and go, with some people experiencing months or years of relief only to suffer a severe flare-up that can last hours to weeks. In addition, not everyone with IBS experiences the same set of symptoms, which can make the condition challenging to diagnose. The below illustration shows the range of IBS symptoms.  Researchers are still trying to understand why the gut functions differently in people with IBS. However, they do have a few theories. According to one hypothesis, the nerve endings in the GI tract may be overly sensitive in people with IBS. This can lead to two different sets of symptoms. ▶ Hypersensitive nerves communicate pain signals to the brain, causing people with IBS to notice digestive processes that other people wouldn’t feel. Tiny gas bubbles may be severely uncomfortable for someone with IBS, for example, but not bother someone without the disorder. ▶ Overreactive nerves can trigger GI muscles to contract with too much force, leading to gas, bloating, and diarrhea. If they underreact, the same muscles don’t contract forcefully enough, which slows the passage of food through the intestine and leads to constipation. Another theory blames disturbances on the gut microbiome , which helps to explain why some people develop IBS symptoms after first having a severe GI illness like the Norovirus. If you or your client suspect IBS, see a credentialed health professional. The symptoms of IBS overlap with several other gastrointestinal diseases and health conditions that can require medication, surgery, or medically-supervised lifestyle changes. These include infections, inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, cancer, and food allergies, among others. It’s especially important to see a medical professional if you or your client notice any of the following: In addition to ruling out other GI conditions, a healthcare professional will also ask detailed questions about you or your client’s symptoms. This information allows them to pinpoint which IBS “type” you or your client might have: You or your client’s IBS type will inform what your healthcare professional recommends. A healthcare provider might suggest a short course of antibiotics and antidiarrheal medicine for IBS-D. On the other hand, for IBS-C, they might recommend a fiber supplement, non-habit-forming laxative, laxative-like medication, or other medicine that reduces the perception of pain and regulates bowel movements. In order to get the most out of the visit, you can help your client (or yourself) prepare for a healthcare appointment. A healthcare professional will likely ask the following questions, so consider the responses beforehand: Another way to prepare for your first appointment? Well, you might not like it, but it’s a good idea to… Consider keeping a poo diary for a couple of weeks before your appointment. In the diary, track the frequency of bowel movements and other symptoms. Use the Bristol Stool Chart (below) to take note of the quality of your poo. This information can help your healthcare professional assess whether you have IBS and which type.  (To learn more about the clues your poos can hide, read: 6 reasons you should care about your poop health ) In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved several new prescription medicines for IBS, along with a medical device that stimulates the cranial nerves behind the ear. In addition, thousands of research papers have looked at the interaction between IBS and various lifestyle habits, with many promising findings. Here are five evidence-based ways to reduce the symptoms of IBS (and bonus, many of them are great for enhancing overall health too). People with IBS who exercise regularly tend to experience fewer symptoms and flare-ups than people who don’t exercise. When researchers asked people with IBS to walk moderately for an hour three times a week, study participants experienced significant relief from bloating and abdominal pain within 12 weeks. 6 How exercise soothes IBS isn’t fully understood, though. According to other research, exercise may reduce stress and improve mental health, which, in turn, may help improve communication between the gut and the brain. 7 8 Another theory argues that exercise helps encourage the growth of health-promoting gut bacteria, which may help to break down food more efficiently and decrease inflammation. 9 Anxiety, stress, and depression all activate stress hormones like norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and cortisol, which can: Of course, stress doesn’t come with an on/off switch. Simply telling yourself, “Stop getting so stressed out!” won’t likely help—and may even paradoxically lead to more stress. That’s why Precision Nutrition-certified coaches like Maughan help clients learn to focus on what’s within their control—such as practicing self-compassion, or experimenting with nervous system regulators like yoga, breathing exercises, and gentle walking. As the image below illustrates, clients can control how they perceive, respond to, and anticipate stressors—but not always the stressors themselves.  Either way, when clients focus more on what they can control and less on what they can’t, they often feel calmer and more capable. (If you want to help a client figure out just what’s within their control—and what’s not—try out our free worksheet: Sphere of Control Worksheet ) (Assess your current stress load by taking our free quiz: Do you have a Stress Bod? ) PN coaches have long appreciated and advocated slower, more relaxed eating. Yes, slow eating helps people fill up on fewer calories—but it also tends to help clients reduce or even eliminate GI woes like acid reflux, bloating, and pain . For one, slower eating often translates to more chewing. In addition to mechanically mashing food into a pulp, increased chewing also allows the mouth’s digestive enzymes to pre-digest food. As a result, the stomach and intestines have to work less hard. Plus, eating in a relaxed setting often lowers stress hormones like norepinephrine and cortisol, making it less likely that they will intensify GI pain signals. According to Maughan, this can be especially important for young parents, as it’s not always easy to eat undistracted and peacefully when tending to little ones. (Sounds simple, but slow eating is more challenging than people think—and a lot more impactful. Learn more: Try the slow-eating 30-day challenge .) According to research, people with IBS experience more shallow, less restorative, and more interrupted sleep. 13 Because of poor sleep quality, many people with IBS sleep more hours overall than people without IBS—yet feel less rested. Fatigue can then set off a vicious cycle. When people don’t sleep restfully, stress hormone levels tend to be higher, which can exacerbate gut pain. 14 Unrested people also tend to feel hungrier during the day. Cravings for fats and sweets also intensify, driving people to reach for the very foods more likely to trigger IBS symptoms—and wolf them down too quickly. Stopping this cycle can be challenging. As with stress, you can’t simply will yourself to sleep more restfully. However, the first three strategies—exercise, stress management, and slower eating—can all help. Some PN clients have found that consuming a smaller dinner earlier in the evening gives their bodies more time to digest before bed. Other clients tell us that a relaxing pre-bedtime routine—a few minutes of foam rolling, a guided meditation, a bath, or some journalling—tends to help. (Find out the best practices for getting better sleep by checking out our infographic: The power of sleep ) While there’s no one-size-fits-all IBS diet, experts have identified several food categories that are more likely to be problematic for many people. These include: ▶ Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols (FODMAPs) , which are a family of carbohydrate-rich foods that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. Even in people without IBS, these foods tend to slow digestion and attract water. When gut bacteria ferment them, they produce gas, which can stretch the intestinal wall. For most, this slowed digestion and gas isn’t especially noticeable; In people with IBS, it can lead to intense pain. High-FODMAP foods include wheat, rye, barley, onions, garlic, beans, dairy, honey, cashews, some processed meats, and many fruits and vegetables. (More about FODMAPs in the next section.) ▶ Caffeinated beverages and foods , especially coffee, which trigger the release of stress hormones, stimulate the production of stomach acid, increase muscle contractions in the colon, and irritate the lining of the intestine. 15 ▶ Alcohol and spicy foods that irritate the gut. 16 17 ▶ High fructose corn syrup and sugar alcohols such sorbitol and mannitol, which have been linked to gas, bloating, and diarrhea in susceptible people. 18 19 ▶ Fatty, greasy foods , which can slow digestion and attract water, leading to loose stools, bloating, and gas. 20 21 If the idea of giving up all the foods and beverages on the above list has you in a cold sweat, know this… Not everyone with IBS is sensitive to the same foods and beverages. “Everyone can have different triggers,” says Maughan. “That’s why it’s so important to figure out what makes your body feel good and what doesn’t.” Some people struggle with apples but are okay with berries. Others can drink green tea but not black. One person might be able to consume five to eight ounces of beer but not 12. A gluten-free diet may work great for some but not others. Similarly, many people find relief by avoiding certain high-FODMAP foods. However, you may only be sensitive to some FODMAPs and not others. If so, eliminating all FODMAPs would be unnecessarily restrictive and difficult to follow consistently. For this reason, it can be helpful to try an elimination diet to see which foods and beverages are problematic—along with the quantities you can safely tolerate , says Maughan. You’ll learn more about elimination diets in the next section. (Want someone to walk you through exactly how to do an elimination diet? Read: How and why to do an elimination diet. ) In our online coaching communities, we often see people asking some version of the following question: “My client just told me that she has IBS. Am I allowed to continue to coach this person?” The answer: Yes, you certainly can. As we mentioned, Maughan specializes in helping people with digestive problems. Coaching someone with IBS is no different than coaching a client with any other nutritional goal, she says. “Because IBS is often largely associated with what someone eats, it’s within a coach’s wheelhouse—with some caveats,” says Maughan. “You can’t diagnose your client with the condition, and you should make it clear that you’re not prescribing a diet for them. In addition, you should encourage clients to seek care from a medical professional, especially if you suspect something other than IBS is going on.” To stay within your scope of practice, follow these do’s and don’ts.  Elimination diets do what the name suggests: They exclude certain foods for a short period—usually three weeks. Then, you slowly reintroduce specific foods and monitor your symptoms for possible reactions. Elimination diets work a lot like a science experiment that helps you identify problematic foods. The phrase “elimination diet” may sound scary and off-putting, as if you’ll be living for months on bland food you have to slurp through a straw. However, there are many different types of elimination diets, with some much less restrictive than others. Here are a few versions. This is an excellent option for people who suspect they already know which foods and beverages trigger symptoms. It goes like this: You eliminate up to four foods for several weeks. Then, slowly reintroduce them one at a time to see if your symptoms return. Let’s say, for example, from experience, you know you feel bad whenever you eat dairy. On the lite elimination diet, you’d eliminate just dairy for three weeks. Then you’d reintroduce it to see how you feel. If you’re unsure of how food interacts with your GI tract—but aren’t ready for a super restrictive eating plan, our Precision Nutrition elimination diet is likely the way to go. Created by PN and approved by several registered dietitians, the plan removes many of the foods most likely to cause problems, while still including a variety of vegetables, fruits, starches, legumes, nuts, seeds, and meats, so you can continue to eat a well-balanced diet. To learn more, download our FREE Ultimate Guide to Elimination Diets . This ebook has everything you need to be successful, including an at-a-glance chart that helps you easily follow the diet, along with recipes, meal ideas, and tip sheets. Over several years, researchers at Monash University in Australia have developed and extensively studied a low-FODMAP elimination diet for people with IBS. 22 Unlike other types of elimination diets, the FODMAP diet is a highly specialized form of medical nutrition therapy. The FODMAP diet’s list of problematic foods (shown below) is anything but intuitive, and the reintroduction phase is more complex than other elimination diets. As a result, if you’ve been diagnosed with IBS and suspect you have a FODMAP issue, seek the expertise of a FODMAP-certified practitioner. You can also download Monash University’s FODMAP Diet app , which will help you navigate low-FODMAP eating. In isolation, more knowledge doesn’t always lead to more power. For example, there’s a difference between knowing that dairy messes with your gut and doing something with that knowledge . Similarly, you might know that you feel better when you eat a small dinner earlier in the evening, but you may struggle to plan your life so an early dinner happens regularly. This is where a certified health coach can help. “Many of my clients already have an idea of the foods that tend to cause them problems,” says Maughan, “But they’re nervous to know for sure because they fear that the knowledge will make eating more challenging.” That’s why Maughan assures clients… Even if you do an elimination diet and you learn your favorite food is contributing to your IBS, you don’t have to do anything with that information . You can choose to continue to eat your favourite foods if you want, AND you can choose to avoid them when it’s really important for you not to experience IBS symptoms, she says. “With knowledge, you have choices,” says Maughan.

Is it all necessary? </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/the-cost-of-health-optimization\">The True Cost of “Optimal” Health</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare We hear this kind of thing a lot. People tell us they not only want to stay in good shape as they age, they also want to outlive their peers and age expectancies. Imagine you could maximize your healthspan and lifespan, fend off disease, and generally remain fit, lean, and youthful into your 90’s, 100’s, and then some. Sounds pretty compelling, doesn’t it? There’s just one problem: Common longevity advice seems to involve an extraordinary amount of effort. And time. And money. And complexity. Is all the effort necessary? Is it worth it? And, will it even work? In this article, we’ll explore: And, we’ll help you weigh the pros and cons so you can make informed decisions about your health, your body, and your life. Health and longevity advice is everywhere these days: podcasts, books, social media, that guy at the gym… Plus, influential “figureheads” have given the movement outsized attention. Think: popular podcasters and health experts Dr. Peter Attia, Dr. Andrew Huberman, and Dr. Rhonda Patrick, and biohacker Bryan Johnson. We understand the appeal of this kind of content. Who doesn’t want a longer, healthier life? (Not to mention the comforting sense of control that can come from designing and executing a “perfect” health plan.) But for us at PN, where we’ve collectively coached hundreds of thousands of people with real human lives, we know that “optimal” is rarely realistic. Not only that, optimal isn’t necessary . Making modest, relatively consistent efforts towards health and well-being will likely give you better results than following an intense, highly “optimized” protocol. If that sounds hard to believe, we get it. So let’s explore that bold statement, starting with the biggest myths surrounding longevity and health optimization. There’s an idea that getting and staying healthy must require a set of complex, “cutting edge” strategies—especially if your goal is to outlive the average American. In reality, the “basics” work really, really well. (These are things like exercising regularly; eating a nutrient-rich diet; getting adequate sleep; managing stress; and staying socially connected. We’ll discuss these more later.) Only, very few people do the basics consistently. The real reason more people aren’t living as long, or as well, as they could be isn’t because they’re not taking ice baths or getting vitamin C infusions… It’s because they’re not doing the (relatively) simple stuff, consistently. If you’re really, truly doing a well-rounded set of health-promoting behaviors with 80-90 percent consistency, you’re probably already close to peak optimization. If a handful of basic behaviors get results, then doing them perfectly and as much as possible will help you get, and stay, even healthier—right? Not so fast. There’s a law of diminishing returns when it comes to health and fitness efforts.  Plus, in our experience, doing too many things or adding in too much complexity to your health and fitness regime can: And what’s the point of living longer if you’re not living a full, well-rounded, enjoyable life? While some effort is definitely important, past a certain point, more isn’t necessarily better. Let’s say you could put all those advanced, complex strategies into action without sacrificing consistency or life enjoyment, or compromising your overall well-being. They’d have to pay off, wouldn’t they? Not necessarily. Much of the research on longevity optimization (so far) is either in mice, is observational, is theoretical, or has been tested on very small numbers of people for very short periods of time. In fact, many of the fringe methods and supplements touted by influencers or biohackers are not only unproven but even potentially unsafe. 3 4 5 6 Point being: Put your efforts towards foundational health behaviors with proven track records (the kind we’ll cover in this article) before you invest in fringe efforts. You might think, “Well, I’m not getting out of bed at 5 a.m. five times a week to go running for 60 to 90 minutes to optimize my VO₂ max, so I may as well just accept I’m not going to be a healthy person.” Some folks feel overwhelmed by the idea of optimizing their health, so they figure they might as well do nothing. However, our internal data shows that you can be far from “perfect” to get results. In our year long PN Coaching program, even clients who practiced their (basic) habits less than half of the time got measurable results.  (Read more: Nearly 1 million data points show what it REALLY takes to lose fat, get healthy, and change your body ) Instead, we encourage you to… Keep reading and we’ll guide you through it. Putting effort towards your health is great. But efforts come with tradeoffs. Here’s a look at both the efforts, and the tradeoffs, to achieve the health you want for yourself.  How do your health and longevity efforts stack up? What can you do to make the biggest difference? Take The Longevity Assessment and find out! To begin, simply click “Get started” below.  Get started © Precision Nutrition If you want to reduce your risk of chronic disease, and generally stay healthier for longer, what should you do? As we said earlier, the issue isn’t that we need some highly detailed, cutting-edge protocol. The basics work. The issue is that most people don’t do them. For example, as shown in the image below, most people don’t get enough fruits and veggies, sleep, or exercise. And the number of people who do all these things on a regular basis (while also avoiding tobacco and minimizing alcohol) is extremely low: likely a fraction of a percent.  Finally, let’s take a closer look at what these basics are, and the “sweet spot” of effort versus reward. All health experts agree: Moving your body is important. Yes, exercise will help you stay lean, and improve mood, energy, and function, but it will also help you stay alive (and healthier) for longer. In fact, a study of Harvard alumni found that any amount of physical activity reduces the risk of death from any cause. Exercise extended lifespan regardless of body weight, blood pressure, smoking habits, or genetic predisposition. 7 Another study of 272,550 older adults found engaging in even low amounts of physical activity significantly decreased risk of death from cancer, cardiovascular disease, and all causes. 8 Specifically, steep risk declines happened when accumulating at least 7.5 MET-hours* of activity per week. The greatest increase in benefits came from achieving 7.5 to 15 MET hours. Increasing activity beyond that further decreases risk, but at a continually lower rate, as the graph below shows.  *MET-hours (Metabolic Equivalent Hours) measures the energy cost of activity, based on duration and intensity. Some examples: 2 hours of resting = ~2 MET-hours; 2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic activity = ~8 MET-hours; 2 hours of moderate resistance training = ~7 MET-hours. Increasing the intensity of exercise is an efficient way to rack up MET-hours, but plain old walking counts too: In a study of 28,000 adults, every 1,000 daily step increase was associated with a 12 percent lower risk of death . (This association began at 2,500 steps and continued up to 17,000 steps.) 9 (Cool factoid: For folks concerned with dementia in particular, one study showed that getting just 3,826 steps per day was associated with a 25 percent reduced risk of dementia—and getting 9,826 steps per day was associated with a 50 percent lower risk! 10 ) Ideally, cardiovascular activity is paired with resistance or weight-bearing exercise. Resistance training supports health and longevity in various ways: it can help preserve valuable muscle mass, maintain mental sharpness, improve odds of surviving cancer, support metabolic health, and generally help you stay alive. 11 Among older adults especially, falls are a leading cause of death. 12 Resistance training can both prevent the risk of falls–because of improved balance and muscle stability 13 —as well as reduce the risk of serious injury–because of better bone density. 14 A sedentary lifestyle does the opposite, increasing risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, cancer (breast, colon, colorectal, endometrial, and epithelial ovarian cancer), and all-cause mortality. 15 In fact, two decades of sedentary lifestyle is associated with twice the risk of premature death compared to being physically active. 16 ▶ How much exercise should you do? Standard exercise recommendations suggest: 17 Getting up to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity or 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity (or some mix of both) as well as three resistance training sessions per week provides further benefits. ▶ Are people getting enough exercise? Most people are not. Only 24 percent meet the recommendations for both aerobic and resistance exercise. And fewer than 47 percent of American adults meet recommendations for aerobic physical activity. 17 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? For the most part yes, but past a certain point, more effort delivers less benefit—and potentially more risk. Overtraining (and/or under-recovering) can disrupt hormone levels, mess with sleep and mood, cause excess fatigue, chronically elevate your heart rate, cause injuries, and more. 18 19 Extreme volumes of endurance exercise training may be detrimental for the heart, and increase risk of myocardial fibrosis, coronary artery calcification, and atrial fibrillation. 20 21 22 23 So, the benefits of exercise exist on a U-shaped curve. (This is known as the “Extreme Exercise Hypothesis, ” 24 as seen in the image below.)  A “high” amount of exercise is good for you, but the “highest” amount possible probably isn’t. (Health benefits likely max out around 7-10 hours of cardio, and 3-4 resistance training sessions per week.) We like what one study concluded: “If the mantra ‘exercise is medicine’ is embraced, underdosing and overdosing are possible.” 25 Eating well doesn’t have to be complicated. There are a few key elements to nail down, and the rest is up to your own personal preferences and needs. We suggest focusing on three nutrition fundamentals. Whole and minimally-processed foods are naturally nutrient rich—complete with fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals—and far less calorie-dense than highly- or ultra-processed foods (UPFs). They also have less sugar, sodium, and trans fats—the latter which is directly linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, breast cancer, complications during pregnancy, colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, and allergy. 26 27 28 These qualities contribute to their many health benefits; Diets rich in whole or minimally-processed foods are associated with lower rates of depression, 29 30 31 heart disease, 32 type 2 diabetes, 33 cancer, 34 and improved longevity. 35 The largest study on processed foods—which included almost 10 million participants—found UPFs are linked to 32 harmful effects, including type 2 diabetes, mental health disorders, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. 36 Another study found that a higher consumption of ultra-processed foods (four or more servings daily) was associated with a 62 percent increased risk of all-cause mortality. (For each additional serving of ultra-processed food, all-cause mortality increased by 18 percent.) 37 Not that you need to be plucking tomatoes straight off the vine. Eating a minimally processed food diet is more about overall dietary patterns—and moving along the continuum of improvement—rather than rigidly avoiding all forms of processing.  ▶ How many minimally-processed foods should you eat? There currently aren’t any formal guidelines for the amount of minimally-processed foods to eat. In our experience coaching over 100,000 clients, we find people are most satisfied, and get significant health improvements, when 70 to 80 percent of their diet comes from whole or minimally-processed foods. Any improvement counts though. If you’re currently eating very few whole and minimally processed foods, getting at least 50 percent of your diet from these foods would make a big difference to your health, energy, and longevity. ▶ Are people eating enough minimally-processed foods? No. Recent US data shows that Americans get about 28.5 percent of their calories from whole or minimally-processed foods, and 56 percent of their calories from highly- or ultra-processed foods. 38 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Not beyond a certain point. If you want to, consuming up to 90 percent of calories from minimally-processed foods will truly maximize your benefits, but beyond that there are likely no further benefits. Besides, some processed foods enhance health rather than detract from it. Think about the protein powder that helps you meet your protein requirements, the commercial salad dressing that helps you eat your vegetables, or the weekly brownie à la mode you share with your grandkid that brings joy to both of your lives. (Read more: What you should know about minimally-processed foods vs. highly-processed foods ) You’ve heard it a million times. We’ll be the nag and say it again: Eat your fruits and veggies. A massive study involving over 1.8 million people showed that eating more fruits and vegetables was significantly associated with a decreased risk of death—with the benefits plateauing at five servings a day. People who ate five servings a day had a 13 percent lower risk of death from any cause compared to people who ate two servings per day. 39 Additionally, the consumption of fruits and vegetables very likely reduces the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and stroke; probably reduces the risk of cancer; and possibly prevents weight gain. 40 ▶ How many fruits and vegetables should you eat? A healthy target is five fist-sized servings of fruits and vegetables daily. (Generally, we recommend dividing that into three servings of veggies and two servings of fruit.) For bonus points, try to eat a variety of colors. The pigments in fruits and veggies come from various healthful nutrients (called phytochemicals or phytonutrients). Different colors mean different phytochemicals, giving you a diverse array of these beneficial compounds, which are likely responsible for a majority of the health benefits of fruits and vegetables. (Read more: What the colors of fruits and vegetables mean ) ▶ Are people eating enough fruits and vegetables? No. Americans only eat an average of 2.5 servings of produce (fruit and vegetables combined) per day. 41 Only 12.2 percent of people meet fruit intake recommendations, and less—9.3 percent—meet vegetable intake recommendations. A mere ten percent of Americans get a full five servings of fruits and vegetables combined per day. 42 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? There are likely diminishing returns to eating more than the above suggestions. In that massive study mentioned earlier that observed 1.8 million people, the life-extending benefits of fruits and veggies plateaued at five servings per day. 39 In other words, higher intake (beyond two servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables) was not associated with additional disease risk reduction. That said, there may be other benefits to eating more fruits and vegetables. For example, due to their fiber and water content, fruits and vegetables are filling yet low in calories, so they can support weight management—and they certainly aren’t going to harm your health. Protein is the most important macronutrient to get right, especially as we age. Plant protein in particular is linked to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and death from all causes. 43 44 45 In terms of animal proteins, the results are more mixed. (That said, research on protein intake and mortality is generally based on observational studies that don’t give us clear ideas about cause and effect.) Generally, minimally processed forms of fish, poultry, and low-fat dairy are the best animal protein sources. To minimize health risks such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, limit processed forms of red meat (like bacon, hot dogs, deli slices, and pepperoni sticks). Even un processed forms of red meat should likely be limited to about 18 oz (~4 to 5 palm-sized portions) or less per week. 46 47 48 Nonetheless, regardless of the source, getting sufficient protein—at least 1.2 g of protein per kg of body weight—significantly reduces the risk for sarcopenia (muscle loss), frailty, and neuromuscular decline. 49 50 Protein is also vital for maintaining and building muscle, keeping bones and soft tissues healthy, supporting immunity, and more. It’s also the most satiating macronutrient, and thus helpful for fat loss and/or body recompositioning. ▶ How much protein should you eat? The current USDA recommendation for protein intake is at least 0.8 grams of protein per kg of body weight (0.35 g/lb). However, newer research suggests this is likely the absolute minimum amount, and only for relatively young sedentary individuals. A better minimum intake for most is likely 1.2 g/kg (0.55 g/lb, or about 3 to 5 palm-sized portions of protein-rich foods), especially for older adults, as they’re at greater risk of muscle loss. Protein intake for muscle growth and retention, and/or if performing resistance training or other vigorous exercise would be 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg (0.75-1 g/lb), or about 4 to 8 palm-sized portions of protein-rich foods. ▶ Are people eating enough protein? That depends on how “enough” is defined. Most adults eat at least 0.8 g/kg. However, up to 10 percent of young women and up to 46 percent of older adults don’t hit this mark. 51 And, as noted, that recommendation is probably conservative compared to the ideal intake. Protein is also especially critical for those on GLP-1 medications (Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound) to help prevent the muscle loss they can lead to. Aiming for at least 1.2 g/kg is vital for this population, especially if they are also older. (Getting closer to 1.6 g/kg is even better, if possible.) ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Once you get up to 1.2 g/kg, not necessarily. That amount is likely adequate for most, especially sedentary folks. If you’re trying to build muscle and strength or recover from vigorous exercise, or are taking GLP-1 medication for fat loss, striving towards 1.6 g/kg would help you achieve that goal more easily. If you’re trying to maximize strength and muscle gains, and/or are doing lots of strenuous exercise, consuming 1.6-2.2 g/kg is optimal (with the highest end of that range maxing out all benefits). Supplements make up a large part of the discussion around aging, but in reality only play a small role when it comes to increasing health and longevity. Using supplements (like a multivitamin, or doctor recommended vitamin D or iron) to prevent or correct deficiencies can be helpful for overall health well-being. Then, there are other supplements that have reasonably strong track records and can help us meet nutritional needs (protein powder), improve performance (creatine), or potentially even slow aging (fish oil might slow biological aging by a small amount). 52 However, the buzziest, trendiest supplements are often less proven. For example, curcumin, spirulina, and ginger are often listed as supplements that might help with inflammation, a hallmark of aging. However, the research here is still early, and far from definitive. There are also even less substantiated supplements that might modify other aspects of aging (resveratrol, NAD+, NAC), but the evidence is either very minimal or only in animal models. Some supplements (especially herbal supplements) can even cause harm, like liver damage. 53 If you want to give supplements a try, check for high-quality third-party seals of approval from organizations such as NSF . Examine.com —an online database that provides independent research summaries and analyses on most popular supplements—is also an excellent resource to help you determine which supplements might actually be effective. Regardless, talk to your healthcare provider before taking supplements, particularly if you take other medication.  Research shows that men who get enough quality sleep live almost five years longer than men who don’t, and women who get enough live two and a half years longer. 54 Studies also show sleep is just as important for your heart health as exercise, whole foods, weight management, cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar control. 55 Compared to 7 hours of sleep per day, a 1 hour decrease in sleep duration has been associated with an 11 percent increased risk of cardiovascular disease and a 9 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes. 56 Older adults who sleep less than 6 hours per night are at higher risk for dementia and cognitive decline than those who sleep 7 to 8 hours. 57 (Deep sleep helps clear beta-amyloid plaques and wash out toxins from our brain, thought to be partially responsible for dementia.) ▶ How much sleep should you get? Sleep experts agree that 7 to 9 hours a night on average—with at least 7 hours of sleep most nights of the week—is ideal for most. However, the exact ideal hours may vary person to person. Generally, the right amount of sleep for you is the amount that allows you to feel relatively refreshed shortly after waking up, and allows you to fall asleep relatively easily at bedtime, with relatively sustained energy throughout the day. ▶ Are people getting enough sleep? About a third of US adults don’t meet the recommended amount of 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. 58 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Not necessarily. It seems that 7 to 9 hours of sleep a night is ideal in terms of health outcomes. 56 Interestingly, longer sleep duration (over 9 hours per night on average) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and overall mortality. 59 60 61 However, it’s not clear that these risks are caused by sleeping more. Just as likely, it may be other health problems (such as depression, sleep apnea, or heavy alcohol consumption) that lead to both longer sleep times and higher health risks. (Read more: Transform your sleep—The scientific way to energize your body, sharpen your mind, and stop hitting snooze ) When left unchecked for long periods of time (say, months or years without periods of recovery), stress can have negative effects on nearly every aspect of our health, as the below image shows.  Chronic stress—which tends to increase heart rate, blood pressure, and inflammation—increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. 62 63 64 Additionally, long-term stress tends to worsen mental and emotional health, increasing the risk of anxiety and depression. 65 It can also make people more likely to turn to substances like alcohol as an attempt to cope. 66 That said… Not all stress is bad. In fact, stress is a normal, natural, and even beneficial part of life; the right amount helps us feel motivated, purposeful, and engaged with life. So, rather than avoiding or demonizing stress, it’s helpful to work with it, using it as an opportunity to develop healthy coping mechanisms, appropriate recovery strategies, and overall resilience. And this doesn’t necessarily mean sitting on a cushion and meditating. Stress management can include simple mindset shifts: Practicing self-compassion, 67 having a growth mindset, 68 and framing stress as a normal and even beneficial part of life 69 have all been associated with better coping under stress. Basic self-regulation skills also help. This involves noticing and naming what you’re feeling, having good control over your actions, and using a broad range of coping skills to help yourself process emotions and recover from stress. With these skills, you build self-awareness and the ability to handle challenges better, because you know how to calm yourself down after an activating event—regardless of how it went. The below image offers a spectrum of more—small and big—ways to regulate stress.  ▶ How much stress management should you engage in? Think of stress management and recovery as a thing you do in proportion to the stress and demands of your life. We often use the analogy of a jug: When stress drains your tank, stress management and recovery practices help fill it back up again. And, as with all of the foundational health habits we’ve discussed, every little bit counts. Whether you’re experiencing a little or a lot of stress in your life, even three to five minutes of purposeful recovery—doing deep breathing exercises, some journaling or gentle stretching, or just stepping outside to get some fresh air and listen to the birds—can help fill your tank. ▶ Are people doing enough to manage stress? Probably not. In the US, over a quarter of people report that most days, they’re so stressed they can’t function. 70 In Canada, it’s similar: Just under a quarter of people say that most days in their life are either “quite a bit” or “extremely” stressful. 71 Additionally, over a third of people say they don’t know where to start when it comes to managing their stress. 72 ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Not necessarily. The goal is to find your stress “sweet spot.” Because we all enjoy and tolerate different types and amounts of stress, how you feel is actually a pretty good indicator of whether stress is too low, too high, or “just right.” As the image below shows, if you generally feel bored and purposeless, stress is likely too low; if you feel energized and engaged, stress is probably close to your “sweet spot”; and if you feel panicky or so overwhelmed you’ve started to feel hopeless, stress is likely too high.  While having a routine for stress management is a smart idea, there’s likely a point of diminishing returns here too. If you’re in that stress “sweet spot” (energized/engaged, not bored and not overwhelmed), then adding more stress reduction techniques might not help further—and may actually add stress by giving you yet another task to do. You might not think of social connection as a health imperative, but it is. Not only is the social and emotional support associated with improved well-being, it’s also associated with reduced risk of premature death. 73 74 When relationships are strong, people have a 50 percent increased likelihood of survival during any given time. 75 In fact, one of the longest running studies—the Study of Adult Development out of Harvard Medical School, which has been tracking participants for over 87 years (and counting)— found that strong relationships were the biggest predictor of not only life satisfaction but longevity. (Relationships were more predictive of these outcomes than social class, wealth, IQ, or genetics.) 76 No surprise, not having a social circle comes with its own distinct risks. Social isolation and loneliness can increase a person’s risk for heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, depression and anxiety, suicidality and self-harm, dementia, and earlier death. 77 78 A frequently cited statistic highlights its profound impact: The effect of social isolation on mortality is comparable to smoking up to 15 cigarettes per day 79 —surpassing even the risks associated with obesity and physical inactivity. 80 ▶ Are people getting enough social connection? It seems many of us could use more friends. About 1 in 3 adults report feeling lonely, and 1 in 4 report not having social and emotional support. 77 Eight percent of adults say they have no close friends, 53 percent say they have between one and four close friends, and 38 percent report having five or more friends. 81 ▶ How much social connection should you aim for? Generally speaking, research finds that people who have three to five close friends they regularly interact with (one to three times per week, in-person or via phone call) get the most social benefit. 82 83 84 85 On average, interaction with a smaller group of people tends to provide more benefit than a large network of acquaintances. 86 That said, individual needs vary. If you feel authentically connected to others, have a strong sense of belonging, and generally feel socially fulfilled, that’s what matters most. ▶ Is getting more than the recommended amount better? Likely not. Some evidence suggests that excessive social engagement (daily or multiple times daily) actually might increase mortality risk. 87 That’s probably because over-socializing can increase mental, emotional, and physical fatigue, 88 and often this level of socialization includes alcohol or other potentially risky behaviors. Additionally, it can take away time and energy that could be put towards other life-building and health-promoting behaviors (like work, exercise, or sleep). The takeaway? Strive for socializing that brings value to your life. No need to add so much that you wind up exhausted, or unable to keep up with other priorities. Minimizing activities we know to be harmful is a key part of looking after your long-term health, yet it can be easy to overlook these things. (Maybe because we’d rather keep doing them.) Two of the biggest culprits are smoking and drinking alcohol. We all know smoking is bad for us. But smoking is still relatively common: The WHO estimates more than 8 million people die prematurely yearly from tobacco use (with an additional 56,000 people dying annually from chewing tobacco). 91 This makes tobacco a leading (i.e. top 3) risk factor for premature death and all-cause mortality. 92 Smoking is also a risk factor for several chronic conditions, including coronary heart disease, stroke, emphysema, and cancer. 93 (Globally, about a quarter of cancer deaths are attributed to smoking. 90 ) At this point, the research is pretty clear: Alcohol has negative implications for your health, especially past a certain point of regular use.  Alcohol plays a causal role in 200+ diseases, particularly liver diseases, heart diseases, at least seven types of cancers, depression, anxiety, alcohol use disorders, and dementia. 94 95 In 2019, 2.6 million deaths worldwide were attributable to alcohol consumption. 96 For people in the 15-49 age range, alcohol is the leading risk factor for death, with 3.8 percent of female deaths and 12.2 percent of male deaths attributable to alcohol use. 97 ▶ How much alcohol is “safe” to drink? US guidance on alcohol suggests keeping intake at moderate levels, or less. 98 A moderate intake means: Importantly, a drink is defined as containing 14 grams (about 0.6 fluid ounces) of pure ethanol, which equates to: ▶ Are people limiting their alcohol enough? In the US, people tend to drink more than the recommended guidelines. In 2021, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism reported that the average American aged 21 or older consumed 2.51 gallons of pure alcohol over the course of a year—equivalent to about 10 standard drinks/week. 99 However, research suggests surveys typically underestimate consumption by 40 to 50 percent. 100 Further, other research shows that the heavier a person drinks, the more significantly they’re likely to underestimate and/or underreport their drinking. 101 All that to say, the average American is likely having more (or even far more) than 10 drinks per week. Add to that: ▶ Is more abstinence from alcohol better? In 2023, the WHO released a statement saying no amount of alcohol is “safe.” 104 This interpretation is still debated, and data continues to emerge. Here’s our take: An abstinence-only policy is likely a failed policy for many. Rather, we want people to be informed so they can make intentional decisions. To be clear, alcohol is not beneficial for physical health; it’s a known human carcinogen. However, while alcohol does increase health risks, risk does not rise in a linear fashion with intake. Meaning, small doses are unlikely to have a significant impact on your health. But when you drink more heavily, the risks rise exponentially. 105 Drinking heavily can mean either: (Reminder: A single drink refers to those definitions mentioned previously. Pints of beer, and heavily poured wine glasses and cocktails are more than single servings… Just because it fits in a single glass doesn’t mean it counts as “one” drink.) Ultimately, it’s about finding the level of risk you’re willing to tolerate relative to whatever benefits you feel alcohol provides you. Our general recommendations: In all the chatter about longevity optimization, it can be easy to forget about all the boring—but no less important—things that help you stay safe and healthy throughout your life. These include things like: … And generally using common sense. (As in, avoid the “hold my beer” type stuff.) Basic health maintenance and risk avoidance practices matter—a lot. Notably, we can’t control every element of our environment. Some factors influencing our health are more structural and systemic, woven into the fabric of our societies. These are called social determinants of health , and include poverty, racism, homophobia, lack of accommodation for disabilities, and displacement (as in the case of refugees). For some folks, doing the above protective behaviors—like visiting the family doctor, getting glasses, going to the dentist, or even walking safely down the street—will be harder, sometimes near impossible. This isn’t meant to be a throwaway line that diminishes the difficult reality for so many people, but rather a gritty, realistic mantra: Do the best you can with what you’ve got. ▶ How much preventative health care do you need to do? Generally speaking, aim to be consistent with the habits you know you “should” do. You know the drill: Brush and floss daily; wear your helmet every time you ride a bike; wear your seatbelt every time you drive; put on sunscreen when you go out into the midday sun; don’t regularly blast your music at full volume; and so on. And if you have lingering things on your “I should really do that” list (like getting that weird mole checked out, or that bloodwork done), go do it. ▶ Are people practicing enough basic preventative health measures? We’ve offered a long-ish list of basic health practices that can protect health, so we won’t go into each in-depth. That said, when looking at the above list, it’s probably fair to say most people will notice a few behaviors they might practice more consistently. For example, while most of us are really consistent with our seat belts (usage is close to 92 percent! 116 ), many of us could break out the floss more often (only 32 percent of Americans floss daily 117 ). And, research shows that only about half of cyclists and motorcyclists wear helmets when riding 118 119 120 (and use is even lower among skateboarders and rollerbladers 121 ). Hearing loss is the number one modifiable risk factor for dementia, 122 so make sure you also follow the “60/60 rule” if you like to pump up the tunes on your headphones: Listen at 60 percent of your device’s maximum volume for 60 minutes, then take a break. (And wear earplugs when you mow the lawn!) ▶ Are more preventative measures better? Once again, there’s likely a law of diminishing returns when it comes to preventative health measures, just like everything else. The point isn’t to become obsessed with eliminating all possible risks at every turn. Rather, it’s that reasonable efforts towards protecting your health do count, and they‘re immeasurably more important for overall health than the latest optimization fads. Research consistently shows that having a strong sense of purpose and meaning for our life improves our health, overall well-being, and longevity too. 123 A sense of purpose seems to help people live longer, even when controlling for other markers of psychological well-being. There’s something uniquely beneficial about having a strong purpose that’s different from, say, being happy . Having a strong sense of purpose can mean many things, but it generally indicates that you have goals, and an aim in life. This purpose can be many things: Having purpose may help with longevity for a few reasons: It makes you more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviors, such as getting enough sleep and eating more fruits and vegetables. 123 It also tends to improve mental health. For example, one study showed that people with the strongest sense of purpose had a 43 percent reduced risk of depression. 123 Finally, it may simply help people live longer because it makes you want to live longer . When people have a sense of purpose, they often want to live longer, healthier lives, so they can fulfill that purpose to its fullest. And while wanting to live won’t make it so, it certainly doesn’t hurt.  We hope it’s clear by now: You can take yourself really far with some solid basics (that will themselves take some decent time and effort!). But, if you want to go even further, your effort might have to increase exponentially, just as those gains become less certain, and more marginal. Here’s what to keep in mind. Let’s compare the time and financial investment of two imaginary people. The first person is what you might call a “healthy” or “medium effort” person. They’re someone who is pretty consistently meeting all of the above recommendations. The second person is what you might call an “optimizer.” They do all the above recommendations, but to the max, and many of the fringe recommendations often discussed on health-related podcasts and books. How much time and money might each of these people invest in their health efforts on a weekly basis? Here’s what that might look like.  On top of that, there are “optimizing” behaviors and assessments that might be performed less often—say, monthly, seasonally, annually, or even every few years. Of course, these practices will still require time and money, so even though they’re less frequent, they still have to be accounted for. Here are some examples of those kinds of products, therapies, and tests: Though it’s hard to estimate the cost of these items, opting to do just a handful could easily cost an extra $10,000+ per year. Overall, we’d estimate it takes at least three to four times the time, effort, and money to follow an “optimizer” type lifestyle, compared to a plain old “healthy” lifestyle. As we’ve seen above, this 3-4x effort will likely translate to some extra benefits, but the medium-effort “healthy” lifestyle will likely get most people at least 80 percent of the results they’re after (such as improved lifespan, healthspan, and quality of life). The harder and more extreme someone’s fitness or health regime, the harder they typically fall off the wagon. So, taking on too much can actually put you more at risk of quitting the foundational health behaviors we mentioned earlier. Even if you stick with it, over-focusing on health and longevity will almost certainly interfere with your ability to enjoy a full, well-rounded, meaningful life. For example, if you get too focused on physical health, you may find other aspects of your deep health and overall wellbeing suffer, such as your relational, existential, mental, and emotional health.  Take this a step further, and “optimizing” can tip over into obsession. Sometimes, under the surface of “I just really care about my health” is disordered eating, orthorexia, or another mental health condition.  This, to us, is the heart of things: It’s important to not only stay relatively healthy, but also to enjoy your life while you’re living it. In fact, enjoying your life isn’t separate from good health. It’s part of it. Take a step back and consider what you really want most for yourself. What kind of life do you want to have? How important is it to maximize your healthspan and lifespan, and how does that line up with your other priorities? Given what you want most for yourself, and the resources you have available, what’s realistic for you? How much time, money, and effort are you willing to put in to achieve health and lifespan goals? What are you prepared to give up? What aren’t you prepared to give up? Review the foundational health behaviors in this article. How many of them are you already doing? Consistently? If you’re covering most of the basics, you might not need to do more. (Give yourself a pat on the back. You’re already elite!) Or, maybe there’s some room for improvement and you’d like to step it up a bit. Great! For the vast majority of people, improving any of these behaviors will deliver real, tangible results. Start with these, before chasing faddish, fringe, “super-optimal” stuff. Those people you hear on podcasts or social media aren’t the experts on you and your life. You get to decide what you want, and how to go about getting it. Be honest with yourself, and make choices aligned with what matters most to you.

Vegetable oil vs. olive oil vs. butter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare From TikTok to bestseller lists, vegetable oils—a.k.a. “seed oils”—are a big topic right now. To be fair, folks have debated the merits of vegetable oils dating back to when they first entered the marketplace. More recently, however, with the advent of the carnivore diet , vegetable oil hate has roared back into the socials. Maybe you’ve come across posts that refer to these cooking oils as “toxic sludge,” “motor oil,” “the hateful eight,” and “the biggest cause of chronic disease that nobody knows about.” The anti-vegetable oil logic goes something like this… Animal fats have been with humans for thousands of years. Vegetable fats, on the other hand, were invented during the last century when profit-seeking companies wanted to find a way to sell cheap-to-grow foods to unsuspecting consumers. Another argument: Like margarine, vegetable oils were marketed as healthier alternatives for butter, and yet, people argue, these oils are worse than butter, raising your risk for obesity, anxiety, depression, ulcerative colitis, and more. In contrast to the above line of thought, other experts will tell you that vegetable oils are harmless, potentially even health-promoting—and absolutely better than butter. So, who’s right? Like so many nutrition topics, the truth is too nuanced to fit on a meme. In this story, we’ll help you sort the science from the pseudoscience so you can make informed decisions about the oils you choose to include in your diet. Sometimes called “seed oils,” vegetable oils start, as you might suspect, from the seed of a plant. The most common ones you’ll find in a typical grocery aisle include: By the way, if you feel like there’s a bunch of oils missing from that list, it’s probably because those oils come from non-seed plants (such as olive, avocado, palm, or coconut oil, which all come from fruits, and aren’t considered vegetable or seed oils). Non-vegetable oils—such as olive and avocado oil—are derived from naturally fatty foods. In fact, olives are so oily that you could theoretically make your own olive oil at home. (Just Google “how to make olive oil from scratch,” and you’ll find a number of videos walking you through the steps.) The same can’t be said of most vegetable oils, which mostly come from foods with a relatively tiny fat content to begin with. Case in point: A cup of green olives contains about 20 grams of fat, 1 whereas a cup of corn has 2 grams. 2 As a result, manufacturers must use an extensive multi-step process to extract this small amount of oil from these non-oily foods. These steps include: During this process, health-promoting polyphenols and other stabilizing nutrients are lost, and small amounts of unsaturated fats are transformed into trans fatty acids (also called partially hydrogenated fat). (Interesting fact: This also happens during deep frying. When vegetable oils sizzle in a restaurant’s deep fryer for hours, the trans fat content of the oil increases.) To call these processed oils “toxic” might be an exaggeration. However, nutrition scientists generally agree that people should avoid trans fats in the diet, and in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration banned manufacturers from adding trans fats to processed foods. 3 4 At PN, we’ve created several visual guides people can use to make informed decisions about what to eat. (We’ve also created a shopping list, which you or your clients can print out and take to the grocery store. Check it out: Healthy Fats Shopping List ) In these guides, we’ve placed a few vegetable oils—expeller-pressed canola oil, high-oleic sunflower, and safflower oils—in the “Eat Some” section. For us, “eat some” is another way of saying that these foods will neither improve health nor harm health—when consumed in reasonable amounts. In some cases, like in the example of dark chocolate, when consumed in small amounts, they might even improve health. The rest of the vegetable oils, along with butter and other saturated fats, fall into the “Eat Less” category, as the image below shows. You’ll find vegetable oils in bold.  We’ve gotten hate mail from folks who say certain vegetable oils—especially cold-pressed canola oil—should appear alongside olive oil in the “eat more” category. Plenty of others say all vegetable oils belong in the “eat less” column, and that butter belongs in “eat some” or even “eat more.” To understand the scientific reasoning behind our recommendations, let’s explore some head-to-head matchups. These oils are the least refined of their kind. To make extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), manufacturers grind and mechanically press olives, without using any heat. Similarly, expeller-pressed canola oil is made by mechanically pressing rapeseed, without the use of heat or chemical solvents. Olive oil is richer in heart-healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) than almost any other cooking oil. In addition, unlike the more refined “light” olive oil, EVOO maintains most of the olive fruit’s original polyphenols. These plant-based substances help to combat inflammation and protect cells from damage. Perhaps most importantly… More studies vouch for EVOO’s health-promoting qualities than for any other cooking fat. For example, researchers asked 22,892 adults from Southern Italy to self-report their olive oil consumption. People who consumed the most olive oil (more than two tablespoons a day) were 20 percent less likely to die over the 13-year study than people who consumed the least olive oil (less than one tablespoon a day). 5 Other research has linked the consumption of olive oil with a reduced risk of: Consumption of olive oil is also associated with reductions in LDL cholesterol, especially when used to replace saturated fats like butter and coconut oil. 10 Years ago, culinary experts recommended using EVOO only on salads and other uncooked foods. Back then, they assumed EVOO’s relatively low smoke point (350 to 410F) meant the oil would break down when heated, losing some of its distinctive flavor and health benefits. We now know that smoke point isn’t as big a deal as previously thought. That’s especially true in the case of EVOO, whose polyphenols and high concentrations of monounsaturated fats help keep the oil stable when heated. In research that heated a variety of cooking oils to 464 F (240C) and then held them at 356 F (180C) for several hours, EVOO remained more stable than any other oil tested, including canola oil. 11  One of the more affordable cooking oils on the shelf, canola oil, is made from a Canadian-made hybrid of the rapeseed plant. (The word “canola” refers to the first three letters of “Canada” with a fun “ola” added to the end for marketing purposes.) 12 Among vegetable oils, canola is the richest in heart-healthy monounsaturated fats (though several non-vegetable oils have it beat) as well as alpha-linolenic acid, a plant-based omega-3 fatty acid. In addition, canola oil contains plant substances called phytosterols that help influence blood cholesterol for the better, especially when used as a substitute for butter, research has found. 13 14 15 Extra virgin olive oil is the clear winner. The body of research in support of EVOO dwarfs the body of research in support of expeller-pressed canola. In addition, EVOO has a more favorable fatty acid profile. By the way, so does avocado oil, which is why you’ll also find it in the “eat more” column. However, you can buy roughly twice as much expeller-pressed canola oil for half as much money as EVOO. Because of this, expeller-pressed canola can be a good budget-friendly choice. In addition, because of expeller-pressed canola’s more neutral flavor, many people prefer it over EVOO for baking. When used in moderation, expeller-pressed canola can be part of a healthy diet. It is likely to be at least health neutral, if not somewhat health beneficial. This match-up comes down to how processing methods affect the end product. An expeller press is a machine that squeezes oil out of seeds. It’s able to do this without the use of solvents or heat, which helps preserve beneficial compounds such as alpha-linolenic acid and phytosterols. Refining removes some protective alpha-linoleic acid while adding small amounts of unhealthy trans fatty acids. This results in a product that is proportionally lower in omega-3 fatty acids and higher in omega-6 fatty acids. Expeller-pressed canola oil wins, but only by a small margin. That’s because canola oil starts with a less controversial fatty acid profile than many other vegetable oils, as the chart below shows. Soybean oil, for example, has less heart-healthy monounsaturated fat and much more theoretically inflammation-contributing omega-6 fat.  The typical American consumes around 16 to 20 times more omega-6 fats than omega-3s. This imbalance could theoretically increase inflammation in your body, potentially raising your risk for diabetes, obesity, and other health problems, argue some experts. 16 Years ago, the recommendation to balance your omega 6s with omega 3s was widespread. (The suggested “ideal” ratio: Anywhere from 1:1 to 4:1, in favor of omega 6s.) These days, there’s more debate among nutritional scientists as to whether this imbalance contributes to chronic inflammation, especially when those omega 6s are consumed in whole foods that contain many other beneficial compounds. For example, nuts and seeds—both naturally rich in omega-6 fats—have been associated with a range of health benefits , including reductions in blood cholesterol and inflammation. 17 18 In 2019, Harvard Health ran the headline “ No need to avoid healthy omega-6 fats .” In support of their argument, a 2019 study from the American Heart Association journal Circulation determined that, if anything, the consumption of omega-6 fats reduced the risk for stroke, heart disease, and early death. 19 However, while nuts and refined canola oil may share a somewhat similar fatty acid profile, the two foods differ in one important way. As we mentioned earlier, refined canola oil is basically pure oil. Meanwhile, nuts and seeds come packaged with health-protective fiber, polyphenols, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Minimally-processed foods, like nuts or extra virgin oils, include a complex matrix of health-promoting nutrients. Highly-processed oils, on the other hand, have lost the vast majority of those healthful compounds, leaving mostly just the fatty acids which are more prone to oxidation (we’ll cover that next).  This is the match-up that triggers the most arguing on the interwebs. Let’s cover the major claims from both sides—plus what the research says. Butter proponents argue that saturated fats have been unnecessarily vilified. They point to nutrition recommendations during the 1980s and 1990s that recommended people replace butter with trans-fat rich margarine. (We all know how that went.) Margarine aside, others claim the research in support of reducing saturated fats is thin at best. 20 However, excessive saturated fat consumption (beyond 10 percent of total calories) does seem to boost cholesterol levels and may increase your risk of heart disease. 21 Some research has found that replacing 5 percent of the saturated fats in your diet with monounsaturated fats could reduce the risk of heart disease by 15 percent. Similarly, replacing 5 percent of the saturated fats in your diet with polyunsaturated fats (with most of that coming from refined vegetable oils) reduces the risk of a future heart attack by 10 percent, according to an analysis of eight studies involving 13,614 people. 22 Many other studies support this finding. 23 But not all saturated fats affect blood cholesterol equally. In some dairy foods, a membrane—called a milk fat globule membrane —surrounds the saturated fats and seems to limit their cholesterol-raising properties. However, butter is low in this protective membrane, and consequently raises blood cholesterol more than other high-fat dairy products, like full-fat milk, cream, yogurt, or cheese. 24 25 26 The U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommend capping saturated fat at less than 10 percent of your calorie intake. A tablespoon of butter contains 7 grams of saturated fat—a third of the recommended daily limit in a 2000 Calorie diet. So, while you don’t necessarily need to eliminate butter, it’s worth moderating your intake. (Interested in learning about all the nuances of saturated fat consumption? Read: Is saturated fat good or bad for you? ) Due to their chemical structure, polyunsaturated fats are inherently less stable and more prone to oxidation than saturated or monounsaturated fats. During the refining process, protective phytochemicals and antioxidants are stripped, making these oils more prone to oxidation. The theory is that this oxidation increases inflammation in the body and elevates the risk of various health conditions. There’s some evidence to suggest that diets rich in polyunsaturated fats, especially from refined vegetable oils, are associated with increased levels of oxidized blood lipids, lipid peroxidation, and other markers of inflammation. 27 28 If you only use refined corn or safflower oils to lightly coat veggies before roasting them, you likely don’t have much to worry about. However, for the vast majority of people, the biggest source of refined vegetable oils isn’t home-cooked meals—it’s ultra-processed foods. The extra processing and repeated heat exposure used to create ultra-processed foods further oxidize these oils. Additionally, these foods are often loaded with potentially harmful ingredients like added sodium and sugars, and low in beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Plus, they’re incredibly calorie-dense and difficult to stop eating, which can raise your risk for obesity. (Find out exactly why highly-processed foods are so “addictive”: Why you can’t stop eating ultra-processed foods .) Most ultra-processed foods list one or more vegetable oils as one of their ingredients. Even ultra-processed foods that you wouldn’t think of as “fatty” contain small amounts. You’ll find them in store-bought cookies, chips, crackers, sauces, frozen dinners, meal replacement shakes, boxed macaroni and cheese, salad dressing, boxed rice blends, and more. In a large review involving nearly 10 million people, the consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with a higher risk of premature death. 29 In addition, studies have linked high consumption of ultra-processed foods with the following health problems: 30 31 32 33 You don’t have to abolish ultra-processed foods. But your health will benefit from capping your consumption to about 20 percent or so of your intake, with the other 80 percent or so from mostly minimally-processed whole foods. This alone will naturally lower your refined vegetable oil intake to a safer level, without much fuss. Plus, consuming refined vegetable oils in the context of a diet that’s rich in colorful plants, fiber, phytochemicals, and antioxidants may help offset the concern of oxidation. (For example, by putting a reasonable amount of commercial salad dressing on a large, colorful salad.) This match-up is a draw. Ultimately, both should be limited in the diet, and neither are health- promoting. Most refined vegetable oils are lopsidedly rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids compared to monounsaturated fats, and are stripped of many protective compounds. As mentioned earlier, some experts argue that these omega-6-rich fats may contribute to inflammation (but the evidence here is mixed). Because of how they’re processed, seed oils also contain some of those trans fats that everyone agrees we should all minimize. In contrast, butter is low in omega 6s but high in saturated fat, which can be problematic in higher amounts. Especially since it’s so low in the protective milk fat globule membrane. However, compared to refined vegetable oil, butter is less processed. Like olive oil, it’s one of those fats you could theoretically make at home. This might be obvious from the head-to-head matchups, but we’ll say it anyway. If you like it and can afford it, EVOO is a great choice. Cold-pressed avocado oil and walnut oil are also great options, as both are rich in antioxidant compounds. Like EVOO, avocado oil is a rich source of MUFAs. Walnut oil’s fat primarily comes from polyunsaturated fats, so it’s best used as a dressing rather than used for cooking (as it’s less heat stable). However, like EVOO, avocado and walnut oil tend to be expensive. If you or your client are budget-conscious, expeller-pressed canola oil is a solid runner-up. Similarly, high-oleic sunflower and safflower oils are richer sources of monounsaturated fats than their high-linoleic cousins. When substituted for saturated fats like butter, high-oleic oils have been associated with cardiovascular benefits. 34 35 Regardless of what cooking fats you or your client choose, you’ll also want to do the following: Whole and minimally-processed foods—such as nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, and salmon—are more likely to feature health-promoting monounsaturated (MUFAs) and omega-3 fats. They also come packaged with a wide array of other good-for-you nutrients such as fiber, protein, minerals, and antioxidants. In contrast, ultra-professed foods are generally devoid of everything you keep hearing you should consume more of. These foods also tend to be calorie-dense, highly rewarding, and hard to stop eating. If you’re not sure whether packaged food is minimally processed or highly processed, take a close look and consider: If you answer “no” to most of the above, the food is likely highly processed. It doesn’t matter what source of fat is used to fry them. Sort all fried foods into the “eat less” category. EVOO is associated with longer, healthier lives. However, that doesn’t mean you should be doing shots of it. As a general rule, you’re better off getting most of your fat from foods like avocados, olives, nuts and seeds than from any cooking oil. Whole food fats are rich in fiber, phytochemicals, vitamins, and minerals, and are generally less calorie-dense than oils. (But having one to three servings of oils or butter per day is reasonable.)

In the best cases, these devices offer a bridge between what you subjectively feel and what you can objectively measure. This is generally a really cool and amazing thing. Our subjective feelings and assessments matter, but they’re not always the most reliable. Us humans just aren’t particularly skilled at quantifying our experiences and behaviors with cold precision. Take, for example, a colleague of mine. He believed he was eating within a narrow caloric window, but after careful tracking, he learned that he was putting away a bonus 500 Calories a day—in barbecue sauce. That said, some of us are better than others. Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter, was reported to have been able to call out his 100 metre time within a tenth of a second of the stopwatch readout. 1 That’s outlier performance, to be clear, but it still makes you wonder: And, how can you improve your accuracy through the wise use of technology—like fitness trackers—to help you make better decisions about your health? In the following article, we’ll tackle the above, plus we’ll address: Let’s get into it. Not all data is created equal. Some brands produce better products than others. This is not just hardware but also the quality of their software and datasets. Beyond that, not all things are equally easy to quantity. For example, heart rate and step-count data are generally reliable, 2 but many other types of outputs—from calories burned to movement velocity—have substantial margins for error. The below chart shows the reliability of various tracking devices. (If you’re curious, we cover the accuracy of various progress indicators in more detail here: Are Fitness Trackers Worth It? ) The good: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. The bad: Tracking devices offer us more data about our behaviors and bodies than ever before. “What’s really remarkable,” says Samantha Kleinberg, a computer scientist who studies decision-making, “is that even a tiny amount of surplus information has a big negative effect on our decision-making.” 3 That’s the paradox of tracking: Too little detail makes it tough to make the right decision, but so does too much. This can be expressed as an inverted U, with the sweet spot at the top of the curve. Consider the analysis paralysis you feel after scanning hundreds of reviews from the various taco places in your neighborhood. (All you wanted was a decent el pastor, but now you don’t know which taqueria to pick!) Finding just enough information to make good decisions is an art form—especially in the world of health and fitness, where it seems like everyone is trying to outdo each other when it comes to providing more science, more customization, and more complexity. But when all that information starts to blur together with no clear path forward, what should you do? For starters, you can ask yourself a simple question: Does tracking increase my wellbeing and performance? If the answer is a clear yes or no, you know what to do. (Either continue tracking as you were, or drop the gadget and walk away.) If you’re a little fuzzy, here are three signs to watch for to help you determine if tracking is helpful—or not. When Zak’s coach raved about the benefits of zone 2 cardio, it sounded logical. But when the rubber on his running shoes hit the road, Zak second-guessed everything. Zak prided himself on his ability to grind, and simply didn’t trust that something that felt easy could also be effective. Yet, the data didn’t lie. As the weeks went by, Zak watched his resting heart rate drop—along with his recovery time from hard runs. With that reassurance, Zak began to relax about the process—and his resting heart rate dropped further. Zak hadn’t trusted his feelings, but he did trust the data from his heart rate monitor. Using a tracking device enabled Zak to calibrate his own perceptions so they were more accurate and realistic. If you’re a coach who has a client like Zak who’s high performing but doesn’t know it, tracking can help build confidence and reduce the anxiety that they’re “not good enough.” Here, you empower them by shining a spotlight on existing performance. Expert assurance can go a long way but can also be bolstered by reliable data. (Recently, many people have begun using continuous glucose monitors, or CGMs, in order to “optimize” their blood sugar levels. This can help “validate” certain food choices… but it can also be a waste of time. Read more: Should people without diabetes use CGMs? ) Sometimes, data can stress you out without any upside—like when you receive poor scores about things beyond your control. Take the new parent of a newborn who gets a poor sleep quality score. Tracking has a time and a place. When scores are beyond your control or your priorities lie elsewhere, tracking can create unnecessary stress and is counterproductive. You can always revisit tracking when circumstances or priorities change. For a behaviour to take place, you need three things 4 : Fitness trackers shine when you’ve got plenty of motivation and ability—and just lack the prompt. Take my client, Margaret. She used to have a glass of wine most nights, believing it helped her sleep better. Once she started wearing a sleep tracker though, she saw that her sleep quality was much poorer the nights she imbibed. Once she received this prompt—her sleep score—she adjusted her behavior. When you highlight important data, the right choices become clearer. When it comes to changing behaviours, sometimes all it takes is one key piece of data. As they say, “Once you see it, you can’t un-see it.” (PN’s CEO Tim Jones used the feedback he got from various lifestyle trackers to finally reduce his genetically high cholesterol levels—and built a richer, more meaningful life in the process. Read more: How This Guy Cut His Cholesterol in Half Without Drugs ) When Jan, an avid recreational cyclist, found out he could view—then demolish—the records set on local biking trails, he set to work. But as those records were destroyed, so too was his ability to ride for enjoyment. His focus on speed left him under-recovered and eventually led to burnout. If workouts have become more about the numbers and less about technique, experience, or even enjoyment, tracking is likely no longer helpful. The harder you work, the better your results. Right? Not necessarily. This belief tends to get grinders like Zak into trouble because they think they’re making progress—but really they’re just getting in their own way, even inhibiting performance and recovery. Meanwhile, there are also many people who chronically under estimate their effort and capacity, and would benefit from turning up the heat. Here, data can help us more accurately understand our own potential. Let’s look at high-intensity interval training (HIIT) as an example. HIIT workouts alternate fixed periods of intense effort with fixed periods of rest. However, these fixed periods of rest are just estimates of recovery times. Heart rate data can create a more individualized picture of actual recovery needs, which may be faster or slower than you expect. Sometimes, the mind says yes but the heart says not quite yet. A good coach does more than just simply ask for more . They also help keep clients out of the unproductive “junk volume” zone, where fatigue accumulates but performance doesn’t improve (and maybe even worsens). By looking at real-time metrics of output, fatigue, and recovery, you can better understand yourself and your clients, and help keep everyone training and recovering efficiently. When you become overly reliant on data, you risk losing touch with your own sense of how you feel, whether that’s hunger and fullness levels, energy and fatigue, or something else. A relevant example is “The Great My Fitness Pal Blackout.” In January of 2019, the calorie-tracking app (with a reported 200 million subscribers!) went down for a day. Pretty minor—unless you happened to be tracking your macro and caloric intake and waiting for the app to tell you exactly how much you could eat that day… which I was. When the app wouldn’t load, I recognized the mild panic I felt was unhelpful. My overreliance on the app had disconnected me from my own internal signals, and without it, I felt adrift. Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to how energetic I feel and one of the oldest tracking technologies available: the mirror. (If you feel like you’re lost without your besties—your phone and your apps—there’s a name for that. There are also ways to develop a healthier relationship with your tech. Read more: What is nomophobia? ) Before we get to how to do the above, let’s talk about why assessing things by feel can be so important. Whether it’s body fat percentage or movement speed, even supremely motivated and capable clients will experience diminishing objective results from their training. The scale stops dropping, the number of plates you’re able to load on the bar plateaus, or— gasp —your race time even regresses. Motivation based purely on progress or other extrinsic goals 6 will fall away during these times. However, exercisers who focus on feelings of mindfulness 7 , mastery, meaning 8 , and success 9 develop a more resilient practice. They also enjoy the process more, whether that’s the process of running, lifting, winding down for a good night’s sleep, or just enjoying a meal. So, although objective data can provide essential feedback and guidance, you’ll only reap the full benefits of your practice—that is, enjoyment and results—if you maintain connection with your felt experience. And good news: You can actually use fitness trackers to calibrate and even improve your ability to accurately sense what’s happening in your body. Here are three ways to do it. Can you imagine asking someone how their vacation was and then waiting for them to look at their photos to be able to answer? That’s what it’s like when you rely purely on external data about your own experience. Whatever the metric—how far you biked, how many calories you consumed, or how fast your heart was beating—the simplest way to work mindfully with tracker data is to pause, breathe, and then tune into the powerful (if not always accurate) prediction-making powers of your brain. Once you’ve checked in with yourself, you can calibrate your self-assessment by comparing the detailed (if not always accurate) outputs of your fitness tracker. Over time, you may be able to narrow the gap between two. (Note: Don’t forget to regularly update your app. Algorithms and data sets are regularly adjusted for better predictive accuracy.) The coaches I work with regularly ask people to estimate the boundaries of their strength (such as how many reps they can do at a given weight until failure). Novices are often terrible at estimating this—and regularly off the mark by five or more reps. However, the use of objective trackers can help calibrate their understanding, and most people can reduce their margin of error dramatically. In theory, you might use fancy tools like accelerometers or blood lactate measurements, but our coaches just ask, “For a million dollars a rep, how many more reps do you think you could do?” Though there’s nothing objective about this question, most clients are able to use the prompt as a kind of shortcut to understand maximal effort. (After all, that last rep may be worth seven figures!) The question also leverages the rate of perceived exertion (RPE)—your perception of how hard you’re working—which is one of the most validated sensory-driven approaches. Not everyone is automatically good at estimating RPE, but most people can improve their skills by mapping their felt experience with occasional calibration with objective data. Trackers have components like accelerometers, GPS, and gyroscopes to sense data about speed, distance, and more. But humans are no slouches either. We have… And that’s only a partial list. You have access to an incredibly rich network of sensory information—something that technology cannot begin to touch. All of this information is fed into the powerful pattern-recognition machine of your nervous system. To continue honing your ability to use this rich network of sensory information, regularly check in with what and how you’re feeling. When you learn to calibrate your own senses with objective data, you can leverage all the cool advances in wearable tech—while still keeping your own experience front and centre.

Here are four steps to freedom.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com/how-to-stop-tracking-macros\">How to stop tracking macros and trust yourself around food</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.precisionnutrition.com\">Precision Nutrition</a>.</p>\n\nShare After years of careful macro tracking, Dr. Fundaro finally admitted to herself that the method no longer worked for her. Yet she was afraid to give it up. If anyone should feel confident in their food choices, it would be Dr. Gabrielle Fundaro. After all, Dr. Fundaro has a PhD in Human Nutrition, a decade-plus of nutrition coaching experience, and six powerlifting competitions under her belt. Yet, when she was really honest with herself, Dr. Fundaro realized that she felt far from confident around food. For years, she’d used macro counting as a way to stay “on track” with her eating. And it worked… until it didn’t. After years of macro tracking, Dr. Fundaro was tired of the whole thing. She was tired of making sure her macros were perfectly in balance. She was sick of not being able to just pick whatever she wanted off a menu and enjoy the meal, trusting that her health and physique wouldn’t go sideways as a result. Yet the idea of not tracking freaked her out. Every time she quit tracking, she worried: “What if I don’t eat enough protein, and lose all my muscle?” “What if I overeat and gain fat?” “What if I have no idea how to fuel myself without tracking macros? And what does that say about me as an expert in the field of nutrition?” Something that would support her nutritional goals while also giving her a sense of freedom and peace around food. Calorie counting wouldn’t do it. That was just as restrictive as counting macros—maybe more. Intuitive eating didn’t seem like a good fit either. Intuitive eating relies heavily on a person’s ability to tune into internal hunger and fullness cues to guide food choices and amounts. After years of relying on external cues (like her macro targets), Dr. Fundaro didn’t feel trusting enough of her own instincts; she wanted more structure. Meanwhile, at the gym, Dr. Fundaro began lifting based on the Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale—a framework that helps individuals quantify the amount of effort they’re putting into a given movement or activity. It’s considered a valuable tool to help people train safely and effectively according to their ability and goals. (More on that soon.) While using the RPE scale in her training, Dr. Fundaro found she was both getting stronger and recovering better. There was something to this combination of structure and intuition that just worked. And then, it dawned on Dr. Fundaro like the apple hit Sir Isaac Newton on the head: With that, the RPE-Eating Scale was born. Dr. Fundaro has since used this alternative method to help herself and her clients regain confidence and self-trust around food; improve nutritional awareness and competence; and free themselves from food tracking . (Yup, Dr. Fundaro finally trusts her eating choices—no macro tracker in sight.) In this article, you’ll learn how she did it, plus : Invented by Gunnar Borg in the 1960’s, Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) is a scale that’s used to measure an individual’s perceived level of effort or exertion during exercise. Though Borg’s RPE uses a scale that goes from 6 to 20, many modern scales use a 0 to 10 range (which is the range that Dr. Fundaro adapted for her RPE-Eating scale). Here’s the RPE scale used in fitness. Originally used in physiotherapy settings, the scale is now frequently used in fitness training. For example, powerlifters might use it to choose how heavy they want to go during a training session. Or, pregnant women might use it to ensure they aren’t over-exerting themselves during a fitness class or strength training session. Because human experience is highly subjective and individual, the scale allows the exerciser to judge how hard they’re working for themselves. A coach can provide a general guideline, such as “aim for a 7/10 this set,” but it’s up to the client to determine exactly what that means for them. Dr. Fundaro had used the scale many times with herself, and clients. She always appreciated the sense of autonomy it gave her clients, while still providing some structure. So, she decided to take the same 1-10 scale and its principles, and apply it to eating.  The goal with RPE-Eating is similar to RPE when training: Develop the skills to determine what is sufficient for you , without having to rely on other external metrics (such as apps or trackers). If you’ve ever practiced RPE-training, you’ll know it takes some time to get used to. RPE-Eating is the same. Don’t expect to be in lockstep with all of your body’s internal cues at first, especially if you’ve been ignoring them for a long time. With this in mind, apply the steps below to practice the RPE-Eating process. RPE-Eating is not just another diet. “It’s not about aiming to change your body,” Dr. Fundaro explains. “It’s not about feeling more control over your diet. Nor is it about feeling like you’re eating the ‘optimal’ diet.” If your priority is maintaining a specific physique (such as staying ultra lean) or changing your body (building muscle or losing fat), this method can be adapted for that, though it isn’t the most efficient one to use. Instead, RPE-Eating is about sensing into what your body needs and giving yourself appropriate nourishment—while building inner trust and confidence along the way. “You have to trust that you’ll be able to nourish your body, and that you’ll be okay even though things may change in your body,” says Dr. Fundaro. Admittedly, this can be challenging to do. It can also be difficult to let go of the expectation that you’ll hit the “right” macros at every meal—which RPE-Eating isn’t specifically designed to do. However, if your goal is to build more self-trust, RPE-Eating can be a great tool to help you do that. Before we explore this step, let’s distinguish between two motivators for eating. First, there’s hunger . Hunger occurs when physical cues in your body (like a general sense of emptiness or rumbling in your stomach, or lightheadedness) tells you that you require energy—known to us mortals as food. Then, there’s appetite. Appetite is our desire or interest in eating. It can stay peaked even after hunger is quelled, especially if something looks or tastes especially delicious—like a warm, gooey cookie offered after dinner that you feel you have to try, even though you’re technically full. While it’s normal to eat for both hunger and appetite drives, the two can become mixed up. Especially if we have a history of dieting and tracking food. The RPE-Eating scale helps you tap back into those true physical hunger cues, and learn the difference between hunger and appetite. To put this in practice, try this before your next meal: ▶ Using the RPE-Eating scale mentioned above , identify your current level of hunger. Record the number on paper or the notes app on your phone. ▶ Then, eat your meal with as much presence as possible. (Note: This in itself takes practice. It can help to limit distractions, such as eating at the table rather than in front of the TV, and focusing on the flavors and textures of the food you’re eating, and how you feel eating it.) ▶ About halfway through the meal, check in again. Based on the scale, how hungry are you now? As before, record the number. ▶ If you’re still hungry, finish your meal. When you’re finished, repeat the same process, writing down where you are on the scale. ▶ Once you’re done, take a minute and tune into what your body feels like. What does it feel like to be full? “Download” that feeling into your mind and internalize it in your body, as if you’re updating your phone with the latest software. Repeat this for as many meals as you can. Aim to do it for one meal a day for a week or so, or for as long as feels good to you. Don’t worry if you forget: simply repeat the practice when you can. The more you practice this, the better you’ll become at being attuned with your actual hunger cues. With time, you’ll likely find you develop more trust in your internal compass than what the latest diet tracker says for your needs. (For more on fully-tuned-in, mindful eating, read: The benefits of slow eating .) Have you ever come home after a super stressful day and you’ve basically thrown yourself onto a bag of chips or a carton of ice cream? We might like to imagine ourselves eating every meal mindfully, using the RPE- Eating system to a tee, but life rarely works like that. Chances are, there are certain situations that trigger you to eat more quickly, mindlessly, and beyond the point of hunger. That’s okay. Dr. Fundaro’s suggestion? Aim to become more aware of the situations that cause you to overeat in the first place. To do this, you can practice something we use in PN Coaching: Notice and name. When you find yourself scarfing down food faster than you can blink, simply try to notice what’s going on. Can you name a feeling—such as anxiety, or sadness? Can you identify a situation or moment that happened before you started eating—say, an argument with your teenager, or a nasty email from your boss? Once you’ve identified the feeling, event, or person that’s triggered you to eat compulsively, see if you can also identify what you might really be needing or desiring. Eating for comfort is normal. However, if it’s the only coping method we have, it can cause more problems than it solves in the long run. When you find yourself with an urge to eat mindlessly, consider what non-food coping mechanisms might help you feel better. That could be 10 minutes away from your computer to close your eyes and breathe, a walk outside, or a quick call to a friend to rant—or just talk about something completely unrelated. Getting to know your non-hunger eating triggers—plus widening your repertoire of self-soothing methods—is just as valuable as getting to know your hunger cues. Over time, this awareness will allow you to eat with more intention. Even when you’re “adequately fueled” from a physical perspective, you might still feel unsatisfied from an emotional perspective. That’s because, according to the RPE-Eating framework, eating should fulfill two criteria: ▶ Satiety describes the physical sensation of being full; your calorie or fuel needs are met. ▶ Satisfaction describes a more holistic feeling of being nourished; your calorie needs are met, but your meal also felt pleasurable . If you ate to satiety only, your calorie needs might be met and your physical hunger quelled, but you might still feel unsatisfied—maybe because chocolate is on your “don’t” list, and even though you’ve eaten everything else in your kitchen that isn’t chocolate, nothing quite “hit the spot.” In other words, you can eat to satiety at every meal, yet still be “restricting” foods. You may not be restricting calories per se, but you may have banned entire food groups—baked goods, pizza, or whatever else curls your toes. This can lead to a feeling of constantly needing to police yourself, and doesn’t leave much room for the flexibility and spontaneity that real-life (enjoyable) eating requires. (Plus, avoiding particular foods tends to work like a pendulum: restrict now; binge later. If you want to learn how to stop those wild swings, read: How to eat junk food: A guide for conflicted humans ) Satisfaction is a key part of eating. After all, humans don’t just eat for adequate nutrients and energy. We eat for other reasons too: pleasure, novelty, tradition, community, enjoyment. So, to take your RPE-Eating to the next level, Dr. Fundaro recommends trying it with meals and foods you genuinely enjoy. If any foods or meals have been “off-limits,” try eating them using the RPE technique. (Macaroni and cheese, anyone?) Practice using the scale with a variety of meals (including those you may have restricted previously), and notice how you feel over time. With experience, you’ll get to know what it feels like to adequately fuel yourself with a variety of foods—including those you genuinely enjoy. RPE-Eating isn’t for everyone, but might be a good fit for you (or your clients) if: ✅ You feel dependent on food tracking, but you don’t want to be. ✅ Every time you stop tracking, the loss of perceived control freaks you out and drives you right back to tracking. ✅ You want to stop tracking, but you want to have some type of system or guidance in place. ✅ You’re currently tracking (or considering tracking) your food intake, and you have elevated risk factors for developing an eating disorder such as high body dissatisfaction; a history of yo-yo dieting; a history of disordered eating patterns; and/or participation in weight class sports. If you’re a coach looking to use this tool with a client, check out Dr. Fundaro’s resources . Remember this tool may not be for everyone, and how you apply it needs to be flexible. Note: If you or your client struggles with disordered eating, this tool does not replace working with a health professional who specializes in eating disorders, such as a therapist, doctor, or registered dietician.  According to Dr. Fundaro, the best way to use RPE-Eating is in a weight-neutral setting. While it could be used for weight modification, she doesn’t recommend treating it as another way to hit your macros or “goal weight.” “I’m not anti -weight modification,” Dr. Fundaro explains. “I’m pro safe weight modification. I compare weight loss to contact sports. There are inherent risks but they can be mitigated through best practices.” Dr. Fundaro elaborates: “Since RPE-Eating removes macro-tracking, which can increase risk of disordered eating in some people, and relies on biofeedback and non-hunger triggers, RPE-Eating provides a safety net that macro-tracking alone doesn’t provide.” But if you do want to use RPE-Eating for intentional weight change, what should you do? Dr. Fundaro recommends aiming to hover around the ranges that support your goal. ( As a reminder , a 1 to 3 on the RPE-Eating scale is categorized as “inadequate fuel; a 4 to 7 is categorized as “adequate fuel”; and a 8 to 10 is categorized as “excess fuel.”) ▶ If the goal is weight gain, you’ll likely aim to eat within the 7 to 8 range for most of your meals. ▶ If the goal is weight loss, you’ll likely aim to eat within the 4 to 5 range for most of your meals. A key thing to remember is that you would never use RPE-Eating for extreme weight-modification such as for a bodybuilding competition. “That would be like using physio exercises to prepare for a powerlifting competition.” In other words, it’s not the right tool for the job. If you’re skeptical and think this is just eating “based on your feelings,” keep in mind that RPE was once laughed at by lifters, too. These days, RPE and autoregulation are widely accepted in gym culture and have been studied as a valid method for managing and guiding your training. 1 RPE isn’t perfect, but it’s pretty accurate and incredibly convenient. A lot more convenient than, say, using a velocity loss tracker for every set. 2 3 And while it might seem like it’s all feelings-based, the RPE scale is actually built around practicing the skill of interoceptive awareness —the awareness of internal sensations in your body. The better you get at the skill of interoceptive awareness, the more you’ll be able to use that awareness to make informed decisions about your training. RPE-Eating is similar: It builds the skill of sensing into your own body, and lets your internal sensations guide your decisions. Similar to how the bar slowing down on a squat would indicate you’re getting closer to failure, experiencing the absence of hunger at the end of your meal would indicate you’re closer to being full. Instead of tracking your glucose levels to validate your perceived hunger, you use internal cues that correlate with lowered blood sugar and coincide with hunger. And, let’s be real: Being mindful of stomach grumbling or general hunger pangs is much more convenient and accessible than tracking glucose readings. This process will not be perfect. You may undereat or overeat at first. But over time, with practice, you’ll build the core skills of RPE-Eating. While this tool can be helpful, it’s just a tool. A screwdriver is great, but it isn’t useful when you need a hammer. RPE-Eating can be great for helping you become more aware of your internal hunger cues and build a better relationship with food along the way. It can also be more laborious. It requires paying real attention to your feelings (physical and emotional), and reflecting on them. This can be difficult for anyone—but especially people who aren’t able to sit at the table and have a leisurely meal, like parents with small kids, or people with work schedules that require eating on-the-go. If this is you, just use RPE-Eating when it does work for you—or simply pick and choose specific steps to use in isolation. For example, maybe you try RPE-Eating on the occasional quiet lunch break. Or, maybe you focus solely on developing your awareness of hunger and fullness cues, without trying to change anything else. Tracking macros isn’t inherently bad. It can actually be a helpful tool to teach you more about nutrition. But it’s also not something most people want to do for the rest of their lives. The problem is, if you’ve depended on tracking your food intake, stopping can feel scary. In these cases, RPE-Eating can be used as a kind of off-ramp to help transition away from rigid and restrictive macro tracking. (It can also help loosen the compulsion to “always finish your plate.” Though macros tracking and habitual plate-cleaning may sound different, they’re actually similar: both rely on external cues—such as macro targets or what’s served on your plate—to determine when you’re “done.”) RPE-Eating won’t take away all the scary feelings that may come with changing ingrained ways of eating. However, it can provide some structure and language to help you, or your clients, eat with less fear, less stress, and a bit more confidence. “The goal,” says Dr. Fundaro, “is to know that you’re nourishing yourself—and you don’t need a food tracker to do that.” Click here to view the information sources referenced in this article. 1.

Him: What restaurant? Me: I can’t think of the name. We’ve eaten there before. It’s that place with the peanut shells on the floor? It’s next to… You know… It’s on that road where we used to take the dog to the vet. Do you know the one I’m talking about?? It was as if certain details got lost in a pile of sludge in the deep recesses of my brain. Then, hours later, the details would escape, and I’d shout into an empty room… “Texas Roadhouse!” However, what seemed to be happening to me, increasingly in my late 40s and early 50s, felt far from typical. Not only could I never seem to spit out the names of various restaurants or people or books or movies or so many other things, but my brain was also pooping out during the workday. I’d sit in front of my computer screen, stare at a document, and will myself to do something constructive with my fingertips. Everything seemed hazy, like those first few moments in the morning when you’re awake enough to turn off the alarm but too sleepy to do basic math. I had my good moments, usually in the morning, when I attempted to pack eight hours of writing into the two or three hours I possessed mental clarity. On my worst days, however, I awoke with a haze I never managed to shake. Work was a non-starter. Nor did I have enough bandwidth to read, or do much of anything, really. Three healthcare professionals recommended antidepressants. I tried one, and felt even worse. I tried another. I tried yet another at a higher dose. Still, I felt like a zombie. Another professional gave me a sleeping pill. It left me feeling even more drugged. Someone tested my thyroid. There was nothing wrong with it. Nor was I anemic. I tried supplements, mushroom coffee, and just about any product with the word “think” somewhere on its label. Finally, after nearly two years of seeing a revolving door of doctors, I made an appointment with a gynecologist for my yearly exam. I mentioned vaginal dryness. That information triggered her to ask a string of questions that had nothing to do with my undercarriage. How was my sleep? Mood? Energy levels? Was I experiencing hot flashes? How about brain fog? “Funny you should mention brain fog,” I said in my usual hazy monotone. “I feel like I’m barely alive.” By the end of the visit, I understood that I’d likely never had depression. My gynecologist sent me home with prescriptions for estradiol and progesterone. Within days, it was as if someone had flipped a switch. I could think again. I could type words again. I could follow conversations. I could work past noon. And, for the first time in years, I could sleep more than two hours without waking. Help people improve their health and fitness—while making a great full-time or part-time living doing what you love. Nor is it a disease. Instead, like puberty, it’s a life stage—a transitional moment to be precise. Once you’ve gone 12 consecutive months without a period, you’ve reached menopause. And from that moment onwards, you’re officially “postmenopausal.” As women approach this transitional moment, hormone levels fluctuate and fall, triggering dozens of symptoms. Weight gain and reduced sex drive get a lot of attention. However, during and after menopause, roughly 40 percent of women report increased irritability, mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, and trouble concentrating, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 1 2 As the following image shows, it’s also one of the most vulnerable times in a woman’s life to develop depression, 3 particularly if they’ve struggled in the past with it before.  Before starting hormones, I often found myself sobbing for no reason. Other times, the world’s stimuli felt too… stimulating. Normal everyday sounds—like the buzz of traffic or people at the mall—literally hurt . I was jumpy and irritable and felt anxious about situations that had never bothered me in the past, such as driving over bridges or through construction. Fluctuating hormone levels likely play a role, as do typical age-related changes in the brain. In addition, during this stage of life, women often deal with several issues that siphon cognitive capacity faster than a thirsty vampire drains a carotid. During their 40s and 50s, for example, many women have reached the peak of their careers, with responsibilities that follow them home and keep them up at night. They may also be parenting angst-filled teens, caring for aging parents, adjusting to an empty nest, questioning their marriage, or trying to wrap their bank account around the latest statement from the college bursar or hospital billing department. However, one of the lesser-known and talked about triggers for cognitive discontent has nothing to do with aging or life stress and everything to do with that hallmark menopausal symptom: the hot flash. Hot flashes, which happen during the day, and night sweats, which occur at night, fall under the category of vasomotor symptoms . (The word “vasomotor” refers to the constriction or dilation of blood vessels which, in turn, can influence everything from blood pressure to sweating.) During a hot flash or night sweat, norepinephrine and cortisol levels rise. Blood vessels dilate in an attempt to shed heat. Blood pressure and heart rate increase. Depending on the severity of the hot flash, your skin might redden as sensations of warmth spread through your face, neck, and chest. You might sweat, experience heart palpitations, or feel anxious, tired, or faint. 4 It’s not entirely clear why hot flashes crop up around menopause. According to one theory, falling estrogen levels affect the hypothalamus , the area of the brain involved in temperature regulation. The brain’s internal thermostat gets wonky and occasionally thinks your body is too hot or cold (when it’s not). For many years, experts thought of vasomotor symptoms as mere inconveniences or sources of embarrassment. (To be honest, so did I. During all of those fruitless visits to various healthcare professionals, it never occurred to me to mention them.) However, an increasing body of research has revealed that hot flashes may do more than make us uncomfortable or force us to change our sheets in the middle of the night. They may also affect our blood vessels and brains—and not for the better. 5 For this reason, an increasing number of experts now consider vasomotor symptoms to be a treatable medical condition. 6 7 8 In one study, researchers asked 226 women to wear monitors that tracked when they were experiencing a hot flash. The women also underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), filled out sleep diaries, and wore smartwatches that recorded how often they woke at night. 9 As researchers looked at the brain images obtained from women who experienced the most hot flashes, they noticed an abundance of patchy areas called whole-brain white matter intensities. These lesions were once thought of as a typical consequence of aging. However, neuroscientists now believe that the presence of whole-brain white matter intensities is predictive of future cognitive decline. People with an abundance of these brain lesions are twice as likely to get diagnosed with dementia and three times as likely to have a future stroke. 10 It’s thought that the increased presence of whole-brain white matter intensities may stem, in part, from changes taking place in the blood vessels that feed the brain. A three-year study of 492 women supports that theory. It determined that women who experienced frequent hot flashes also tended to experience unhealthy changes in their blood vessels , such as an inability to dilate to accommodate increased blood flow. 11 Other research has linked frequent hot flashes with increases in the following: In addition to directly affecting the blood vessels, frequent hot flashes may also affect the brain by disturbing sleep. 17 Interestingly, many women don’t necessarily know that hot flashes are disturbing their sleep. They may instead—as I did—assume they have insomnia or sleep apnea. That’s because night sweats aren’t always sweaty. By the time a surge in cortisol and norepinephrine jolts a woman awake, the hotness of the flash may have dissipated. So, it can feel as if she’s repeatedly waking, over and over and over again, for no discernable reason. These frequent awakenings may interfere with the brain’s ability to consolidate memories, metabolize toxins, and store all the names, dates, and facts one encounters daily. It can also lead to lost connectivity in the hippocampus , a part of the brain that’s important for learning and memory. Sleep loss also means the amygdala , a part of the brain involved in emotion, becomes more reactive, causing people to feel more easily stressed, anxious, irritable, frustrated, or enraged. 18 19 All of these brain changes can set in after just days to a week of lost sleep. So, imagine what happens when you’ve been waking over and over again—for years. To diagnose depression, healthcare professionals use a tool called the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scale. If you check off four of the nine symptoms on the scale, you’re considered depressed. However, four of the symptoms on the checklist also overlap with the symptoms of menopause-related sleep deprivation: Check off those four items, and you might be diagnosed with depression, even if what’s really ailing you is the battle with sleep you’ve been waging since you turned 47. Another problem: On surveys, 80 percent of medical residents admit they feel “barely comfortable” talking about menopause. 20 In addition, few residency programs—including ob-gyn residency programs—offer training in it. 21 Given the above, it’s no wonder so many healthcare professionals never think to ask about hot flashes or sleep disturbances when people like me show up complaining of fatigue, lack of gumption, and an inability to focus. In addition, even when it’s clear that vasomotor symptoms are leading to cognitive and emotional symptoms, many healthcare professionals still shy away from prescribing menopausal hormone therapy (also called hormone replacement therapy, or HRT), often telling women that supplemental hormones are “not safe” or “too risky.” These professionals are practicing what Michigan-based menopause-trained gynecologist Jerrold H. Weinberg, MD, calls “defensive medicine.” “It’s one of the first reflexes doctors have when they recommend a treatment,” says Dr. Weinberg. “They worry they’re going to get sued.” These worries are based on research done several decades ago that linked the use of certain types of hormones with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer or stroke. 22 However, according to more recent research, that small increased risk seems to depend on several other factors, such as age, dose, the type of hormonal preparation, and the duration of hormone use. 23 24 As long as you’re younger than 60 and have been postmenopausal for fewer than 10 years, many experts now say the benefits outweigh the risks for women with moderate to severe menopausal symptoms. 25 It’s also counterbalanced by health benefits such as reduced risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or osteoporosis, says Dr. Weinberg, who confirms the health benefits of menopause hormone therapy far outweigh the risks for most women. Because some antidepressants can lift mood, improve sleep, and reduce hot flashes, some healthcare professionals turn to them instead of menopause hormone therapy. As with any medicine, antidepressants have their own list of side effects. However, for someone practicing defensive medicine, they often seem like a safer bet, says Dr. Weinberg. 26 27 28 If you or your client are on what seems like a never-ending quest to find a healthcare professional who understands menopause, use the following advice from Dr. Weinberg and Helen Kollias, PhD, an expert on physiology and molecular biology and science advisor at Precision Nutrition and Girls Gone Strong. ▶ Seek care from a menopause-trained health professional . Usually, these professionals list this training and interest in their bio. For example, they might list “menopause” as an area of focus. You can also search this database for practitioners who have earned a certification from the Menopause Society. ▶ Document your symptoms . Write them down. That way, if you feel foggy or nervous during your appointment, you can lean on your notes. This information can also help you judge whether MHT or another medicine is working. Based on your symptom data, you and your healthcare professional may decide to switch to a different medicine or change your dose. Consider tracking: ▶ Be as specific as you can during your appointment. Saying something like “I don’t sleep well,” is less likely to get you the right kind of help than saying, “During the past seven days, I’ve only gotten four uninterrupted hours once. I wake, on average, five times a night. On a typical night, my longest stretch of sleep is three hours.” If you use a smartwatch, come ready to fire up your health app, so your healthcare professional can see the data. ▶ Talk about the pros and cons of treatment . There’s a concept in medicine known as “shared decision-making.” Part of that process involves frank discussions about the benefits and risks of a given treatment. Then, patients and clinicians work together to make decisions based on those benefits and risks. Many healthcare networks encourage clinicians to use shared decision-making, as it seems to reduce patient complaints as well as malpractice lawsuits. 29 30 For this reason, shared decision-making can help shift a healthcare professional out of the “defensive medicine” mindset. You might ask questions like: The lifestyle habits that improve mental and emotional health during menopause aren’t terribly different from the lifestyle habits that improve overall health—for any person, at any stage of life. Other than avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and spicy or hot foods, there’s no special diet for people with vasomotor symptoms. (And by the way, tofu and other soy products don’t seem to help with vasomotor symptoms as much as once thought 30 —though they’re still nutritious.) Healthy behaviors don’t necessarily change during middle age. Nutrition, physical activity, stress management, sleep, social connectedness, and a sense of purpose matter just as much during the menopausal transition as they do when we’re younger. However, these fundamentals are even more important to dial in as life progresses. So consider: If you answered “no” to some or all of those questions, consider why that is. What’s stopping you? How might you remove barriers or shore up support to make those fundamentals easier? In addition to helping to blunt age- and hormone-related losses in muscle and bone mass, creatine may also help bolster mood and brain function while reducing mental fatigue. It also seems to counter some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation. 32 33 Research shows a daily dose of 5 to 7 grams of creatine monohydrate is effective. In addition to helping you feel alert, sunlight helps to set the internal clock in your brain that makes you sleepy at night and spunky in the morning. Morning and late afternoon light exposure seem particularly potent. In a study of 103 people, exposure to morning sunlight predicted better sleep quality the following night. When people spent time outdoors in the mornings, they fell asleep more quickly, slept longer, and experienced fewer awakenings the following evening. 34 Sunlight may also improve mood and concentration. 35 If you’re already worn out, long, intense exercise sessions will likely make you feel worse. For one, injuries crop up much more easily at middle age than during our 20s and 30s. In addition, it takes longer to recover between sessions. 36 String too many overly zealous workouts too close together, and you’ll not only likely start to feel achy but also more irritable, tense, and tired. However, much like a cold shower, short bursts of exercise may help you to feel alert during the day. If you’re falling asleep at your desk, encourage yourself to take short movement breaks such as a 5- or 10-minute walk outdoors or a quick set of pushups or squats. In addition, you may find gentle exercise—such as yoga or stretching—helps you relax before bed. Just don’t make it too intense, or you’ll trigger a release of adrenaline. Whenever you exercise, tune into how your body feels, especially after a particularly bad night of sleep. We’re not saying you should never exercise vigorously or try to beat your lifting PRs. However, depending on your sleep and recovery, you might want to pare things back, especially if you’ve traditionally hit the gym hard. You can still do intense sessions—just balance them out with more moderate sessions, as well as proportionate recovery. Depending on how you feel, you might decide to go all out, as usual. However, you might also decide to do a zone 2 training session instead of an intense run. Or, if you’re resistance training, you might still do your planned session, but reduce the number of sets, reps, or volume lifted. This research-based therapy for insomnia can help you develop skills and mental reframes that encourage sound sleep. For example, a CBT-I therapist will help you develop the skill of getting up at the same time every day, regardless of how badly you slept (or didn’t sleep) the night before. (Read more: Three CBT-I skills that can transform how you sleep .) You may not have the energy (or desire) to do everything you did when you were younger. (When you were 36, your daily checklist defied time and space.) As a result, you might benefit from looking critically at your current responsibilities to see which ones you can shrink or downsize. For several days, track how you spend your time and bandwidth. Then, analyze your data. Ask yourself: If you’re a coach, use the Wheel of Stress Assessment to help clients identify different dimensions of their life that might be draining their mental and emotional capacity. (When you know specifically where your stress is coming from, you have a better chance of resolving it.) If it’s demands from other people that prevent you from prioritizing self-care and recovery, you might like to read: How saying “no” can seriously change your life . You might find you sleep better and experience fewer night sweats if you sleep in a cooler environment. Try turning down the thermostat a couple of degrees, using a fan, or investing in an electric cooling mattress pad. When you feel the fog take over your brain, it’s not likely you’ll be doing “your best work” anyway. So, for a block of time—say, 20 minutes—permit yourself to do nothing. You might: If you need a quick “refresh,” you can also try a 5-minute mind-body scan. Get your body into a comfortable position. For example, you might use the yoga “legs up the wall” pose or lie down and place a pillow under your knees. Then, close your eyes and bring your attention to physical sensations in your body. Start at your head, and work your way down to your toes. Don’t judge or rush to change anything. Just observe, like a scientist. You can also scan your mind, for example, by noticing thoughts. When you’ve completed the scan, consider: You don’t have to “do” anything with the information you uncover, just notice. The foods that protect the blood vessels around your heart can also protect the blood vessels in your brain. For example, both the MIND and Mediterranean diets are associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer’s disease and depression. 37 38 These eating patterns are rich in vegetables, fruit, whole grains, olives, beans, fish, and other minimally-processed whole foods. In addition, nitrate-rich foods like beets and dark, leafy greens may help to dilate blood vessels, temporarily improving memory by helping more blood to reach the brain. 39 40 (For more on how our diet can support brain function and emotional regulation, read: Nutrition and mental health: What (and how) to eat ) It’s frustrating when you feel like you can’t do it all. Believe me. I know. However, this stage of life presents a hidden opportunity, forcing you to re-evaluate what’s most important. Before going on hormones, as my ability to type coherent words and phrases diminished, I was forced to ask an important question: Do I really need to be doing this? It was more of an existential question than a career-related one, and it allowed me to reassess how I wanted to spend my limited mental resources. Given that I was self-employed, I didn’t actually need to be working eight hours a day. That was a gift, wasn’t it? Maybe I also didn’t need to cook dinner six nights out of seven. Maybe the recipes I chose could be simplified, too. Finally, maybe saying “no” a lot more often and without regret would allow me to continue to say yes to the things that mattered most. Things like visiting my aging parents. And picking up the phone whenever my kid called from college. Or meeting a friend for a meandering walk around town. Thanks to the hormones and life tweaks, I now have energy again. I’m also clear-headed most of the time. However, I still tend to end my work day around 3 p.m. Why? Because I can, and I want to.

And the above quote has become one of her taglines. Though Coach Kate has coached thousands of “regular” clients, her specialty is coaching other coaches. Through her work as an instructor with PN’s Level 2 Master Health Coaching Certification , a facilitator for PN’s private online coaching communities, and a coach in her own private practice, she gets a front-row view of all the questions and challenges both new and seasoned coaches have. Coach Kate knows what other coaches are up to. She’s seen the victories and the blunders of thousands of coaches, and today, she’ll share three common mistakes she sees them making. If there’s anything Coach Kate wants, it’s to see her peers achieve wild success, so her hope with this article is to help coaches: We’ll cover three common coaching mistakes, plus the solutions to overcome them. Let’s get into it. Coach Kate describes a coaching business as a three-legged stool. “The vast majority of folks who get into coaching start with the coaching leg,” says Kate. “They want to become the best coach they can be, which is amazing. However, to become the best coach you can be, information and theory only get you so far.” As Kate says, “You cannot become the best coach you can be in a vacuum, talking to yourself in your office.” Which is why she suggests challenging the desire many coaches have to wait until their knowledge is “complete.” Instead, she suggests, just start selling. Why? Coaches who start selling sooner also get to start coaching sooner. Over time, they’ll have an advantage over the coaches who want to be “the BEST coach they can be” by getting 12 certifications before selling their services. Meanwhile, the coach who “doesn’t really know what they’re doing” but has started practicing anyway will begin building their business and their coaching experience—and likely improve their odds of overall success. There’s a natural inclination among aspiring coaches who want to do a good job to get those 12 certifications before they start coaching. “Sometimes we hold on to this hope that we’ll get to a point where we feel confident enough at fielding any question that ever comes our way,” Kate says. Because as every coach knows, when you start telling people what you do, they’ll have questions. And often, they’ll have questions you can’t answer, and that can feel uncomfortable… mortifying even. (You’re supposed to be the expert , right??) According to Coach Kate, the above belief—that you’re supposed to be an authority with all the answers—is based on an erroneous assumption. “When I show up to a coaching conversation, my role is not ‘the expert,’” she says. Yes, coaches have to show up to client interactions with a baseline of nutrition knowledge. (For example, if a client asks you about good sources of protein, you should be able to list some.) But coaches don’t have to show up with a prepared lecture, or encyclopedic knowledge of nutrition minutia or biochemistry. (You don’t have to feel bad if you can’t recall the ratio of omega 3 to omega 6 in flax oil, or all the steps in the Krebs cycle that produces ATP.) Even when you know the answer, Kate suggests that not answering right away can actually be more productive. “If a client asks you about seed oils, you can simply say, ‘That’s a great question. I can get you some information on that if you’d like, but I’m curious, why do you ask?’” While the expert might respond with a summary of the latest research on seed oil processing and its health effects, the coach will strive to learn more about why the question is meaningful to the client. For example, after inquiring further, you may learn that your client heard about seed oils from their friend Susan, who changed the fat sources in her diet and lost ten pounds. And the client is curious to see if they might also lose ten pounds if they eliminate seed oils. With this kind of response, you learn more about what the client is really after (a weight loss solution), which ultimately helps direct you to more effective strategies (which probably have nothing to do with seed oils). ▶ Takeaway nugget: Coaches should have a firm understanding of fitness and nutrition principles. However, clients often don’t need more information; they need coaching . When a client asks you a question, consider whether the answer will help them take action. If it will, offer them what you know. (If you don’t know the answer, you can simply say, “I’m happy to find more information about that for you.”) If it won’t, consider turning their question into a coaching opportunity. Ask, “Can you tell me why you’re curious about that?” Their answers will likely lead you to a more productive conversation. Now, maybe it sounds obvious that clients aren’t just clones of us. That said, especially when we feel all warm and vibe-y with our clients, it can be easy to forget in the moment. For example, maybe you’re someone who… If you’re a coach, you probably went into this line of work because you value nutrition, exercise, and overall health. And often, we assume our clients hold these same values. But the truth is, that’s not always the case. Says Kate: “There’s nothing inherently superior about valuing your health. If you do, yes, you’ll probably experience better health and live longer. But not everyone shares those values. That’s a tough one to swallow.” Of course, without seeing your clients for the unique people they are—with their own individual preferences, values, and goals—you may find yourself suggesting behaviors that aren’t possible for them, or striving for goals that aren’t meaningful to them. Over time, this becomes frustrating for your clients and you: They feel like you don’t “get” them, and you feel like a “bad” coach. The opposite of assuming (often unconsciously) that clients are like you is, well, assuming nothing. As best as you can, check your biases and assumptions at the door, and approach each client session with an open, curious mind. Ask questions, such as: “What inspired you—or pushed you—to come in today?” And: “Why is that goal meaningful to you?” And: “What skills do you have today that might help you achieve your goal? What skills do you feel you might be missing?” Listen. Withholding assumptions can be particularly difficult when clients share some obvious similarities with you. (Perhaps they’re also a single mom, or they’re also training for a triathlon, or they’re also a cancer survivor.) But even when clients share similar experiences or goals, their biology, social context, personal history, and many other factors can make their “similar” experiences, in fact, totally different. Coach Kate says in these cases, you can show that you relate to them, while also inviting them to describe their own experience. She suggests using the following question: “I know what [ insert shared experience ] has been like for me, but what has [ insert shared experience ] been like for you?” Once you have a clear picture of a client’s values, priorities, and reasons for change, you can assess which actions they’re ready, willing, and able to take. (Again, don’t make assumptions here. Just because you find meal prep quick and easy, doesn’t mean your client will.) If you want to go through this exercise with your client on paper, use our Ready, Willing, and Able Worksheet . ▶ Takeaway nugget: Remember that clients: Get to know your unique client, their specific goals, and what actions they can realistically execute (and maybe even get excited about). This is, actually, very natural. “There’s a reason we go into coaching. It’s because we care and we want to help clients. We want to see them succeed,” says Coach Kate. But caring can be a double-edged sword. “With our clients, we carefully decide on the habits and behaviors that need to occur… And then they walk off and either do the thing or don’t do the thing. That’s brutal.” No matter how sound and foolproof your advice is, how well-thought out your plan, how much you care, ultimately, you have no control over whether a client executes it, and gets results. Naturally, as a coach, you might feel frustrated, even heartbroken when clients don’t do what they say they’ll do, or when they’re not seeing the outcomes they were hoping to see. However, according to Kate, this isn’t something coaches should try to avoid completely. It’s part of the job, and it’s often a sign that your work has meaning to you. (It’s a good thing.) “However, I think there’s a point there where we can start caring more than the client themselves,” she says. And that’s precisely where to draw to the line. At PN, we often say that “care units” are the currency of coaching. Care units are how much time, energy, attention, authenticity, and true “heart” you can bring to helping, serving, and caring about your clients. Your client also has a certain amount of care units. How much time, energy, attention, authenticity, and “heart” can they bring to their own change and growth projects? (Most of the time, not that much. Which is totally normal.) Our advice: Care one care unit less than your client does. How do you do that? One approach… So, how do we maintain an appropriate level of emotional investment—but also help clients stay on track? “This is where I really like to get really clear on what my role is as a coach,” Coach Kate says. “Because if you are very, very clear on what your role is as a coach, then you can sort of go through the list, and check in with yourself: ‘Did I show up? Did I follow up? Did I coach this person to the best of my ability?’” For example, as a coach, it’s reasonable to be responsible for: Meanwhile, the client is responsible for: Ideally, clearly delineating these responsibilities should happen early in the coaching relationship. Some coaches prefer to have an open discussion, while others have actual contracts that outline coach deliverables and client expectations. This early communication can also be a way of vetting coach-client “fit.” “When I’m having that initial conversation with a prospective client, I can ask, ‘What does accountability look like to you?’ If the client replies, ‘Well, I want you to text me every morning and night, and I want you to make sure I’ve done my workout, and also ship groceries to my house,’ then I will be the one to say, ‘I don’t think this is a good fit.’” Coach Kate says this kind of early clarity can also prevent coach-client friction in the future. Clear boundaries and expectations at the outset means clients are less likely to be disappointed if they assumed their coach was going to “take on” more, and coaches are less likely to burn out from shouldering more than they should. It even protects the coach-client relationship in extreme (though not uncommon) situations such as when a client “ghosts” before a paid contract is over. “When somebody doesn’t reply to me, I don’t take it personally. It’s not their job to reply, but it is my job to check in,” Coach Kate says. “If I don’t hear back, I just check in on Monday, and then again on Monday. And again, and again, and again—trying all the contact methods they’ve provided me—until their coaching contract is over. If we get to that point, they’ll get an email from me saying, ‘Hey, I hope everything’s okay. My door is always open. I hope you’re doing well.’” ▶ Takeaway nugget: Make a list—either for your own reference, or to include in a contract that new clients have to sign—of the accountabilities you have as a coach. (Hint: These are usually specific actions , like “Text, email, or phone once a week to check in” or “Host monthly virtual lectures on various nutrition topics for group clients.”) Make sure to have a conversation about expectations and responsibilities with all clients, ideally before beginning to work together, or at least in the first session. It’s maybe not the most “coach-y” way to write an article: Point out a list of your mistakes, then hand you solutions to deal with them. But if you’ve made the above “mistakes,” we want you to hear it from us: We’re proud of you. If you’ve gotten sidetracked by the above, it’s likely because you really care. And that’s never going to be a mistake; it’s a strength. That said, although these “mistakes” are completely normal, and most coaches make them, they can limit your potential as a coach, and as a business. And we want to see you succeed.

Anna’s a highly competent law professional. She’s a critical thinker and she fights in the heavyweight division when it comes to cutting through BS. But the Anna I knew was falling into some painful traps that seemed to be bypassing her inner hawk-like skeptic. She’s wanted to lose around 15lbs for some time now and came to me to share how stuck she was feeling in this goal. She brought up an avenue she was exploring: the new BPA-free tupperware set. “Interesting. What inspired you to focus on that?” I asked. “Well, I’ve been reading about how microplastics in food containers can mess up our hormones and cause weight gain,” she said. I squinted. To backtrack, this is right after she told me how she’d been struggling to be consistent at the gym, had been relying on takeout too often, and had been sacrificing boring old sleep for adrenaline-inducing doom scrolling. So I asked: “What about trying to get more consistent with your workouts, or prepping more homemade meals during the week?” And Anna said: “Yeah, but I’ve tried that a thousand times. If it were that simple, it would have worked already.” Ignored or delayed those hard-but-worthwhile habit changes in favor of some ultra-specific, niche magic bullet that’s supposed to “change everything.” Spent hours of research on the ultimate, most optimal workout instead of devoting those hours to just doing the basic workout you already know how to do. Waited to feel more inspired, motivated, or just less busy . Why do we do this? Buying new gear or a popular supplement feels like making progress. Consuming YouTube videos or articles about stuff you can change feels like you’re doing something. And waiting until the “right time” feels , well, right. Except, nothing actually changes until we take real, consistent action. We’re clever, us humans. And we’ve come up with lots of sneaky ways to avoid the basic, unsexy, difficult actions we need to take that actually drive change. In this article, we’ll explore how to take an honest and compassionate look at why you might be distracting yourself from taking impactful action. You’ll learn: We all know what those basic, fundamental health habits are: ▶ Exercising, ideally 30 minutes a day , putting in moderate-to-vigorous amounts of effort, with a mix of aerobic and resistance training. ▶ Eating mostly nutritious, minimally-processed foods. If 80 percent of your diet comes from whole or minimally-processed foods, you’re doing an excellent job. (Translation: “Perfection” isn’t required; pizza can be part of a healthy diet.) ▶ Eating enough protein to support muscle mass, appetite regulation, and body recomposition goals, if you have them. Aim for about 1.2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (for most people, this adds up to about 4-6 palm-sized portions of lean protein per day). ▶ Prioritizing getting seven to eight hours of quality sleep. You can’t always control how well you sleep, but having some wind-down time before bed can help, as can waking up at the same time every day. ▶ Avoiding or at least reducing excessive consumption of alcohol or drugs, including cigarettes. No fun, we know. But it’s for a good cause. Easily, we could add stuff like prioritizing positive, nurturing social relationships, managing stress, and probably others, but just the above list is uncommonly met. In fact, only six percent of Americans perform all five of the following basic health behaviors: 1 If you’re doing the math, that means close to 94 percent of Americans aren’t doing the basics. Yet, these foundational behaviors also help us achieve a long list of common goals, whether that’s reaching a healthy weight, improving athletic ability, or just living a longer, healthier life. So why do we struggle so much to do them? Here are three common barriers we see among clients (and coaches!), plus potential solutions to overcome them. That push-and-pull feeling you have when you think about making a change? It has a name, and it’s called ambivalence. Ambivalence describes the mix of feelings you have when you contemplate, say, waking up earlier so your mornings are less stressful, or cutting down on TV time. We naturally and normally feel ambivalence about change—“I want this, and at the same time, that.” (For example, wanting to eat healthier, and also wanting to have your favorite treats whenever you want without constraint.) We also naturally and normally feel resistance towards change—“I want this, and at the same time, not.” (For example, wanting to stop using your phone as a mindless distraction, but not wanting to deal with the anxiety you get whenever you’re left with your own thoughts.) These contradictory emotions can seem frustrating, puzzling, or “illogical.” Yet, ambivalence and resistance are fundamental parts of the change process . The higher the stakes of change, the more likely we are to feel a mix of strong and unexpected emotions, pushback, rebellion, angst, and other types of resistance and ambivalence. Rather than signaling that the change is a wrong move, strong ambivalence and resistance tend to signal that this change matters to us. In a sense, it’s good news. It tells us we care.  Maybe you’ve decided you want to be healthier. So you declare that, starting Monday, you’re going to exercise for an hour everyday and “eat clean” at every meal and sleep eight hours every night. (Currently, you don’t have a regular exercise habit, don’t particularly like vegetables, and regularly stay up past midnight.) Now, let’s be honest: You’re asking yourself to change a lot of stuff at once. And the last time you created an elaborate plan for overhauling your life… … Did it work? Probably not. (And that’s okay.) When we feel frustrated or stuck in our current situation, making a plan filled with idealistic dreams can provide us temporary relief. And our brain has several (normal) cognitive biases that prevent us from judging the future accurately. We often think we’ll have more time, energy, attention, and motivation in the future than we really do. 2 3 4 5 There’s a powerful, instantaneous comfort that comes with overloading our future self. (Because after all, we won’t start the plan until Monday.) The problem with this is: Big, complex plans often don’t fit into our already busy, complex lives. We under-estimate how many smaller tasks are hidden in the bigger plans. When we (almost inevitably) are unable to execute these ambitious goals, we blame ourselves, our personality traits, our “willpower” or “discipline,” and build a pitiable story about how we “struggle with consistency.” Or how living this way is “impossible”. Then, sadly, we fulfill that prophecy. This barrier comes from the following common belief: “If getting healthy just took eating, sleeping, and exercising moderately well, then everyone would be healthy.” Because everyone knows they should eat their vegetables, get seven to eight hours of sleep per night, and stay active, right? (We’d agree.) But let’s go back to the previously mentioned statistic: Only 6 percent of Americans are consistently performing the most basic health and fitness behaviors. If we add on slightly more advanced—but still very basic—behaviors like eating five servings of fruits and vegetables every day, optimizing protein intake, and effectively managing stress, that number would shrink significantly. So, the first thing is to believe that these simple behaviors work. Because they do. It’s just that most people (probably close to 99 percent of us) are not doing them all simultaneously and consistently . The second thing is to accept that these simple behaviors are a little bit boring. Because they are. Part of the reason we’re attracted to new diets or “magical” supplements is because we just want something more interesting to try. That’s especially true if we’ve already sort of tried the “eat more vegetables” thing and it didn’t “work” for us in the way we expected. With something new and cutting-edge, there’s also the possibility of a new outcome, a new us. And of course, that’s incredibly appealing. Thing is, most hardcore, “industry secret,” or “cutting edge” tools and strategies are, respectively: unsustainable, inaccessible, or ineffective (or unproven). They’ll take your effort, your time, and often your money, but without giving you a good return on your investment—all the while distracting you from the stuff that actually works. Another lie in the health and fitness industry is that you have to be “perfect” to maintain great health. You know, eat only organic salads and chia seeds, be able to run a marathon, and wake up at 5 am every day to meditate and write in your gratitude journal. The truth is, perfection definitely isn’t required. Depending on how you look at this, this could be a relief to hear, or a disappointment. On the one hand, it’s nice to know that you don’t have to have it “all together” to be healthy—even above-average healthy. On the other hand, many of us pursue better health with the belief that our optimal or even “perfect” self will one day, with the right plan or routine, be attainable. But “perfect” health is an illusion. Humans, even exceptionally healthy ones, get sick, get weird rashes, have digestive problems, need reading glasses, get into slumps, or just otherwise have a series of bad days. None of us are “safe” from those life events, and accepting that can feel a little… vulnerable. It’s much more comfortable to believe that if you just take this powdered algae supplement, or follow this specific morning routine, you’ll be immune to any kind of painful human experience. The irony is, to achieve your realistic “best self,” you probably have to accommodate your “worst self” too. You know, the one who’d rather watch another episode of Love is Blind than work out, or eat a party-size bag of Doritos and call it dinner. Because life happens. Work gets busy. Or your kid goes through a “phase.” Or it’s pie season. Any number of obstacles, distractions, and competing demands make it impossible for perfection to be maintained with any kind of consistency. Which is why we need to let go of the illusion that a “perfect” self exists—the one who always has the energy, will, and option to make the ideal choice—and support what our real self wants and needs. We’ve got four steps below to help you. Now that we know what’s potentially getting in the way of taking productive action, here are four steps to get unstuck. Before you (or a client) start undertaking something you want to change, it’s helpful to understand your deeper motivations first. Do a little investigating by asking questions like: You can also go through one of our favorite motivation-mining exercises, The 5 Whys . When you know why you want to change something, and you’re clear on the consequences of not taking action, you’ll be more likely to feel that deeper, more sustaining push to keep going, even when things get tough. We can do all the things!! Really!! We just can’t do all the things… all at once. Effective change means being able to realistically: What are the essentials in relation to your goal? Regardless of all goals, they likely include a movement practice, a nutrition practice, and/or a recovery practice. If you want some guidance on how to select the most effective action for your goal, check out our Skills, Practices, and Daily Actions Cheat Sheet. Here’s how to use it: ▶ Start with the domain you’re most interested in improving (such as “Nutrition” or “Stress”). ▶ Then, get specific about what skill within that domain you’d like to improve (for example, “Eat well intuitively”), plus the practice that most appeals to you within that skill (say, “Eat to satisfied”). ▶ Lastly, choose a daily action from the list of examples under your chosen practice. (For example, “Record hunger and fullness levels at the start and end of meals.”) Once you choose your action, make it work for you by following step 3, below. “I like to challenge a client to set a pathetic goal. If it’s so pathetic, then obviously you can do it, right?” says Kate Solovieva, PN Super Coach and Director of Community Engagement. Sound inspiring? Maybe not. But if you’ve been struggling with consistency, it’s exactly where to start. Ask yourself: Five minutes of walking? 10 push-ups? One extra portion of veggies? Three conscious deep breaths before every meal? Nothing is too small; it just has to be something. Now you’ve got your floor. Then ask yourself: One-hour of all-out effort at the gym? Two hours of meal prep that will feed you and your family for the next three days? A 45-minute guided meditation? This is your ceiling. Now that you’ve identified your “floor” and your “ceiling,” you’ve defined a flexible range of actions that can adapt to your fluctuating, unpredictable, real life. But applying this range requires a paradigm shift: Your health habits aren’t an “on” or “off” switch; they’re on a dial. When life is sweet and smooth, you can turn your exercise, nutrition, and sleep dials way up—if you want. Bust through your PRs at the gym, eat all the arugula, meditate like a monk. But if life gets nuts, you don’t have to switch off completely. Just turn the dial down a little. The below is a visual representation of how this might work for exercise, but you can apply this same thinking to your nutrition, sleep, stress management, or whatever you’re working on.  The important part: Even if you do your “floor” or “dial level 1” action—even if it’s for days on end—it still “counts.” You still get the gold star. Doing the bare minimum isn’t failing. It’s succeeding, in the context of a real, messy, beautiful life. Health and fitness professionals often forget how different their lives are from their clients. For example, many coaches work at gyms, enjoy being physically active, and hang out with other active people. Exercising regularly is almost easier to do than not do , because, as Coach Kate says, “they’ve built a life that makes that habit seamless.” So if you want to make your health goals more likely, Coach Kate offers this advice: “Build an ecosystem that makes failing nearly impossible.” When they want to make a change, many people assume that good intentions and willpower will be enough to carry them through. (And when they fail, naturally, they blame themselves for being “bad” or “weak.”) We often forget about the context and environment that shapes our behaviors —making certain actions more likely or less likely to occur. A recent review from Nature Reviews Psychology ranked different behavior change strategies and found that access was the number one influencer of people’s behaviors. (People who lived in neighborhoods with affordable grocers close by ate better, just like people who had to drive a long distance to the closest gym were less likely to exercise. 6 ) Not everyone can change neighborhoods, but most people have some degree of control over their more immediate environments, and can leverage this power to shape desired behaviors. One example is the “ kitchen makeover ,” where you make sure foods you want to eat are washed, prepped, and at the front of the fridge, ready to eat on a whim. Meanwhile, foods that don’t support your goals get tossed, or relegated to the highest cupboard. (When you need a stepladder from the basement to reach the cookies, you might find you eat them less.) (If you want to try it out, check out our Kitchen Set-up Assessment worksheet.) Think about the goal you want to achieve, and the behaviors that support it. Then, evaluate how you might make small changes to your environment by: Invest your energy building the ecosystem that nudges you to make desired actions the obvious choice. This requires a little more work on the front end, but the payoff will be greater for less overall work. If you’re a perfectionist, or a former straight-A student, that line hurt to read. (Don’t worry. This C+ won’t result in your parents telling you that they’re disappointed.) But what all of the above barriers and solutions have in common, is that they recognize and work with our inherent imperfection. None of us is perfect, and expecting as much often results in failure (or at best, short bursts of success, followed by a crash). Adopt an attitude of compassion and acceptance towards your human self—who’s most likely trying their hardest—and work with your vulnerabilities, instead of constantly expecting yourself to grit your teeth against them. There will be times you’re getting “A’s” in fitness. That’s awesome. And you also don’t need to aim for C+. Just don’t think of yourself as a failure when you have to dial it down. Living a healthy, meaningful life means constantly striving to do our best—while also allowing for flexibility, mistakes, and bad days (or seasons).

When you’re juggling work, family, and more all at once, cooking might not be your top priority. But with a few easy recipes at your fingertips, meal prep can make life simpler and less stressful. Here’s a roundup of eight easy vegetarian recipes that you can whip up at home. Not only are they plant-based and simple to follow, they taste absolutely delicious. You can tackle vegetarian cooking in no time. With its focus on plant-based proteins, fresh produce, and hearty whole grains—a vegetarian diet provides many health benefits while making nutritious eating feel vibrant, satisfying, and sustainable. People choose to be vegetarian for a host of different reasons—including environmental sustainability, animal welfare, health issues, religion, and more ( 2 ). Today it’s simpler than ever to go meatless with more plant-based staples on shelves, more vegetarian dishes at restaurants, and more trustworthy recipes at your fingertips. If you’re worried about missing nutrients without meat, take a breath—you won’t. “Vegetarians can absolutely get all their nutrient needs met ,” says MyFitnessPal dietitian Katherine Basbaum. The key is building meals around nutrient-dense whole foods like beans, grains, veggies, nuts, and seeds rather than leaning on ultra-processed options that are nutrient-poor and high in sugar and salt.. Vegetarian diets can actually be very beneficial if you eat minimally processed, whole foods ( 1 ). In addition to added fiber, benefits include a range of: Basbaum says these benefits can help lower risk for heart disease and help manage blood sugar, blood pressure, and weight ( 1 ). Vegetarian cooking doesn’t need to be scary or overwhelming. Here’s a few tips to save time, money, and energy: 9 Easy Mediterranean Recipes See something you like?

This chickpea “tuna” salad sandwich mimics the taste and texture of your typical tuna sandwich. Full of chickpeas, celery, and red onion, this dish serves up 18 grams of fiber and 18 grams of protein while being low in saturated fat. All you really need for this dish is a bowl and spoon. Simply mix everything together and sandwich your mixture between two slices of bread for a delicious handheld lunch. You can also spice things up a bit with dijon mustard, lemon juice, relish, dill, or whatever else you like.

This simple soufflé packs in flavor, texture, and lots of protein. The earthy Swiss chard adds a hearty, slightly bitter contrast to the creamy, tangy cottage cheese, while fluffy eggs bind it all together into a light yet satisfying low-carb dish. Although this dish takes a bit of time to bake in the oven, the end product is absolutely worth it. It’s good for meal prep, so cut the soufflé into squares and save for an easily-microwaved breakfast. It also works well as a savory brunch centerpiece or a light dinner paired with a side salad.

She is an incoming junior at Northwestern University studying Journalism, Economics, and Integrated Marketing Communications. Her work has been published in The Daily Northwestern and Spoon University. Expert Reviewed By: Lauren Cuda, RD Lauren Cuda, RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal.

She is passionate about leveraging technology and data to improve nutrition accessibility and enhance patient outcomes through evidence-based practice. You’ve seen it all over social media this summer: seafood boils are one of the hottest food trends online right now . Imagine a covered table with a couple plates on the perimeter and an enormous pile of seafood, corn, potatoes, and sausage in the middle. The food is smothered in a flavorful sauce, and just the sight of the food makes your mouth water. Sounds delicious, right? Seafood boil is often viewed as a special occasion meal—but with a couple of ingredient tweaks, it can actually be a nutrient-rich meal that supports your goals. So, what little tweaks can you make to create a seafood boil a dietitian would approve of? Well, we asked one. Here’s what MyFitnessPal registered dietitian Lauren Cuda has to say about it. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that you eat at least 8 ounces of seafood per week ( 1 ). There’s a host of different seafood options that restaurants and grocery stores offer to go into your seafood boil—but what is considered the best, nutritionally? With its chewy texture and coveted flavor, lobster is a lean protein that is low in saturated fat and high in minerals like calcium and potassium ( 2 ). However, a 100 g serving of lobster (equivalent to one tail) contains 535 mg of sodium ( 2 ), which is about 23% of the daily recommended sodium limit. “It’s best to monitor sodium intake throughout the rest of the day,” says Cuda. Crab is a sweet, slightly buttery, and tender seafood that is another great lean protein source. Its nutritional benefits are very similar to lobster, but crab has slightly fewer calories and less sodium ( 3 ). A 100 g serving of crab provides 17% of the daily recommended sodium intake. While lobster and crab are more popular on America’s coasts, crawfish are a Southern staple, particularly in Louisiana. Crawfish are another lean protein, but have the added benefit of containing high amounts of vitamin B-12 ( 4 ). Crawfish contain a lower sodium content than lobster and crab, so Cuda says they’re a good choice if you’re watching your salt intake. Protein Cold Foam Is All Over Coffee Menus—Here’s How to Make It Yourself Cuda calls clams a nutrient-dense shellfish option. They’re high in protein and vitamin B-12, while staying low in saturated fat and sodium ( 5 ). 100 g of clams, which is about seven clams, contains 14.7 g of protein ( 5 ). Similar to crawfish and clams, mussels contain lots of protein and vitamin B-12 ( 6 ). Their sodium content is moderate, as 100 g of mussels contain 16% of the daily recommended sodium intake ( 6 ). In addition to being high in protein and vitamin B-12, shrimp have the added benefit of containing omega-3 fatty acids ( 7 ). They also have a deliciously chewy texture and sweet taste. Like many of the above seafood options, shrimp have a moderate sodium content, with 100 g (equivalent to 10 small shrimp, 7 jumbo shrimp, or 5 prawns) containing 15% of the recommended daily sodium intake ( 7 ). There are so many great seafood options out there to add into a seafood boil. The type of seafood you pick really depends on your personal preferences, taste, health goals, and the other foods you eat that day. “All of these seafood options can fit into a healthy diet when enjoyed in balanced portions,” Cuda says. There are four common add-ons that people typically put into seafood boils. These add-ons bring additional texture, flavor, and variation to a seafood boil so that it’s not all seafood! Let’s take a look at what add-ons are the healthiest. At seafood boil joints, corn is typically chunked and served on the cob in the same mix as your seafood. “Corn is a great addition,” Cuda says. Corn contains a fair amount of fiber and vitamin C ( 8 ), which help with digestion and immune support, according to Cuda. If you’re looking for some carbohydrates to supplement your protein in seafood, corn may be a good option. Potatoes are the other common produce item found in seafood boils, usually served whole or halved. Cuda calls potatoes a “solid choice,” as they offer fiber and potassium to assist heart health and muscle function ( 9 ). While sausage can be flavorful and tasty, Cuda recommends using it sparingly as it tends to be higher in sodium and fat ( 10 ). Because seafood boils already have a fair amount of sodium in them (both in the seafood and the sauces), you might want to be mindful of your sausage portions and save them for a different meal instead. Who doesn’t love eggs? Hard boiled eggs are a nutritious choice, as they’re packed with protein, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin E ( 11 ). Their more neutral taste can also help offset the saltiness of other seafood boil flavors.  About the Expert Lauren Cuda, RD is a Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Dietetics from Missouri State University and her master’s degree in Nutrition Diagnostics from Cox College. With over 10 years of experience, she specializes in pediatric nutrition, malnutrition, and nutrition support. If you’re cooking your own seafood boil, you obviously need to create a flavorful mix of seasonings to cook your ingredients in. At the same time, it’s important to be mindful of sodium content when choosing a seasoning. Some seasonings and spices that boost flavor without adding too much salt are: These seasonings and spices will penetrate into the seafood to add extra punch. If you’re opting for commercial blends such as Cajun seasoning, Cuda recommends using low-sodium versions when possible. Or, make your own blend so you can control the salt, she says. If you’ve ever had seafood boil before, you probably know that most people will dip their seafood in garlic butter sauce. But is this the most health-conscious choice? “Butter-based sauces are flavorful, but they’re also high in saturated fat and calories,” says Cuda. “While they can be part of a balanced meal, it’s helpful to use them in moderation.” Cuda recommends substituting butter-based sauces with a yogurt-based dip, vinegar-based dip, or an herb-infused olive oil. These sauces will still bring a flavor punch, but with healthier fats or additional protein. Here’s some ways to make these alternative dipping sauces: There are many great options for building a healthy seafood boil order, but what really matters is building a balanced plate and paying attention to sodium intake . Aim to select seafood that naturally has less sodium, limit the added salt in your boil base, and be mindful of the dipping sauce you use. At the end of the day, a seafood boil meal is an experience. Prioritize your own taste preferences and really choose what you will enjoy eating!  The information in this article is provided solely for informational purposes.

Her areas of focus include metabolism, gut health, obesity and weight management. When it comes to tart fillings, choosing between sweet potato and pumpkin is really a win-win because both are highly nutritious. Sweet potatoes, however, offer much more fiber, a little more protein, magnesium and vitamin C than pumpkin ( 1 , 2 ). This easy, quick-to-make tart is ideal for holiday gatherings, where the main feast may leave little room for dessert. Just a small slice, with its creamy filling and gingery crust, is sure to satisfy. Be sure not to skip the yogurt topping (the bits of candied ginger echo the ginger flavor in the crust). You can make the tart and the topping a day ahead and serve chilled or at room temperature. Active time: 15 minutes | Total time: 45 minutes Ingredients Directions Preheat oven to 350°F (180ºC).In a food processor, pulse the gingersnap cookies until finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Press the crumb mixture firmly into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Bake for 8 minutes, or until the crust is set. Remove from the oven and set aside. Rinse and dry the bowl of the food processor. Add the sweet potato, evaporated milk, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Process until smooth. Add the eggs and pulse just until combined; do not overmix. Pour the filling into the warm crust. Return the tart to the oven and bake for about 20 minutes, or until the filling is set. Remove the tart from the oven and let cool slightly. Carefully remove the tart from the pan and transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. To make the topping: In a medium bowl, stir together the yogurt, candied ginger, and honey until well combined.

If you’ve recently been online, you’ve probably heard of or seen the “ fisherman aesthetic ” or “ sardine girl summer ” memes. And if you haven’t, think: vacation in Italy, blocky artwork, soft color palettes, and—of course—tinned fish. Tinned (or canned) fish is a budget-friendly protein that is making an online comeback. With pics of high design tins stuffed with sardines going viral, it’s only natural that people will want to try incorporating tinned fish into their diets. But along with the hype of tinned fish also comes some criticism. Some worry that tinned fish is too high in sodium, preservatives, mercury, and BPA. If you’ve seen both the hype and the anxiety online, you might be wondering if tinned fish is really safe to eat. We’ve got answers. Tinned fish is a shelf stable protein that can provide a host of beneficial nutrients. The most common types of tinned fish include: Tinned fish is full of omega-3 fatty acids . Omega-3s are polyunsaturated fats that your body does not produce enough of on its own, making it an essential nutrient ( 1 ). According to MyFitnessPal dietitian Katherine Basbaum, omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce inflammation and support brain health. Tinned fish is also a good source of protein . 100 g of canned salmon contains 23 g of protein ( 2 ), which is comparable to most other meats. Protein is important for a number of different bodily functions, with its main role being to provide the body’s building blocks ( 3 ). Aside from omega-3s and protein, tinned fish provides useful vitamins and minerals . It is high in calcium, a nutrient that is critical for bone health ( 4 ). Tinned fish also has high potassium, magnesium, vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin D, and more ( 2 ). About the Expert Katherine Basbaum, MS, RD is Food Data Curator at MyFitnessPal. She received her Masters in Nutrition Communication from the Friedman School of Nutrition Science & Policy at Tufts University and completed her Dietetic Internship at UVA Health, where she also works as a nutrition counselor for cardiology patients. While there are many benefits to consuming tinned fish, recent internet discourse has brought up some concerns about how safe the stuff is. Tinned fish may be high in sodium due to canning and preservation techniques. “If you are watching your sodium intake, make sure to look at the ingredients list when shopping for tinned fish since some products will have added sodium while others will not,” Basbaum says. Processed food gets a bad rap in comparison to fresh, whole foods. Oftentimes, processed food is full of preservatives to keep it shelf stable. Yet, tinned fish generally does not need additional preservatives to keep it long-lasting ( 5 ). The high-heat and pressure treatment involved in the canning process keeps tinned fish safe to eat without the need for added preservatives. Almost all fish contain trace amounts of mercury, so it’s not a matter of canned fish having more mercury than fresh fish—it’s about the type of fish you eat. According to Basbaum, most common types of tinned fish tend to contain low levels of mercury , making them safe to eat regularly. “However, when it comes to tuna and mackerel, some species do contain high levels of mercury and are best to avoid,” Basbaum says, specifically noting bigeye tuna and king mackerel. Check out this reference chart from the FDA/EPA to see what fish have the lowest levels of mercury. Bisphenol A, better known as BPA, is a chemical component often found in food packaging ( 6 ). “According to the Food and Drug Administration, BPA presence in food packaging is considered safe , as only very small amounts of BPA can migrate from food packaging to the food itself,” Basbaum says. On the other hand, other organizations oppose the FDA’s stance on BPA—so the topic is a bit up in the air. When selecting a tinned fish, Basbaum recommends selecting a can packed in water , with a fish that is high in omega-3s and low in mercury . Tinned fish packed in oil contains more calories than fish packed in water. Additionally, if fish are canned in oil, some of the healthy omega-3 fats in the fish can migrate into the surrounding oil ( 7 ) and be lost when the fish is drained. This may not be an issue if you use the flavorful oil in whatever you’re making. “Unless someone is looking for a particular flavor or texture from oil-packed tinned fish, I’d recommend the water-packed,” Basbaum says. Basbaum also says that the best tinned fish to eat are those highest in omega-3s and lowest in mercury ( 8 ). These fish include: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that you eat at least 8 ounces of seafood per week ( 9 ). This guideline is for a 2,000 calorie diet, so numbers can vary depending on the person. Tinned fish can be a good seafood choice to contribute to this 8-ounce benchmark. Although there are small nutritional differences between tinned fish and fresh fish, they are overall pretty similar ( 2 , 10 ). They are both excellent sources of omega-3s, protein, vitamins, and minerals. Basbaum does not recommend one over the other. Tinned fish is already fully cooked and ready to eat. But, Basbaum says that in order to best preserve omega-3 fatty acids, it is best not to overdo it with high-heat cooking methods ( 11 ). Canned fish and tinned fish are the same thing, but tinned fish sometimes refers to more gourmet versions. Despite some nutrition concerns, tinned fish is a healthy source of omega-3 fatty acids, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. It offers nutrients comparable to fresh fish—and might come with a more tasty or aesthetic appeal. When it comes to whether you should eat tinned fish or fresh fish, Basbaum says, “I would not recommend one over the other. Instead, I’d say whichever one will get you to eat more fish, go for that kind!” What matters isn’t the form your fish comes in, but the fact that you’re eating seafood in the first place.

With a buttery whole-grain shortbread crust and a crunchy, sweet-salty fruit-and-nut topping, these little gems are a perfect treat to share during the holidays. Dried cranberries are a good source of fiber (4g per 1/2 cup) but because they are naturally tart, many brands are loaded with added sugar ( 1 ). Fortunately, there are brands of dried cranberries that contain less added sugar or are sweetened with apple juice. Read labels carefully and you can cut the added sugar. Active time: 25 minutes | Total time: 1 hour, plus cooling time For the crust For the filling Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C) . Line an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two opposite sides to create a sling for easy removal. To make the crust: In a food processor, combine the flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder. Pulse a few times to blend. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs, with butter pieces no larger than a lentil, about 20 pulses. Add the vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon of water. Pulse 5 times, or just until the dough begins to clump together. The mixture should hold together easily when pressed between your fingers. If it feels too dry, add more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, pulsing briefly after each addition. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is lightly golden. Remove from the oven and set aside. To make the filling:In a medium bowl, whisk together the maple syrup, melted butter, egg, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth. Stir in the chopped walnuts and dried cranberries. Pour the filling evenly over the warm crust. Return the pan to the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the filling is bubbly and the nuts are lightly browned.

With largely preventable diet-related diseases among the top causes of death and economic burden in the U.S., integrating nutrition into medical training is essential to preparing future clinicians and reversing these trends. As the leading scientific society focused on nutrition research and practice, ASN has evidence-based nutrition resources to equip physicians and other health care professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to provide sound nutrition advice. Current resources and tools are available at nutrition.org/resources-for-healthcare-providers . “The American Society for Nutrition has long supported the need for more nutrition education in medical schools and applauds this important initiative. Physicians and all health care professionals must have accurate nutrition knowledge to help Americans live healthier lives,” said John E. Courtney, Ph.D., ASN Chief Executive Officer. “ASN has advocated for the establishment of a coordinating center to align stakeholders, centralize resources, and strengthen training opportunities. Our organization is well positioned to provide the nutrition expertise and tools that medical schools and residency programs need to integrate meaningful nutrition education into their curricula.” ASN is committed to working with educators, health systems, policymakers, and health care professionals to ensure that nutrition education is incorporated and sustained throughout medical training. Physicians should be equipped to recognize nutrition-related needs, provide basic counseling, and refer patients to registered dietitians (RDs/RDNs)for more specialized, in-depth care. Working together, health care teams can better prevent and manage chronic diseases and improve patient outcomes through optimal nutrition. For physicians seeking to further expand their nutrition expertise, the National Board of Physician Nutrition Specialists (NBPNS) offers credentialing through an independent assessment and certification process. Earning certification as a Physician Nutrition Specialist demonstrates a physician’s advanced competency in clinical nutrition.

This diversity is the fundamental strength of our professional society. Through this member spotlight series , we celebrate our diversity and the vast achievements made by our members in the field. Meet Dr. Christos Katsanos, Associate Professor at Arizona State University, Adjunct Faculty at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, and an ASN member for 18 years. In a conversation with ASN’s Member Engagement Coordinator, Sara Genell, he reflects on what sparked his interest in exercise physiology, the vital role nutrition science has played in his career, and his active involvement with ASN. As 2024–25 Chair of the Energy and Macronutrient Metabolism (EMM) Research Interest Section, Dr. Katsanos helped lead the EMM GEM Forum Meeting the Nutritional Needs of Patients on Anti-Obesity Medications: What’s New? at NUTRITION 2025. He also shared his perspective as Guest Editor for the upcoming joint special issue of The Journal of Nutrition and The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition on Nutritional Considerations in the Era of Emerging Obesity Medications , highlighting the types of submissions he hopes to see. Sara Genell: Thank you, Dr. Katsanos, for joining me today for this interview. For our readers who have not yet met you,  can you please introduce yourself and share what sparked your interest in exercise physiology and macronutrient metabolism? Dr. Christos Katsanos : Thank you, Sara, for this opportunity to speak directly to the ASN Membership Community. I am an Associate Professor at Arizona State University and an Adjunct Faculty at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. I have always been fascinated by the human body and its remarkable ability to adapt to exercise, which led me to focus my graduate training on exercise science. Alongside this, I have long been interested in how nutrition contributes to promoting health and preventing disease, and how exercise may impact nutrient metabolism. Thus, while my formal graduate work was in exercise physiology, nutrition has always been an integral part of my research, and for my doctoral work I studied postprandial metabolism of dietary fat in response to exercise. Genell: As someone with formal training in exercise science, how did you hear about ASN and what led you to joining as a member? Dr. Katsanos : I have been a member of ASN since 2007 and attended my first annual meeting, at the time as part of the Experimental Biology meetings, during my postdoctoral training. I had the opportunity to present my research on the role of amino acid supplementation in regulating protein metabolism in older adults. From that experience, ASN felt like a natural professional home, offering an ideal venue to present my research and engage with colleagues who share similar scientific interests. Genell: We are so fortunate to have you heavily involved within the ASN Community. One avenue in particular is through your leadership as the Chair for the Energy and Macronutrient Metabolism (EMM) GEM. You served during the 2024-2025 term and are now past-chair. What inspired you to become further involved as EMM Gem Chair? Dr. Katsanos : Over the years, I came to appreciate the importance of having a voice in shaping scientific agendas and supporting initiatives that advance our field. Serving as a GEM Chair provides an opportunity to do exactly that, while also strengthening connections with both established leaders and emerging scientists. It allows to further develop leadership, organizational, and communication skills that are essential in both academia and the broader scientific community. Given that ASN has been instrumental in my own professional growth, the GEM position offers a meaningful way to give back by contributing my time and expertise to help the Society continue to thrive. Genell: Can you speak a little bit about the EMM Gem Forum: ‘Meeting the Nutritional Needs of Patients on Anti-Obesity Medications: What’s New? ‘ that you chaired at NUTRITION 2025? What do you think were the biggest takeaways for folks who may have missed this session? Dr. Katsanos : This session was timely given how transformative the latest generation of obesity medications have been by producing unprecedented weight loss and significant improvements in health outcomes. However, one of the big gaps in the field is that we know surprisingly little about dietary intake, nutrient status, and optimal nutrition strategies for individuals on these medications. The session discussed how to ensure long-term health benefit by integrating nutrition strategies we currently are familiar with, largely as part of other weight loss interventions, directly into this obesity pharmacotherapy. A highlight of the session was the overview of the recent multi-society advisory, “Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity”, which ASN co-endorsed, and which synthesizes current knowledge in the area of nutrition for patients on the new obesity medications. One of the biggest takeaways was that there is an urgent need for evidence-based nutrition and lifestyle guidance tailored to patients on obesity medications. The consensus was that in order to maximize health outcomes, these treatments must be accompanied by well-structured nutrition strategies that address emerging challenges and ensure patients not only lose weight but also maintain muscle mass, bone health, and overall metabolic well-being. Genell: In addition to your time dedicated to the EMM GEM, y ou are a guest editor of a joint special issue between The Journal of Nutrition and The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition on the topic of Nutrition Considerations in the Era of Emerging Obesity Medications. Can you share a little about the submissions you are hoping to receive? Dr. Katsanos : This special issue is a natural extension of the EMM GEM forum held at NUTRITION 2025, highlighting the urgent need for evidence-based nutrition and lifestyle guidance for individuals using the new obesity medications. We invite authors to submit work that explores dietary patterns, assesses nutritional status, describes macro- and micronutrient metabolism and requirements, evaluates supplementation effectiveness, and outlines strategies to address emerging nutritional challenges and improve health outcomes in this patient population. Authors are encouraged to consider either of these journals as the best fit for their submissions. Genell : What motivated you to help lead this joint special issue? Dr. Katsanos : Besides aligning closely with my research interests, I was inspired to help lead this special issue because it addresses a critical and timely gap in literature. The use of new obesity medications is increasing rapidly, yet we still lack a comprehensive understanding of nutrition’s role in this modern era. I hope this issue will unite contributions from both basic science and clinical research, ultimately filling key knowledge gaps and advancing the field. By opening submissions to two of the society’s flagship journals, one focused on basic research and the other more on clinical studies, this special issue creates a platform that provides the opportunity to publish original and review articles spanning from bench to bedside. Genell: Thank you for your insight into the special issue. I hope our readers feel motivated to submit their original or review work. To wrap up, can you leave some advice to our Early Career investigator readers who are looking to get more involved in ASN? Dr. Katsanos : I would recommend them to start by attending and presenting at the ASN annual meeting. This is key to gain visibility, receive feedback, and expand your network. Join an ASN Interest Group that aligns with your research and professional goals, as it provides direct connections with colleagues and opens the door to leadership opportunities. And don’t forget to take advantage of ASN’s year-round resources, including webinars, and volunteering opportunities, to stay engaged beyond the annual meeting.

This diversity is the fundamental strength of our professional society. Through this member spotlight series , we celebrate our diversity and the vast achievements made by our members in the field. Meet ASN’s 2025–2026 President, Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa, PhD, DFASN, FTOS, FAHA. A dedicated ASN member since 1994, Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa has served the Society in numerous leadership roles, including Director At-Large for the Nutrition Science Mechanisms Research Interest Section, as well as on various committees and in other GEM leadership positions. Earlier this year, she was inducted into the 2025 Class of Distinguished Fellows of ASN (DFASN), the highest honor awarded by the Society. Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa officially began her term on June 18, 2025, succeeding Sarah L. Booth, PhD, who now serves as Past President. We first spotlighted Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa’s work in 2023, and in the following interview, ASN’s Member Engagement Coordinator, Sara Genell, reconnects with her to discuss her presidential priorities and vision for ASN. Sara Genell : Thank you, Dr. Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa, for participating in this member spotlight interview. Your interview from December 2023 introduced you, your background, and involvement with ASN, so for this interview, I’d like to focus on your presidential priorities, if that’s alright with you. Dr. Naïma Moustaïd-Moussa : Hi Sara, thank you for giving me the opportunity to address the Society. Let’s dive right in. Genell : Great! To begin, can you highlight a couple of your presidential priorities and how you plan to achieve them during your term? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : Two of my presidential priorities relate to expanding and strengthening global partnerships. While ASN is US-based, it is a global society as its members come from 115 countries from around the world.  We already have several ongoing partnerships with international nutrition societies or associations that I have been working on with ASN staff, especially with Senior Vice President, Business Development and Sales, Dante Preciado, and our Chief Executive Officer, Dr. John Courtney. One of my priorities will focus specifically on partnerships with Africa and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) countries, and South America, as well as engaging with specific international organizations interested in nutrition science and/or food systems such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).  To do so, I am actively communicating and engaging with leaders from these organizations to identify effective collaborations of mutual interest that advance nutrition science and benefit our members.  My other relevant priority with a global reach is to expand ASN’s role in advocacy, policy and education in the US and abroad to support its members. An important goal here is to advocate for nutrition research and education nationally and globally, with emphasis on developing the nutrition workforce and our future leaders, and to advocate for the importance of appropriate funding and training to support this nutrition workforce.  ASN’s Chief Science Policy Officer, Sarah Ohlhorst, has already been doing exceptional work in nutrition policy and advocacy, and I look forward to working with her to further advance this area. These partnerships add value to our members, support the ASN 2028 Vision , and increase ASN’s role as a premier nutrition society, as we provide opportunities for ASN members locally, regionally and internationally, to collaborate, share mentoring opportunities, and increase nutrition knowledge across the globe. These priorities will engage our ASN members from private, government and academic institutions in the US and worldwide, across the different areas of nutrition research, education, and practice. Genell : Are there any specific initiatives or programs you’d like to implement or expand upon during your term? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : I have continued to attend ASN meetings since 1994, from the EB meetings to NUTRITION meetings and I enjoy learning from the breadth of nutrition research and practice being presented during our flagship annual meeting.  However, there is also great value in interacting in smaller groups around specific topics of interest to various members, especially for our early career members.  Such opportunities will reengage more basic science researchers in ASN. For this reason, I will be working with ASN members, staff and the Board of Directors to develop regional conferences and workshops on specific topics related to nutrition. Professional development activities for early- and mid-career members will also be included. This will be achieved by working with ASN members, GEMs and ASN staff, namely Gwen Twillman, ASN’s Chief Programs and Advancement Officer and Felicia Price, ASN’s Chief Administration Officer and ASN Foundation (ASNF) Executive Director. Besides GEMs, other important partners in this initiative include the Academic Nutrition Departments and Programs (ANDP) Community , our Sustaining Partners (SP) , and various relevant nutrition-related professional societies and organizations. Given the cost involved, this will also require exploring revenue opportunities for sustainability of new and existing conferences through grants, sponsorship and other financial support. Specialized conferences such as these could also be organized as pre- or post- NUTRITION events, as well as incorporated into the annual meeting schedule for maximal involvement.  I envision that this will increase overall member participation in areas of interest to them, reengage and increase involvement of basic scientists but also other areas of nutrition science and practice. I look forward to hearing from ASN members who are interested in helping organize or participate in these scientific conferences and programs. Genell: Speaking of our annual NUTRITION meeting, you have transitioned into your Presidential term just after our flagship annual meeting, NUTRITION 2025. What were your biggest takeaways from the meeting this year, in terms of trends and/or the state of the field? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa: NUTRITION 2025 was a great conference highlighting state-of-the-art science, from basic, translation, and clinical research to community/population research, policy and practice. There was a wealth of information and new knowledge presented. A few important topics remain present and relevant year after year ranging from maternal-child health, and prenatal nutrition to various bioactive compounds that improve health. This year at NUTRITION 2025, we had two new award lectures through partnership of the ASNF and the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF) that sponsored these awards, which funded two exceptional scientists: the 2025 ASNF-NNF Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches in Childhood Obesity by Dr. Andrew Agbaje, University of Eastern Finland, and the 2025 ASNF-NNF Henrik Dam Award for foundational and translational nutrition research by Dr. Julia L. Finkelstein from Cornell University. The Opening Session highlighted another timely topic on food security and food access during periods of emergencies, natural disaster and war situations and the importance of attending to nutritional needs during such challenging situations across the lifespan. The importance and role of the gut microbiome and gut health in health and disease remained a key topic this year as well, with several presentations on rigorous approaches in this field, from methodologies, data collection and analyses to interpretation to impact. Other timely lectures highlighted where ASN members and the nutrition field can make a difference. This specifically pertained to anti-obesity drugs (GLP1-RA), that often come with potential malnutrition, thus the importance of raising awareness of the nutritional needs and requirements of patients on these effective medications. Last but not least, I am very proud to see ASN continuing to support and engage early career scientists, especially during these challenging times for the workforce in academia or government. There were many presentations and award competitions across the nutrition areas by early career members and many professional and career development activities, some of which were supported by our SPs. Genell: ASN’s membership covers all career stages and many disciplines within nutrition science. How do you recommend members get involved with the Society to grow their networks and careers? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : Nutrition is a very broad multi- and trans-disciplinary field. I highly encourage ASN members to maximize their participation in ASN and ASN conferences which provide an opportunity to learn about many relevant topics that may help them further elevate the work they do. Some members may only attend sessions related to their specific research at NUTRITION conferences, but by doing so they are missing opportunities to potentially expand their work into new and novel directions.  Poster sessions and networking events are great opportunities to meet potential new mentors and collaborators from across the globe and increase our knowledge. There are many opportunities to volunteer in GEMs . This is how I started my involvement in ASN back in the 1990s. I joined the Nutrient-Gene Interactions Research Interest Section (NGI RIS) back when I was a new assistant professor. Through the NGI RIS, I met many colleagues and collaborators that enriched my career and shaped my research trajectory; I also went on to serve as Chair of the NGI RIS and continued to be involved in ASN in various scientific and leadership capacities. Genell: Thinking back to your interview with us from December 2023, how has your perspective evolved, if at all, now that you are stepping into this new role as ASN President? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : Increasingly, we all realize that our world is very interconnected, as highlighted most recently by the COVID-19 pandemic.  I firmly believe that exchange and sharing of knowledge is very important. Scientists do this, but this exchange becomes even more valuable when shared across the globe, not just within one country or one region. At the current time, nutrition is an even more critical area to advance, not only within human nutrition or food science but also through integrating the One Health approach to understand how our interactions with animals affect our health and nutritional status, and how environmental contaminants or pollutants such as PFAS and microplastics, or extreme weather conditions such as drought and floodings or natural disasters affect human health (and animal health) and how nutritional status may contribute to the spread of or aggravate infectious diseases. Situations may be different from one region or country to another, but we can learn from each other through exchange of information and knowledge. That is why you see One Health as one of my priorities. Genell: You are the executive director of the Institute for One Health Innovation. In what ways will you bring a One Health perspective to leading ASN? Why do you feel it is important to take a One Health lens when conducting nutrition research? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : One of my priorities is to raise awareness about the importance of the One Health approach in nutrition research, education and practice.   One Health is the most sustainable approach to achieve optimal health for all, by recognizing that the health of animals, humans, plants and ecosystems are closely connected and intertwined, and we must view health and healthcare more holistically.  One Health integrates disciplines from basic nutrition and food sciences, or plant and animal sciences, to environmental health to solve challenges in our food systems that impact human nutrition and health. Towards this goal, we recently published an editorial on Advancing One Health in The Journal of Nutrition where we also announced a special issue on One Health inviting ASN members to showcase their research in this area.  The editorial provides some additional examples of the intricate role of One Health in human nutrition and health. An example that many can relate to are food systems and agricultural production and practices, focused on the role of soil health in human health; specifically, how soil quality and microbial composition impacts crops’ (food) nutritional value and content, which in turn affects animal or human health. We also know that conditions such as extreme temperatures, drought, flooding, and other environmental factors can change these interactions. These are all current and continuing challenges that require multidisciplinary experts to work together and contribute the expertise needed to solve these challenges. In addition to this special issue, I look forward to more programming by ASN on the topic of One Health including at NUTRITION 2026 and throughout the year. These activities further support ASN’s 2028 vision, ASN journals’ reach and visibility, and provide opportunities for more collaboration with industry, animal, food and environmental sciences and agricultural disciplines and organizations. Genell: How do you think (or hope) the field of nutrition science and practice will evolve in the next 10 years? What is ASN’s role in this evolution? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : We have seen the increased prevalence of emerging infectious diseases but also the sustained increase in non-communicable diseases such as obesity and diabetes; and these will continue to pose economic and health burdens. Nutrition research may be at the center of solving these challenges. We have made significant progress in the past decade towards precision and individualized nutrition through the development of sophisticated omics tools and nutritional assessment tools. However, much work remains to be done to achieve true precision nutrition. We still rely on self-reported data, and many advanced methods used in the clinic are not always easily transposable to the community. Methodologies have been improved to more accurately measure food intake and assess biomarkers of health including research on gut microbiota or their metabolites that affect health. However, implementation of these advances at the community level are not there yet and much remains to be done on translating findings from microbiome research into therapies.  I anticipate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play an increasingly greater role in implementing precision nutrition and in translating and accelerating research applications into clinical practice.  As mentioned above, emerging infectious diseases are major threats, and we do not fully understand the role of nutrition deficiencies or malnutrition on the spread of these diseases in animals or humans. Genell: Thank you again, Dr. Moustaïd -Moussa, for addressing our Society through this spotlight interview. Are there any closing remarks or call to action you would like to leave with the ASN members reading this interview? Dr. Moustaïd-Moussa : ASN has had a great impact on my career and professional development, and I highly encourage our members, especially early- and mid-career members, to actively engage in ASN and help guide and shape the future vision of ASN and nutrition research, education and practice.  This is such an important time for nutrition science, as our field plays an increasingly critical role in shaping national and global health. ASN members have a big responsibility to ensure that we are guided by evidence-based nutrition. We must also communicate what we do to our stakeholders and policymakers. Related to my priorities , I look forward to hearing feedback from our members and partners, and to see them engaged not only in these priorities, as relevant, but overall to advance nutrition science and the ASN 2028 vision to achieve a healthier world through nutrition.

Washington, D.C. (May 30, 2025) – Four leading organizations in lifestyle medicine, obesity medicine, and nutrition—the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), the American Society for Nutrition (ASN), the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA), and The Obesity Society (TOS)—have jointly released a clinical advisory titled “Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity.” Published across four peer-reviewed journals, this consensus-based guidance reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration to help clinicians support patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity care with evidence-based nutritional and behavioral strategies. GLP-1 therapies, including both single and combination agents, have emerged as powerful tools in the management of obesity, demonstrating average placebo-adjusted weight reductions of 5–18% in clinical trials , along with improvements in metabolic, functional and cardiovascular outcomes. However, sustaining these benefits over time and maximizing patient outcomes require comprehensive care that integrates lifestyle intervention—particularly nutrition therapy—into the treatment plan. “GLP-1s represent an important advancement in obesity care,” said lead author and advisory chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, of Tufts University. “But these medications can present challenges, including gastrointestinal side effects, risk of micronutrient deficiencies, muscle and bone loss, poor long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain, and high costs; and, on their own, are not enough. Nutrition therapy and lifestyle support are essential components to address these challenges, help patients maximize and maintain health gains over time, and ensure we are using these drugs wisely, effectively, and without bankrupting the healthcare system.” The advisory outlines eight key nutritional priorities to support patients on GLP-1 medications, emphasizing the importance of (1) patient-centered initiation of therapy, (2) careful baseline nutritional assessment, (3) management of gastrointestinal side effects, (4) personalized, nutrient-dense, minimally processed diets, (5) prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (6) adequate protein intake and strength training to preserve lean mass, (7) leveraging a good diet to maximize weight reduction, and (8) promoting other lifestyle changes around activity, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections to maximize long-term success. Recent evidence supports this integrative model. In studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions, patients receiving both GLP-1 therapy and structured nutrition guidance achieved greater weight loss, better adherence, and were more likely to sustain weight loss after discontinuing medication compared to those receiving pharmacotherapy alone (Jastreboff et al., 2022; Wadden et al., 2023; White et al., 2023; Wilding et al., 2021; Wilding et al., 2022; Wilding et al., 2023). Despite the known benefits, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s do not currently receive adequate nutritional counseling or behavioral support. This advisory seeks to fill that gap with practical, interdisciplinary guidance for implementation in clinical practice. While certain considerations—such as GI tolerance and micronutrient balance—are important for clinicians to address, the advisory emphasizes that a proactive lifestyle-based approach can mitigate risks and optimize outcomes. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise worldwide, the integration of nutrition therapy into GLP-1-based care offers a scalable strategy to extend the clinical and economic value of these therapies. The joint advisory is simultaneously published in the following scholarly journals: ● American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) ● The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (ASN) ● Obesity Pillars® (OMA) ● Obesity (TOS) Clinicians are encouraged to use the advisory’s tools and frameworks to help patients translate nutrition guidance into sustainable behaviors, making lifestyle medicine an active ingredient in every “prescription” for obesity care.

Supporting quotes: “GLP-1s are transforming the treatment of obesity, with immense potential for weight loss and improving health outcomes,” said Jasdeep Saluja, MD, FRCPC, DipABLM, DipABOM, chair of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine’s GLP-1 Task Force. “This joint advisory offers practical priorities for incorporating nutritional and other lifestyle treatments into GLP-1 therapy to maximize effectiveness, obtain more equitable outcomes, and optimize cost-effectiveness in the real world. As clinicians navigate the shifting care landscape for obesity, we hope this information empowers them to manage potential pitfalls, such as gastrointestinal side effects, nutritional needs, and preserving skeletal and muscular body mass.” “GLP-1s are reshaping the landscape of obesity treatment, but it’s clear that medication alone is not a complete solution,” stated John E. Courtney, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of the American Society for Nutrition. “This consensus-based guidance highlights the critical role of nutrition in supporting patients on GLP-1 therapy, with clear recommendations for health care providers to optimize outcomes, reduce risks, and fill urgent gaps in care through practical, evidence-informed nutrition strategies.” “As an obesity specialist grounded in both lifestyle and culinary medicine, I see food not just as fuel, but as a foundational tool in clinical care,” stated Lydia Alexander, MD, DABOM, DABLM, MFOMA, Immediate Past President of the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA). “GLP-1 therapies are powerful, but they’re most effective when paired with intentional, nutrient-dense eating patterns that support metabolic health and long-term success. Nutrition is not an afterthought—it’s a therapeutic partner that helps patients sustain weight loss, preserve lean mass, and translate medication-driven progress into lasting well-being.” “Medical therapy for obesity and lifestyle changes go and-in-hand,” stated Marc-Andre Cornier, MD, FTOS, president of The Obesity Society. “This guidance lays a nutrition roadmap to help providers support their patients on sustainable and lasting weight reduction journeys. It underscores the importance of nutrition on quality of life, and is an important contribution to the literature about incorporating lifestyle interventions into obesity care.” About the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM) is the nation’s medical professional society advancing the field of lifestyle medicine as the foundation of a redesigned, value-based and equitable healthcare delivery system, essential to achieving the Quintuple Aim and whole-person health.

Named in honor of trailblazing Danish researchers Henrik Dam and Flemming Quaade, these prestigious new awards aim to spark innovation and support the next generation of leaders in nutrition science. Julia Finkelstein, ScD, MPH, a globally recognized expert in vitamin B 12 and one-carbon metabolism, has been selected as the inaugural recipient of the Henrik Dam Award for Scientific Discovery in Nutrition , which honors mid-career professionals for outstanding research contributions to the understanding of micronutrients, nutritional status, and/or metabolism. She is an Associate Professor of Epidemiology and Nutrition at the Division of Nutritional Sciences, and Director of the Maternal and Child Nutrition Program at Cornell University. Dr. Finkelstein’s groundbreaking research has demonstrated a high global burden of vitamin B 12 deficiency in women of reproductive age and identified a critical role of periconceptional vitamin B 12 in maternal and child health. Through population-based biomarker surveillance, longitudinal cohort studies, and randomized clinical trials, this work has informed evidence-based interventions and policy to improve the health of women and children. With methodological rigor, Dr. Finkelstein’s work has influenced clinical guidelines and nutrition policy globally, including through collaborations with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. Dr. Sander Kersten, the Director of the Division of Nutritional Sciences said, “We are thrilled that Dr. Finkelstein is the inaugural recipient of this new award. It is incredibly well-deserved and recognition of her research and its global impact.” In addition to her scientific achievements, Dr. Finkelstein has demonstrated a deep commitment to mentorship and capacity strengthening globally, including NIH training programs in nutrition and maternal and child health, and the development of Cochrane and nutrition research methods courses that have equipped hundreds of health professionals in low- and middle-income settings with critical research skills. The award includes a research grant of 1.7 million Danish kroner (DKK) (~$240,000 USD); a personal award of 300,000 DKK (~$42,000 USD); a grant to host a symposium at her home institution; and an invited plenary lecture at NUTRITION 2025 , the flagship meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, taking place May 31–June 3, 2025, in Orlando, Florida. Andrew Agbaje, MD, MPH, PhD, FACC, FESC, FHAA, FNYAM has been named the first recipient of the Flemming Quaade Award for Innovative Approaches to Childhood Obesity , honoring early-career physicians who have made exceptional contributions to obesity prevention or management. He currently serves as Associate Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and Child Health at the University of Eastern Finland. Dr. Agbaje’s groundbreaking research has shown that waist circumference-to-height ratio is a more accurate predictor of obesity and metabolic diseases than the traditional Body Mass Index (BMI). He recently launched a clinical calculator based on this metric, offering a potentially transformative tool for the early detection and management of childhood obesity. Dr. Agbaje discovered arterial stiffness as a novel risk factor for pediatric obesity and insulin resistance and was recently named the world’s third-best highly ranked scholar in the arterial stiffness specialty. His work has further revealed adolescence as the critical window for interrupting the fat mass-insulin resistance pathologic cycle. Notably, he has demonstrated that light-intensity physical activity is a highly effective strategy for reversing excessive fat accumulation caused by sedentary behavior in childhood. Dr. Agbaje has served as an expert advisor to the World Health Organization’s committee on childhood obesity prevention. Award benefits include a research grant of 500,000 DKK (~$70,000 USD) and a travel stipend to present a lecture at NUTRITION 2025 . “It is with great pleasure that we congratulate the first two winners of the ASNF-NNF awards. These awards aim to acknowledge early and mid-career professionals for their innovative research within the growing field of nutritional science and health,” expressed Arne Astrup, Professor, MD, DMSc, and Senior Vice President of Obesity and Nutrition Science at the Novo Nordisk Foundation. “Eighty-two years after Henrik Dam received the Nobel prize for his work on Vitamin K, Dr. Finkelstein receives the inaugural ASNF-NNF Henrik Dam Award for her pioneering work on B 12 , hence demonstrating the continued importance of micronutrient research. Nutrition is fundamental to our overall health, and prioritizing research in this field will impact health globally. We look forward to celebrating the winners’ remarkable contributions to the nutrition field at NUTRITION 2025.” Both award lectures will be streamed live through the NUTRITION 2025 Digital Pass . For more information on how to view the lectures, visit nutrition.org/meeting/digital-pass . These awards are part of a multi-year partnership between the ASNF and NNF to recognize rising stars in nutrition research and accelerate breakthroughs in global health. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has committed funding for the awards through 2027 and plays no role in the selection of recipients. “The work of Drs. Finkelstein and Agbaje exemplifies the scientific impact we aim to recognize with these awards. Expanding the evidence base to bridge knowledge gaps and support nutrition interventions is critical,” stated Paul M.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? When it comes to finding new ways to improve your overhead pressing technique, sometimes you've gotta Z it to believe it. Joking aside, the Z press might be one of those moves not every gymgoer is familiar with, but it’s arguably one of the best variations for reinforcing shoulder press form, according to Men’s Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. , and fitness editor Brett Williams, NASM-CPT . What makes it unique is that it’s done on the floor with both legs out in front of you — taking them completely out of the movement and allowing you to focus a whole lot more on core positioning. And of course, the Z press emphasizes pressing overhead without arching your back—especially important once you level up to heavier presses—when performed the right way. So how do you do The exercise correctly? According to Samuel, the best way to start is by going single arm, using a kettlebell—this makes setting up much easier than the awkwardness of having to pull a pair of dumbbells from the floor or wrangling a barbell. You'll be sitting on your butt for the Z press. As far as leg placement, either a wide or narrow base works—it’s more about finding what's comfortable for you, Samuel says. Get the kettlebell into a tight rack position, keeping your forearm perpendicular to the ground and maintaining tension in your shoulder blades. “Here's the strength of the Z press,” Samuel says. “Because our lower body is not part of the equation anymore, you get to think about making sure your abs are nice and tight.” Once that’s set, drive the weight straight up, making sure to get a little squeeze at the top. Samuel says to think about stacking your joints in this position—wrist above your elbow and elbow right above your shoulder, before lowering the weight back down into the rack position. The Z press makes a good first or second exercise in your shoulder or pressing workouts and can be done with either a kettlebell or dumbbell. Stick to about three sets of eight to 12 reps. Over time, you can try adding a heavier load to the move. “It's going to help you really reinforce good shoulder form as it’s going to help you build those shoulders,” Samuel says.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? KETTLEBELLS OFFER PLENTY of bang for your buck. You can use them for strength training , to build muscle , and for explosive movements like snatches and swings. And you can achieve any of these feats with just one kettlebell , making it a tool that’s as simple as it is effective. Not only that, but they are actually fun to use, I've put together plenty of grueling workouts with kettlebells that had me grinning from ear to ear at the end. If you want to get stronger, you’re going to need a kettlebell that’s heavier—and buying multiple bells can get pricey. Our favorite solution is the adjustable kettlebell, which like the best adjustable dumbells and the best weighted vests , are highly versatile pieces of equipment. Our editors researched and tested the most popular—and even lesser-known—adjustable kettlebells to find the six best worth considering for your own home gym . Most adjustable kettlebells have a weight range between 10 and 40 pounds. We looked for brands that offer either a wider range of weights in one kettlebell or multiple kettlebells with different weight ranges. For movements like swings, deadlifts, rows, and push presses, any weight under 40 pounds is too light to be challenging to anyone who isn’t a beginner. Ten to 30 pounds is great for isolation exercises (think curls, lateral raises, and extensions), but won’t pose a proper challenge for the explosive movements that people expect to perform with kettlebells. The handle of your kettlebell needs to be easy to grip, comfortable, and able to fit both of your hands for a variety of exercises. The size of the handle refers to both the diameter (measured in millimeters) and the width of the handle. A competition-grade kettlebell has a handle diameter of 190mm (or 7.5 inches). Unless you’re training specifically for kettlebell sport, you don’t need to worry about buying a kettlebell with those specific dimensions. In fact, some of our testers prefer handles that are thinner in diameter (they’re easier to grip) and wider in length (you can better grab it with both hands). That said, all the kettlebells on this list feature handles that our testers think are comfortable and effective and are millimeters within competition-grade specs. You want an adjustable kettlebell to look and function like a traditional kettlebell, so we mostly chose products that resemble single-weight kettlebells. That said, if there’s a pick on this list that strays from the traditional shape, it’s because we deemed it nonetheless comfortable and/or easy to use. You’re going to run into a handful of different changing mechanisms for the kettlebells below. The two most common are a dial and pin. For the dial, the kettlebell usually sits on top of a stack of plates. You turn the dial to the weight you want, and the mechanism automatically engages the appropriate number of weight plates. To use the pin, you’ll manually insert it into different holes in the kettlebell that correlate to a specific weight (it’s no different than using a weight stack at the gym). Both dials and pins are quick and efficient mechanisms. Dials are often made from plastic so they can be prone to breaking, but this is, in our experience, a rarity and likely won’t happen as long as you use your kettlebell sensibly. Competition-style kettlebells may require you to ratchet open the bell with a wrench and manually add or remove metal plate weights before closing it back up. This is a pain, but the trade off is more stability and durability, and an adjustable kettlebell that’s shaped like and performs like a traditional one. Kettlebell handles aren’t really kettlebells, but handles with an extended pole for you to load weights onto. This process shouldn’t feel too different from loading a barbell. Our team at Men’s Health , including a few certified trainers and former athletes, have used dozens of different models of adjustable kettlebells during our decades of work in the fitness industry. The building of this list was led by Fitness and Commerce Editor Charles Thorp, who started with the previous batch of best-performing models and then put them up against newly-released options, even unreleased options that we have received early access to. We also reached out to our large network of experts, including our Advisory Board , to share their insights and any new designs they've tried. We combined this expansive experience with targeted testing of the top contenders on the market, done along with the writer Andrew Gutman, from upcoming and established brands. During this testing these kettlebells during a wide range of workouts in a variety of environments, whether that was CrossFit WODs at our local box, kettlebell flows in the Men's Health studio gym, or HIIT workouts in our own garages. Look below to check out our favorite picks for every kind of athlete. Our list is competitive. Many iconic brands produce adjustable kettlebells with rave reviews and similar specs. What edged REP’s adjustable kettlebell into our Best Overall spot is that it looks, feels, and performs the most like a standard kettlebell —even the handle diameter is nearly competition-grade—and the price is very fair for the equipment you’re getting. Like nearly everything REP produces, the quality of this kettlebell is standard-setting. The frame is made from cast iron and powder-coated to enhance your grip. The traditional shape enables kettlebell athletes to use this kettlebell, so their training will transfer to competition. Even the bottom of the kettlebell is covered in rubber to protect your floor—a minor detail we appreciate. Typically, you’re paying above market for this level of quality and design, but REP’s adjustable kettlebell is less expensive than other picks on this list. REP offers three different weight ranges: 8-16kg (17-35lbs), 16-24kg (35-53lbs), and 10-40lbs. The kilogram kettlebells adjust in two-kilogram increments, and the kettlebells sold in pounds adjust in five-pound increments. To select your weight, you’ll turn the dial located on the top of the kettlebell (below the handle). You’ll then lift the kettlebell off the weight stack, where the remaining weight plates will sit for the duration of your set or workout. If you want to nitpick, other brands have said that the plastic dial feels cheap and prone to breaking. We want to highlight this detail, but our editors don’t think this is an issue unless you plan on abusing the kettlebell. No matter which weight range you choose, you’re replacing five kettlebells. For general fitness enthusiasts, we like the 10-40lb option; it’s enough weight to challenge you for presses and high-rep sets of squats and rows. If you have some lifting experience and want to primarily train explosive movements like swings and snatches, as one traditionally does with kettlebells, opt for the 16-24kg weight range. Unless you’re a complete beginner, we suggest those two weight ranges. Read More: The Best Kettlebells Bells of Steel created something very cool with this competition-spec adjustable kettlebell. The weight range and increments are fantastic, and the dimensions are exactly to competition spec. You’ll replace 18 kettlebells for less than $300. Two reasons why it’s not our best overall pick are that the adjustment process for this kettlebell is comparatively time-intensive, and a competition-style bell isn’t for everyone. To change the weights of the Bells of Steel kettlebell, you need a few minutes and a couple of tools. You’ll undo the bolt on the bottom of the kettlebell using an Allen wrench, remove the bottom half, and then loosen the other screw, which secures the plates, with a traditional wrench. You can then add more plates in half-kilogram increments to the bolt that runs through the top half of the shell. Because the adjustment process is more time-consuming, this isn’t the best kettlebell for circuits or workouts that demand you to change weights on the fly. At first glance, you probably can’t even tell this is an adjustable kettlebell; it has a smooth cast-iron finish, void of any dials or switches, and the 35-millimeter handle looks identical to standard competition kettlebells. This is the serious kettlebell athlete's adjustable kettlebell. That said, if you’ve never trained with an adjustable kettlebell, be aware that the stainless steel handle can rub the hand raw (use a lot of chalk), it’ll feel more cumbersome than other picks on this list, and the starting weight is over 24 pounds. This is a solid choice if you’re a kettlebell athlete or are looking for a heavier adjustable kettlebell (and you’re okay with the adjustment process). From the company that brought adjustable dumbbells into the mainstream, BowFlex’s SelectTech 840 adjustable kettlebell is a great entry-level model for the kettlebell-curious gym goer. It’s reasonably priced, replaces six kettlebells, and is simple to adjust on the fly. The SelecTtech 840 offers six different weights: Eight, 12, 20, 25, 35, and 40 pounds, enough weight to challenge you during isolation movements like curls and extensions while providing enough resistance for snatches, cleans, and rows. If you’ve been training with kettlebells for a few years, 40 pounds will likely be too light for you, so you’ll want to look for a kettlebell that offers a heavier top-end weight or consider buying two of this model. While it isn’t shaped exactly like a kettlebell, it feels enough like one that anyone who uses a traditional kettlebell won’t be completely thrown off. The dial located on the top of the kettlebell makes adjusting between weights a breeze, and the handle is relatively wide, making two-handed exercises easier to perform. I don’t love the plastic shell, which leaves the SelectTech 840 more prone to breaking if dropped. Also, the handle is smooth, which makes holding onto the bell harder, especially after you’ve worked up a sweat. All in all, this is a basic, easy-to-use kettlebell with a moderately challenging weight range. If you’re a beginner or casual kettlebell user, you’ll enjoy BowFlex’s adjustable kettlebell. Powerblock is best known for its rectangular adjustable dumbbells, which can hold up to 100 pounds, but the brand also produces a rugged and compact adjustable kettlebell with a decent weight range. The 18- to 35-pound kettlebell has dimensions of 5.75″ L x 4.25″ W x 10″ H, while the 35-to-62-pound kettlebell has a dimensions profile of 8″ L x 5.5″ W x 11.25″ H. That’s not drastically smaller than other kettlebells on our list—in fact, Titan’s adjustable kettlebell is half an inch shorter than Powerblock’s heavier kettlebell—but its size relative to the weight range is what earned this pick the superlative of most compact. We like a few things about this kettlebell. First, the handle is wider than most single-weight and adjustable kettlebells, which I like for two-handed movements like swings and upright rows. This kettlebell is also made from steel and feels sturdy and durable. You can drop this and not worry that it will break; there aren’t any plastic parts. Lastly, the untraditional shape may throw off some kettlebell enthusiasts, but I think the sloped sides make it so it sits more comfortably on my wrist. Anyone who snatched or cleaned a traditional kettlebell knows the pressure that can be put on the wrist. Unfortunately, you have to choose between a lighter or heavier kettlebell. Each model replaces just four kettlebells, less than any other pick on this list. With the purchase of either kettlebell, you’ll get the shell plus three weights you can select using a pin. (FYI: You need the pin to choose the weights, and Powerblock doesn’t seem to sell a replacement part.) Sixy-two pounds is a substantial top-end weight for an adjustable kettlebell, with only the Titan Loadable Kettlebell Swing and Bells of Steel Competition Kettlebell offering a heavier weight. We picked Titan as the best budget option because $120 for the equivalent of seven kettlebells is pretty damn good. It looks and (mostly) feels like a traditional kettlebell, is compact, and uses cast-iron plates, which adds to the product’s durability. What we like most about Titan’s kettlebell is its price and shape. Regarding gym equipment, $120 is pretty affordable for almost any product. A 40-pound kettlebell from Titan Fitness costs $70, so add six more kettlebells to your cart, and you’re definitely exceeding $120 bucks. The shape and size are comparable to traditional kettlebells, which means you shouldn’t have a hard time adjusting your technique if you switch over to this model. This kettlebell starts at 10 pounds and goes up to 40 pounds, a good weight range for beginners and intermediate lifters. The weight is light enough to master movements like the snatch, clean, and jerk and to burn out the muscles during exercises like curls and overhead presses. Unfortunately, 40 pounds isn’t enough weight for stronger individuals to get much out of movements like kettlebell swings, rows, chest presses, and deadlifts. If you’re looking to take on high-rep workouts with intensity, you can put this bell to use. However, expect to out-grow this weight range at some point. The weights on this kettlebell aren’t marked, so you need to read the plates on the inside to figure out how much you’re lifting. Ideally, Titan would paint the numbers somewhere on this kettlebell. Also, adjusting Titan’s kettlebell isn’t as easy as most other picks on this list. You need to unlock the plates and then slide them out one at a time. But these are little nuisances in the grander scheme of what you're getting for the price. Read More: The Best Weight Benches We’ll admit that this is more of a kettlebell-adjacent tool, but we're including it on this list because it’s affordable, you can load it up to 500 pounds, it uses weight plates, and you can use it in a few creative ways. First, let’s be clear: Titan’s loadable handle is not a kettlebell replacement. It’s nowhere close to the dimensions of a standard kettlebell, so you can’t perform classic kettlebell movements like the snatch, clean, and jerk. As the name implies, Titan’s Loadable Kettlebell Swing is for swinging, with the main benefit being that you can load it with hundreds of pounds. Swinging this handle will not feel like swinging a kettlebell. It’s 19 inches tall, eight inches taller than a competition kettlebell. You’ll probably feel unstable and unbalanced the first few times you swing this handle, as the plates are relatively far from your center of gravity. You’re also going to need to assume a wider stance than you’re used to when using standard kettlebells. A competition kettlebell is 8.25 inches wide. By comparison, some metal 45-pound plates are nearly 17 inches across, and 25-pound plates are almost 12 inches across. We suggest loading 5-, 10-, and 25-pound plates onto the handle so you don’t have to set your stance as wide. Even though you can’t technically replace a kettlebell with this handle, it’s still a valuable and fun addition to any home gym. Aside from heavy swings, you can perform one-arm rows, upright rows, single-arm farmer’s carries, duck walks, and elevated sumo deadlifts with this handle. We say “addition” to a home gym because this handle is an excellent buy if you own weight plates. Otherwise, you’ll need to shell out extra money for the plates to load this handle. If you’re looking for a pure kettlebell replacement, Titan’s Loadable Kettlebell Swing is not for you. However, with a $50 price tag and a 500-pound weight capacity, we think serious strength athletes will love this unique tool's ability to perform heavy swings, rows, elevated deadlifts, and carries.

    "combined_text": "This Father of Four Lost 100 Pounds on a GLP-1\n\n<p>After years of failed diets, Brian turned to telehealth and a GLP-1. Not only did he lose weight, he stopped snoring and rebuilt his life.</p>\n\nBrian W. had tried to lose weight for years with no success. After his health continued to suffer—his blood pressure and blood sugar levels were high and he’d developed sleep apnea—he turned to telehealth, where a doctor prescribed him a GLP-1. The medication affected his appetite—which then changed his life. NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS were never hard for me. Every year, I knew exactly what I wanted to do: lose weight. The hard part came next. Actually doing it. Don’t get me wrong—I’d tried all sorts of diets. (Once, I even tried intermittent fasting, which isn’t for the faint of heart.) I’d stay strong for a while, but I’d eventually fall back into my normal habits of overeating. I knew the weight was taking a toll on my health. At 261 pounds, I had high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels. I had also developed sleep apnea, a disorder where I temporarily stopped breathing at night. My snoring was so bad that my wife would go sleep in a different bedroom. I was miserable, but felt like there was nothing I could do about it. I had tried for so long to lose weight, only to backslide a few months later. I’d lost all confidence in myself. I no longer believed it was possible. I HIT ROCK bottom in December of 2023. I had just gotten back from a vacation in Jamaica with my wife. It would have been a great trip if I hadn’t taken any pictures of myself. I was shocked at how big I had become. I thought, “Oh my God, I’m huge.” I knew I could have a heart attack or stroke at any minute. I owed it to my wife and four children to be around for as long as I possibly could. A few months later, I saw a commercial for LifeMD , a telehealth company that connects people with board-certified doctors for health conditions like obesity, diabetes, and insomnia. After I did some lab work, I started meeting online with a doctor, who prescribed a GLP-1 medication called Mounjaro, off label, for weight loss. Was I a little skeptical at first? Of course. You have to be. But I’d tried everything else to lose weight—so why not this? Right away, though, I noticed two big things: I started taking Mounjaro in February 2024, and right away, I noticed a change in my appetite. The medication works by inhibiting a hormone that affects appetite and slows down the rate of digestion, so you feel fuller, longer. I went from overeating all the time, to leaving half of my meal on the plate because I was so full. That was one of the biggest changes to my diet — my portion sizes were so much smaller. I didn’t want to just fill up with junk food, though, so I swapped some unhealthier stuff for, say, a protein shake at breakfast. That also sat better in my stomach—especially because I couldn’t eat as much food without feeling bloated. In the past, I barely worked out at all. I just didn’t have the energy. Once I started taking the medication, though, it was much easier to be active. It was a relief not to be out of breath all the time. I started off slow, with daily walks, and then started running, too. Then I started biking again. Now, I do all three—and love it. SO FAR, I’VE lost 100 pounds—and I’m happy to say that you can tell. I used to wear a size 2X in shirts and a size 42 or 44-inch waist. Now, I wear a size medium and have a 29-inch waist. Needless to say, shopping is fun again. I like the way I look these days—but even more so, I like the way I feel. I have so much more energy now, and my confidence is through the roof. Part of that is because I sleep better. (And so does my wife, since I don’t snore anymore.) But it’s also because I feel optimistic. When I look at my kids now, I don’t worry so much about having a heart attack. I feel hopeful that I’ll be around long enough to see them grow old someday.

    "combined_text": "The Copenhagen Plank Will Upgrade Your Ab Workout\n\n<p>This plank variation challenges even the strongest core–and gives runners an extra form boost, too. </p>\n\nHow often have you dismissed the plank? Sure, it's a simple movement that doesn't stir much excitement when you see someone holding the position in a corner of the gym—but if you level up to one of the toughest variations of the exercise around, the Copenhagen plank, you won't be so quick to snub your nose. Underrated and underused (and maybe initially overwhelming on first attempt),  the Copenhagen plank without question is one of the most challenging plank variations out there. One major advantage of the Copenhagen plank is that there’s little chance that you'll get bored. Forget counting your reps in minutes. If you do it right, you should be giving everything you have for seconds. But once you master it, according to Men’s Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., and fitness editor Brett Williams, N.A.S.M., the Copenhagen plank will provide plenty of core-crushing benefits, especially if you're a runner. Normally when we think side plank, we prioritize bracing our entire core. The Copenhagen is a little bit different, according to Samuel. “Because we're going to work a lot of lateral stability in this plank, you're going to start to get a lot of hip effect,” Samuel says. “Your adductors and abductors and both your inner and outer thighs are going to wind the firing in this move as well.” You’ll also notice that you’re actually set up in a position that mirrors a runner's stride, so be aware of reinforcing a good, high-knee position, and make sure you can own it in the sagittal plane. Get Set Up on the Bench To start, you’ll need a bench, or ideally a raised platform that doesn’t have a back on it, like an ottoman. This will allow you to scale your plank’s difficulty level. And trust us, you’ll first need to make adjustments. Place your top shin on the bench. You’ll notice the closer you get your knee to the bench, the easier it becomes as you’re working with less lever. Move it out more, and the lever becomes longer and more challenging. We suggest starting about two inches out. Hold a Strong Side Plank From here, think of a side plank.In other  words, place your forearm perpendicular to your torso on the ground—that's going to protect your shoulder, then shift into a safer external rotation. Think about squeezing both shoulder blades and glutes. You’re almost there, but Samuel says there’s one final piece to the Copenhagen puzzle. As this move is already creating a ton of tension through your glutes and shoulder blades, keeping your free leg raised and in the proper 90 degree position is serious anti-rotation work for your core. For runners, this position reinforces the posture you want when you run. Again, you’ll hold a Copenhagen plank nowhere near the same amount of time you would a standard plank. And since it is so challenging, it’s best to make this your first move of your core workout. Remember the Copenhagen keys: maintain stability and squeeze your glutes and shoulder blades while fighting off rotation in both directions. If you can nail those, you’ve just dominated the once-indomitable exercise. “That's what makes this a great plank,” Samuel says.  “This is a super challenging move, but that’s the idea.” Want to master even more moves?

    "combined_text": "The 6 Best Cooling Towels, Tested by Fitness Editors and Trainers\n\n<p>When the heat is slowing you down, these towels are here for you.<br></p>\n\nOur product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? WHEN YOU'RE WORKING hard in the gym or in the yard, heat can make an already challenging experience even more brutal. And any regular gym goer knows that with enough people crammed into a small area, the temperature can rise quickly while you're in the middle of your workout. No matter what the date on the calendar says, when you're feeling the heat during outdoor work or workouts , finding a way to cool down is essential. That's where cooling towels come to the rescue, offering a quick and convenient method to lower body temperature and beat the heat (and less obstructive than a neck fan ). Made from high-tech fabrics including antimicrobial microfiber and PVA with evaporative technology that activate with water, these towels have become a must-have accessory for beachgoers , backyard enthusiasts, and fitness hounds alike. While they don't provide hydration or full-body sun protection , and don't have the same absorbtion of standard gym towels , cooling towels serve as a valuable tool in hot and humid weather conditions , especially when putting in work for your summer body . To guide you towards the best cooling towels on the market, we conducted our own extensive research and consulted MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S . Our selection process is meticulous and comprehensive, focusing on key features including material quality, activation mechanism, cooling performance, technological features, and affordability. Each cooling towel on our list has been subjected to rigorous evaluation to determine its effectiveness across a range of scenarios. Different cooling towels utilize various technologies to provide cooling relief. Some towels rely on evaporative cooling only, while others may incorporate cooling gels or advanced fabric technologies. For safety purposes, consumers with pets or small children should steer clear of towels made with cooling gels or alcohol-based fabrics. The material of a cooling towel plays a crucial role in its effectiveness and comfort. Look for towels made of fabrics like microfiber or PVA (Polyvinyl acetate) that are soft against the skin and provide optimal moisture absorption. Consider the size of the cooling towel and whether it offers sufficient coverage for your desired application. Larger towels may be more versatile, allowing you to drape them around your neck, wrap them around your head, or use them on larger areas of the body (which is especially great for sun protection). Some towels, like those from FROGG TOGGS, may even be cut to size based on your specific preferences. A high-quality towel should be reusable and withstand multiple uses and washes without losing its cooling properties or falling apart. Look for towels that are easy to activate and require minimal maintenance. Consider whether the towel can be easily reactivated by simple steps like wetting, wringing, or snapping. Similarly, you'll likely want a machine washable towel to ensure cleaning is low-maintenance. Some cooling towels may offer extra features such as UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) sun protection, antimicrobial properties, carrying cases, or the ability to cut or customize the towel's size to fit your needs. Being the Fitness and Commerce Editor of Men's Health means I get my hands on every piece of new gym gear that releases, sometimes before it releases. To build this guide to the best cooling towels, I took the existing best-selling towels on the market and put them up against any previously overlooked classics and newly released options. I used these to cool my summer workouts, using each towel across multiple modalities to examine how effective they were. Other editors on the team were consulted, including our fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., and we put countless cooling towels through the paces and evaluated their effectiveness, durability, comfort, and cooling technology. We also considered price point, as some cooling towels provide a better overall value than others. Our team tested these towels in the gym, on the track, and during group classes. So, whether you're a dedicated runner, outdoor CrossFit fitness enthusiast, or someone who simply enjoys spending time in the sun, read on to discover the best cooling towels to keep you comfortable when things heat up.

One downside: It's pretty spacious and requires some securing to stay in place while moving about. Luckily, there's a snap closure to help with that Cooling towels work by leveraging a process known as evaporative cooling to produce a their chilly sensation. The mechanism involves the interaction between the towel, water, and air. Here's how it works: For the cooling towels included in our list, cleaning and maintaining is no different than how you'd care for a traditional sweat towel. If the towel becomes soiled, simply pop it into a washing machine with standard clothing detergent and rinse thoroughly. If you don't have access to a washing machine, hand washing works well, too. In case of mildew or odor development, soak the towel in a mixture of 1 tablespoon baking soda to 1 gallon of warm water for an hour or two before washing. When it comes to drying, we recommend checking the specific towel's instructions. While some can be machine dried, some indicate hanging to dry. For storage, place it in its original storage tube, a plastic bag, or hang.

    "combined_text": "How Marlon Wayans Trained to Get Football Fit at 53\n\n<p>To play a quarterback in the new horror film <em>Him</em>, the comedian hit the gym to pack on muscle.</p>\n\nMARLON WAYANS SPORTS a grimace as he gingerly walks into the Elite Performance Clinic , a gym in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of northern Los Angeles. A rib is jabbing his upper back, making it tough to breathe. He has an appointment with his chiropractor later, but this morning, he’s still going to train. He starts with 10 minutes in a redox room, a room-temperature chamber that fills with a mineral-infused mist that helps relieve oxidative stress. Then it’s into a spinal decompression chair for 10 minutes. Then 15 minutes of meditation. It’s the calm before a sweat storm. “Sometimes you’re going to need to sit,” says Wayans, tilting his head as a smirky smile crosses his face. “You know you can go harder after you sit.” This holistic work is new for Wayans, who at 53 might just be in the best mind-and-body shape of his life. Previously, he’d go to the gym, pick a body part, and grind. “I’m just moving,” he says. “That in itself is a win, but when you talk with somebody who knows what the fuck they’re doing, it’s different.” That somebody is his trainer, Adam Quinter , who he’s worked with for 18 months. One of Quinter’s first recommendations was to urge his client to build a meditation room in his house. He also prescribed 30-minute walks as well as the kind of workout Wayans is going to do now: a total-body circuit, six to eight exercises, three or four sets, with 30 to 60 seconds’ rest between rounds. Wayans says Quinter is helping him find balance. Not the kind of balance that makes him pump the brakes, but the kind that allows him to keep his foot on the gas without crashing, whether in the gym or onstage. “I just go,” he says. With apologies to James Brown, Wayans might be the new Hardest Working Man in Showbiz. He leaves Los Angeles most Thursdays and returns Mondays. He’s in the middle of a national stand-up comedy tour that started in February and runs through December. He’s simultaneously shooting the last season of Peacock’s Bel-Air and promoting the Jordan Peele–produced Him , in which he plays an aging GOAT quarterback. He’s also reuniting with his brothers Keenen and Shawn on a reboot of Scary Movie , the iconic horror movie spoof franchise they started in 2000. And he’s also a dad of three. “The frequency I move at on a daily basis is not human,” he says. “Sometimes I’ll go six months without a day off. I’ve always been a hard worker, but I have to learn to be a smart worker.” His smart work begins with a yoga flow that includes a toe-stretch pose, a child’s pose, a modified scorpion, and a pigeon pose. Then Wayans gets into a plank position and Quinter puts a 15-pound chain on his back. Wayans holds the plank for 60 seconds. After three rounds, he is ready to move some heavier weight. He starts this circuit pressing out pushups with the chain draped over his back. He moves to step-ups on a 20-inch box while holding 30-pound dumbbells. Then it’s back to the chain, this time draped around his neck as he muscles out pullups, screaming curses. The chain adds load and instability to Wayans’s pullups and pushups. He bangs out Romanian deadlifts and then 25-yard sled pushes that target his legs and core. Wayans hurls out a curse but leans into the grind, relishing the pain of the process. Wayans finds motivation in pain, but he says he’s learning to intertwine the physical acts of fitness more with the “spiritual act of what I’m trying to do in my career.” Working out offers a release, just like his work: After his parents’ deaths, he coped by creating a comedy special. He’s working on another special now about his oldest child, Kai, who transitioned “from being a girl to a boy,” Wayans says. “It’s about my transition—dealing with them transitioning—as a father and how I went from denial to acceptance. It’s beautiful, but the journey was painful. When you come from that place, you’re not just doing jokes. You’re healing people—in a funny way.” Wayans sips water and readies himself for the final five exercises—no time to slow down. And tomorrow? He’ll do it all again, funky rib, heavy chain, loud cursing and all. WAYANS SPENDS MORE nights in hotel rooms than in his own bed. That's why his trainer, Adam Quinter, crafted a full-body workout fitted for the basic hotel gym. Holding a dumbbell at your chest, bend your knees and drop until your thighs are parallel to the floor. Push through the heels to return to the start. 4 sets, 12 to 15 reps each set Start with your hands below your shoulders, balls of your feet on the floor. Descend until your elbows reach 90 degrees. Push back up. 4 sets, 20 reps Start in a dead hang, grasping a bar with your hands slightly wider than shoulder width. Squeeze the bar and raise your chin to it.

    "combined_text": "Everything You Need to Know About Compound Exercises\n\n<p>Your workouts will be most effective using these essential strength training movements. Here's how. </p>\n\nMOST GUYS GO about their business in the gym with one of two goals: They either want to build strength or gain muscle (or just as likely, they hope to achieve a bit of both). To achieve either of those outcomes, they can't just show up and perform random exercises assuming they'll succeed. They'll need a plan—and the best of these are built around compound exercises. Compound exercises (also known as multi-joint movements) are the big-name exercises that often serve as a short-hand for strength. Bench presses , squats , deadlifts , rows —they're all compound exercises. All of these movements require multiple muscle groups working together to complete a rep—and because of this, you'll be able to load them up with lots of weight, a major factor in building strength (and, to a lesser degree, muscle too). \"Most of the time, when done correctly, compound movements could involve the entire body,\" says Don Saladino, NASM , celebrity trainer and Men's Health Advisory Board member. \"When you look at an exercise like a squat, even though traditionally people are using this as a lower body movement, there's so many other body parts that are being involved.\" Compound exercises also provide an opportunity to build strength and size while improving how the body functions. Most of these movements echo the way that you operate in real life—think about how often you squat to sit down or hinge at the hips to pick something up off the floor. Your body rarely moves at just one joint, so it makes sense to train that way, too. Before building up a workout program, you'll benefit from learning a bit more about compound exercises and how to use them. A compound exercise is a movement that requires the activation several muscle groups through the movement of at least two joints. Take the squat , for instance. There's movement at the hips, knees, and ankles, requiring muscle activation from your glutes, hamstrings, quads, core, and more. Depending on how you load the movement, even more muscle groups can get involved. For an example of the simpler isolation exercises , Saladino offers up biceps curl . He notes that only the elbow is flexing and extending, allowing the isolation of the biceps muscle. These types of movements won't be able to be loaded as heavily, and are less efficient than compound exercises. Since compound movements harness more than one muscle group working in tandem to complete the exercise, you'll be able to load them with more weight than when you isolate one muscle. This is a reliable way to build strength as you add more load to challenge your muscles to adapt and grow in response to increased stimulus—it's the principle known as progressive overload . You'll be able to challenge your muscles more with these big movements. Compound exercises work multiple muscle groups at once, so you're able to train your whole body with fewer exercises than a routine with only isolation movements. While you may think about a deadlift as a lower body movement, as your hamstrings and glutes work to drive hip extension, your back muscles are also crucial to help to keep the load in place as you pull from the floor. During the bench press, your triceps and pectoral muscles work together, as your triceps extend your elbows and your pecs adduct to push the weight up above you. With all of these muscle groups working together, you'll also burn more calories. Overall, these exercises are \"going to give you better bang for your buck,\" says Eric Sung, C.S.C.S . Since you'll use multiple joints at once with compound movements, stability is a key to success. Small stabilization muscles will fire up to support the motion through our joints while our bigger muscles power the movement itself. Compound exercises will almost always, \"force a lot of stability,\" Saladino says. \"It's going to require more neuromuscular coordination.\" If you've ever felt winded after a set of front squats, don't mistake the need to catch your breath for being out of shape. There will be significantly more energy output when you're working through a set of a compound exercise compared an isolation exercise, according to Saladino. They carry a more intense \"cardiovascular component,\" he notes. \"When you're doing an exercise like a squat, a lunge, a deadlift, it's incredibly taxing to the nervous system.\" The central nervous system will play a big role in compound exercises, too. As you perform these big moves, you'll experience this type of fatigue—meaning that it will be important to come to them fresh. Compound movements should have a place in your routine, no matter your training frequency. \"I don't care if I'm programming up a routine that's twice a week or five days a week—I'm including some form of a compound movement in every workout,\" Saladino says. Compound movements are incredibly versatile, which makes them easy to slot them into an everyday routine. They don't always have to be loaded, either. A bodyweight squat is still just as much of a compound movement as a barbell back squat. Because of that, you can vary the load, intensity, and muscular focus of your compound exercises every time you workout. \"There's so many different ways that you can set up compound movements, to where it can be incredibly user friendly,\" says Saladino. If you do decide to dial in on a heavy compound lift, like a squat or a deadlift, complete it before you do any isolation work so that you're working on your most energy taxing exercise while you still have the most energy. For beginners, Sung suggests three to five sets of five to 12 reps, depending on the level of load—if you're going for heavy weights, keep the reps low. Not all compound exercises are for everyone. Just because a barbell back squat is one of the most commonly programmed lifts, it might not be a fit for you depending on your body and your abilities, Saladino says. Whether you have preexisting issues due to injuries, an anatomy that isn't ideal for particular movements , or restrictions due to mobility, you might find that common exercises don't work for you . The good news is there are several different ways to get your compound lifts in, like switching up the placement of the load or the equipment . If you're new to strength training, it might take you a little while to be able to build up a base for what an exercise should feel like. New lifters might not \"have the muscular endurance, or the stabilization, to be able to maintain good position,\" throughout a lift, Saladino says. Be honest with yourself about your fitness level. Tailor the reps, sets, and load accordingly. You may be used to seeing fitness influencers and athletes max out barbell squats and deadlifts, but many don't need to be doing that. \"A lot of people end up going to failure in the beginning. And they don't have that tolerance and understanding that failure is really taxing,\" Saladino says. \"It's okay in the beginning to cut yourself short a rep or two [short] so you're maximizing every repetition, and build[ing] that foundation over time.\" Many make the mistake, though, of never challenging themselves on bigger compound exercises—and that's doesn't just mean they're not lifting heavy. There are several ways to make compound movements more challenging without stacking on the plates, Sung says—like adding pause reps or slowing down the eccentric portion of an exercise. These kinds of things will get you away from your same sets and reps of the same weight, helping muscle and strength grow. WHY: There's a reason squats are one of the most touted compound exercises. The movement is powered from the hips and knees which fires up the glutes, hamstrings, quads, and core—all while depending on the back muscles to be engaged to support the load. Plus, there are plenty of variations that will allow you to put more stress on specific muscles. How to Do It: Reps and sets: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps WHY: Deadlifts are a \"really functional movement that everyone should be able to do whether it relates to picking up groceries, etc, are all daily life activities the deadlift will help with,\" Sung says. The hip hinge is important, and you'll master it here. How to Do It: Reps and sets: 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps to start WHY: The pushup is a standard bodyweight exercise that works way more than the chest. The exercise is very scalable, making is a great pick for anyone to add to their routine, Sung says. There are plenty of varieties for different points of focus, too. How to Do It: Reps and sets: 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps WHY: Master the inverted row to build back strength. Maintaining the straight body position will also require glute and core engagement. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps WHY: With unilateral movements , the \"entire body is stabilizing—you really are utilizing tension techniques throughout the whole body,\" Saladino says. Lunges are a great exercise to begin unilateral training. They can be loaded up with a variety of equipment, and engage your quads, glutes, and core. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps per leg WHY: It's a staple upper body exercise for a reason, and the bedrock of many a chest day workout. The classic bench press does more than just work the chest, however. Powering the bar up depends on the triceps, and you'll need to lock in on the bench by engaging your mid-back and core. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps to start WHY: This heavyweight row variation recruits your big back muscles to pull, but also challenges your lower body to stay in proper position as you progress through the set. Bonus: if you flip to a supinated (underhand) grip, you'll crush your biceps even more, too. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps WHY: This small piece of equipment packs a big punch. If you have an ab wheel available to you, don't be afraid to try it out. This movement encompasses pretty much all of your abdominal muscles, as well as your shoulders, glutes, and lower back muscles.

    "combined_text": "How Many Biceps Exercises You Actually Need to Build Big Arm Muscle\n\n<p>Yes, you want to build up your physique—but are you doing too much? Here's what you need to know.  </p>\n\nOur product picks are editor-tested, expert-approved. We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? FOR MOST GUYS , biceps training is pretty straightforward. Including even a single isolation exercise into a balanced strength routine once or twice a week will help you build the strength and flex appeal you're hoping to achieve. The reason: Your bis are engaged in just about every upper body pulling exercise ( chinup , pulldown , bent-over row , etc.) you do, so for most strength training goals, you don’t need to hit them with as many targeted moves as you might for a larger muscle group like your pecs or quads. But if you want to maximize your flex appeal so your arms are the focal point of your physique—even in the winter through a thick puffer jacket—you'll need more focused work. That takes a more dedicated approach like you’ll find in our Ultimate Arms Recomp training plan. That also raises an important question: What’s the ideal number of biceps-focused exercises you should include in your routines for optimum growth? We've got answers. If you’re prioritizing upper arm hypertrophy , you likely have at least one day per week when you really hammer your arms . That training session should contain three dedicated biceps moves that meet the following guidelines: An exercise that you can load maximally, such as a standing dumbbell , barbell, or EZ bar curl. The goal here is to push the limits of your strength so that you struggle to bang out your final few reps with good form. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps An exercise that changes your upper arm angle relative to your torso (e.g., a preacher curl , incline curl , or Bayesian/cable curl). That will challenge your biceps with a different “ strength curve ,” moving the most challenging point of curl from the middle to the beginning or end of the movement. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps An exercise that changes your wrist angle to emphasize your brachialis , the muscle directly beneath your biceps that’s just as important for upper arm girth and even more important for elbow flexion. The hammer curl, reverse curl , and Zottman curl are all excellent options. How to Do It: Sets and reps: 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps Performing an exercise from each of those categories will help ensure maximum muscle fiber recruitment and engagement. This approach will also inject your arm training with enough variety to avoid strength plateaus—as long as you continue to reach for heavier weights as you get stronger and switch up the exercises you perform about every two months. The short answer is: probably not. The long answer requires some context. If we expand our muscular view beyond the biceps, research shows that three targeted exercises (or about 10 total sets) is the minimum weekly recommendation for maximum growth, with the sweet spot likely closer to six exercises (or 20 total sets). So why limit yourself when it comes to your biceps? The answer is that those two-headed elbow flexors are among your body’s top workhorses, assisting other muscles as “secondary” movers in countless other exercises. Not only do your biceps kick into gear during isolation moves such as those mentioned above, but they also spring into action during just about every upper body pulling exercise you can imagine. That means every time you perform a pullup, pulldown, or row variation, you enlist your bis to help get the job done. They’re even engaged during exercises such as the deadlift and farmer’s walk to maintain grip strength and elbow joint tension and stability. That’s why performing more than three to six targeted biceps exercises a week will be overkill—even for those prioritizing arm growth. And if such growth is a priority, it’s also important not to neglect your triceps. After all, they comprise about two-thirds of your upper arms’ mass. Fortunately, the same rules apply when selecting triceps exercises. Check out our picks for the best 15 triceps exercises to round out your arm training.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? I HATE SHOPPING in person . There is no weekend activity that I dread more than having to go from store to store collecting bags, even when it’s the essentials. I’d much rather be hitting reps at the gym , running miles on the trail , doing laps in the pool , rolling on the BJJ mat, or anywhere else for that matter. For the most part, I know what I want before I buy it, either from previous experiences or by getting advice from someone whose opinion I respect. SHOP LABOR DAY FITNESS SALES ON AMAZON That is one of the reasons that I have come to rely on doing a lot of online shopping. It allows me the opportunity to pull the trigger on gear that I’ve been looking forward to trying out or needed to upgrade from previous models. That's why I always look forward to big sales events, like the ones that happen around holidays like Labor Day . I figured I'd share a few of my favorite picks from the sales available for those who hope to avoid spending more time in overcrowded malls or over-air-conditioned shopping centers. Here’s a list of gear that I’ve tested, was impressed by, and would recommend to anyone looking to level up their fitness game or preparing for marathon season. These aren't generic or unknown brands we are talking about here. These are serious offerings from tested and trusted brands like CAP Barbell , Flybird , Oura Ring , Shokz , and more. Being an editor at Men’s Health , it’s my job to know about the latest and greatest offerings, so I’ll be updating this list throughout the remainder of Labor Day. SHOP LABOR DAY FITNESS SALES ON AMAZON This weighted vest has really helped me elevate my bodyweight workouts . I've had this piece for years, and it gets used no matter the season. This vest is much more comfortable than other options than I've tried in the past. During the winter, bundled up and wearing my Wolf Tactical, I can make a lot out of a little amount of time. The open-sided design helps me stay cool during the summer months, too. Just remember you will need to purchase plates (here are the best from Wolf Tactical ) for any carrier you get, which means the savings you get here will come in handy. Sometimes simpler is better, and it doesn't get much better than this compact set of hex dumbbells from CAP Barbell. These dumbbells have all the features that I look for: knurled handles for grip, rubber ends so that you can place them on the ground without damaging your floor, and a hex design so they don't roll away when you do. Being a Fitness and Commerce Editor at Men's Health , it should come as no surprise that I've had a lot of pairs of dumbbells over the years. I especially like these, and bonus points for the convenient little rack they come with to keep them organized. There's nothing I like better than working out outdoors, getting some endorphins and a little natural vitamin D. That includes running and bicycling on the road for hours, even if it's a bit crisp outside. No matter whether you live in the city or in the suburbs, it's dangerous to be on the street with noise canceling headphones stunting your awareness. I like these Shokz OpenRun Pro 2s because I can keep listening to my training playlist while hitting the pavement. Like a lot of people, I spent a lot of my day looking at emails and data, which leaves my body idle while my brain works. Being someone who likes to stay active, no matter the circumstances, I like having training tools around my desk like this grip strengthener. This one from FitBeast is all you need, with multiple tools that can you can use to change up the habit. Grip strength is a big part of improving your upper body power. This is a great bench to pair with the CAP dumbbells, or whatever weights you have at home. It's a solid piece of gear to really increase the amount of exercises you can do. There are a lot of weight benches that out there, but many of them are pretty flimsy. Not the case with this Flybird bench, which is also pretty comfortable for those long training sessions when you're hitting chest. There are a lot of reasons I like this beautiful rower from Ergatta, which was a Men's Health Fitness Award winner pretty recently. The first thing I like about this piece of equipment is how good it looks: in the garage, in the basement, or even in the living room. Even though it appears to be a vintage piece, the cherry wood is actually quite durable. The water resistance provides one of the smoothest and most authentic rowing experiences available. The fact that you can save around $600 dollars on a model right now doesn't hurt either. There is also a great gamified digital experience available should you want it, making this a rowing machine you can look forward to using in the winter months. I have been running on NordicTrack's new T Series treadmills since they replaced the old EXP models. Sure, the brand has more premium models available, like the Commercial Series, but unless you have a good chunk of real estate for it and a few thousand dollars to burn, you may be looking for other options. These T Series treadmills are a solid option. I particularly like the T10, which has a good-sized running belt for most runners, as does the T5 version. The screen is small, but big enough for me to enjoy some sports or a series I've been watching. EZ bars are a great way to mix up your arm workouts. I have this one at home, which I picked up off of Amazon years ago and it still gets the job done. Sure, there are more expensive bars out there that are a little more refined, but for me this one all I need. The benefits to having an EZ bar? Getting to change up the grips on your curls, getting a more full workout of the bicep. I wrote about the benefits to your wrists in this story that I did about Hugh Jackman's training routine for Deadpool 3 . Yes, that's right, Wolverine uses an EZ bar too. I've never liked too much on my wrists, so in the past I haven't had much success sticking with a fitness tracker. I would wear a heart rate strap on more intense cardio sessions but that's about it. That changed when Oura Ring hit the scene, which I wrote about here . I like keeping track of my biomarkers, and being able to switch fingers keeps me from feeling too constrained. The data I collect from their app helps inform the training decisions I make throughout the week. The new Oura Ring 4 is great, but the software is just as good with this Oura Gen3, and you also get to snag the Heritage style. This particularly cool design was my favorite, but was moved away from with this latest release. These days, I've transitioned from longer runs and marathon training into a more regular and shorter running practice. Because of this I've moved away from the overly-cushioned super shoes, and into these still-super-comfortable daily trainers. These shoes were made to run in every day, and I do. The Ghost 16s have popped in our \" best shoes \" guides quite a few times, as I'm not the only editor who is a fan. This colorway is great too, bringing a little pop into the equation. If you have room for it, having a rack in your home gym is a huge upgrade. It helps you perform those fundamental lifts like squats and presses. This one from Sportsroyals is solid and is impressively multi-functional. Not only does this rack support your fundamental lifts, but it also allows you do add cable training and bodyweight exercises like dips or pull-ups your routine. I was on a cycling cardio kick until recently, when we were lucky enough to welcome our daughter Rose into the family. She recently turned a year old, and was cleared by our doctor to join me on a run in a jogging stroller. Now there is nothing I look forward to more than buckling her up in the Thule and going for a jog on the track or on some local trails. The Urban Glide lives up to its name, keeping the ride smooth no matter what terrain we are on. Be sure to select the \"single\" option when you are purchasing the stroller. I drink a lot, a lot, of water throughout the day. But when you are having the summer that we are having right now, and you like to train outdoors, it's never enough. I have enjoyed adding a Liquid I.V. to my water almost daily, usually after I've finished my run. Their citrus-based flavors are refreshing and fun. It's an easy way to level up a glass of water and keep the hydration process from getting too monotonous.

During that time, I learned great sources of protein that were plant-based, but the products from Orgain is what helped me hit my quotas. I believe this to be one of the cleanest, and the best tasting, protein powders on the market. If you're like me, you don't mind filling a closet full of protein, because it'll always be needed.

    "combined_text": "How to Use Reps in Reserve (RIR) to Build More Muscle\n\n<p>Using this approach will yield more gains than chasing a pump. </p>\n\nOLD-SCHOOL BODYBUILDERS will tell you that the most surefire way to build muscle and feel the effects of your effort is the pump . The swollen sensation that comes when your target muscles are engorged with blood is the highlight of training for many meatheads, so much so that \"chasing the pump\" is a go-to descriptor for a particular approach to workouts, filled with marathon sets to capture the feeling. Yes, you can build muscle when you chase the pump—but you're leaving gains on the table when you exhaust yourself in its pursuit. There are limitations to what you can accomplish when you're training with that objective, since you'll likely be using isolation exercises to target specific muscles rather than compound movements and lighter weights to be able to take on a high volume of reps. You won't be able to train as intensely as you need to for maximal muscle growth. There are more effective ways to build muscle and more efficient methods to go about it. Specifically, an approach often called reps in reserve (RIR). The approach is relatively simple, according to MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., who broke it down as a solution to the common mistake of chasing the pump in his Don't List video for building muscle. Using RIR in your workouts will allow you to train with the intensity needed to create stimulus for muscle growth, and the concept is exactly as the name implies: RIR refers to the amount of reps you could realistically perform (with good form) if you were to keep going after the prescribed reps were completed. Here's how to apply it: For all of the working sets of your session, challenge yourself to the point that you feel like you would only be able to complete two more reps. You're not training to failure here; that approach can be useful in specific scenarios, but you would burn out too quickly to achieve the type of muscle-building stimulus you're hoping to elicit if you fail each set. If your training plan was to perform 3 sets of 8 reps, for example, you would push to make the eighth rep hard enough that you would only be able to perform two more with good form. \"The final rep that you do is going to be slower than the earlier reps that you did, and is going to be hard and challenging,\" Samuel says. \"You might have a little bit of doubt whether you can actually complete the rep with good form.\" That struggle is what you're aiming to achieve. Samuel says that it's okay if your form wavers a bit near the end—but make sure that you don't push beyond your limits. If you find yourself finishing that final rep easily, on the other hand, that doesn't mean to push to 10 or 12 reps for every set. Instead, use that as a gauge of your effort. That's a sign to use heavier weights so that you can reach the level of intensity you're aiming to achieve. Want to know more about building real muscle?

    "combined_text": "How Many Exercises Should You Do Per Muscle Group?\n\n<p>How many moves per muscle group does your exercise plan really need? We've got answers.</p>\n\nPOP QUIZ: HOW many reps and sets should you do per exercise to build muscle? If you’re in the know, you're aware that the answer is generally three to four sets of eight to 12 reps (although recent research has shown muscle building can occur at lower rep ranges, too ). You likely also understand that load, rest period duration , and training frequency are also key variables when it comes to packing on lean mass. After all, hypertrophy (the technical term for muscle growth) is largely a numbers game, and getting the equation right can equal maximum gains in minimal time. You want to work hard, but your goal should be to work efficiently. Junk volume is a real problem you'll want to avoid—especially if you're working with limited time. With that in mind, there’s one aspect of weight room arithmetic that many guys get wrong (or at least overlook): How many exercises you should perform per muscle group to optimize your results. “More is better” is the most common approach, but research shows that there are lower and upper limits to this muscle math—and hitting the sweet spot between them is key to getting (and staying) on the hypertrophy fast track. The answer is different if your goal is strength or endurance (and more experienced lifters will be able to handle more volume), but if your primary focus is muscle growth, you should perform a minimum of three exercises per muscle group per week. Those exercises can be performed during a single workout (if you’re doing traditional split training, for example) or spread across two or three workouts (if you’re hitting your whole body each time), but the key is to perform at least three exercises per muscle group per week. (We’ll get into how to select those exercises in the next section.) This applies to the big muscle groups, like the legs and back. For smaller muscle groups like the biceps, triceps, and shoulders, where lots of exercises will be single-joint movements, you can aim for fewer sets. \"Perhaps one to two exercises,\" advises Men's Health fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., \"since the functions of those muscles are simpler.\" Also, keep in mind that the more complicated compound exercises will also involve those muscle groups, so you're training them that way, too. What’s the maximum number? That’s a good question—and one that science has yet to answer. Stacking on extra sets for each muscle group might also not be a realistic approach for regular guys with busy schedules. Who has time for that kind of targeted exercise volume except elite bodybuilders? In the real world, the consensus is that if you do between 10 and 20 sets (roughly three to six exercises) per muscle group per week, you’ll achieve the muscle-building sweet spot. Let’s start with the lower end of the spectrum, three exercises per week—a number that can be performed in a single workout or distributed across two or three training sessions, depending on your goals and schedule. Priority number one is to select an exercise that moves the targeted muscle group through maximum contraction and extension, and the associated joints through a full range of motion. If we’re talking quads, the barbell back squat is the perfect example. Next, you want to choose an exercise that varies one of the following three variables: plane of motion , angle of attack (in other words, varying the position of the exercise from the first exercise), or portion of the strength curve (where in the movement you'll be forced to exert the most force to complete the rep). Still focusing on the quads, that might mean a side squat, a leg press, or a front-loaded squat, respectively. Finally, choose a challenging bodyweight exercise . Make no mistake, unweighted moves aren’t just for beginners. In almost every instance, there’s a bodyweight exercise that can be just as challenging (or even more so) than its fully loaded counterpart. In the case of the squat, that exercise could be the pistol squat , which is performed on one leg at a time. (If you can’t perform an unassisted pistol squat, hold onto a stable pole or other supportive structure to make it easier.) Keep building your arsenal for each muscle group from there if you plan on hitting them more than once per week. The key is variation (within a structured program, of course). By consistently challenging each muscle group in multiple ways, you’ll ensure enough exercise variety in your training plan to not only maximize growth, but also to avoid plateaus.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us? ANY PERFORMANCE GEAR worth its salt is going to claim to be “moisture-wicking.” No surprise, the term shows up in all of the workout clothing brands we recommend, from Vuori to Under Armour . But while most people have a vague idea that moisture-wicking has something to do with keeping you dry in sweaty situations, the details on what puts fabric into this category are poorly defined—to the general public, at least. Moisture-wicking is more than a marketing buzzword, though. While using moisture-wicking fabric at the gym isn’t going to magically morph you into Patrick Mahomes or Lebron James, wearing gym shorts or workout shirts that fall into this category can make you more comfortable during your workouts, according to Bert Mandelbaum, MD , sports medicine specialist and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles. Moisture-wicking fabric can be a crucial element to keeping you cool and dry, allowing you to push yourself a little harder without overheating, he says. Given how much this term is thrown around, it’s easy to mentally assign a definition to moisture-wicking based on your own experience. But some gear claims to be moisture-wicking when it’s actually not, making it important to be aware of what to look for. Because you probably don’t have a degree in textile sciences if you’re reading this (we don't either), we tapped two fabric experts and Mandelbaum for help breaking down what moisture-wicking actually means, plus what to look for when sussing out gear. You probably have some idea of what moisture-wicking means, but it never hurts to get into details. “Moisture-wicking fabrics are designed to pull sweat away from your skin and spread it across the outer surface of the fabric, where it can evaporate quickly,” explains Kerry Ryan , fashion designer and adjunct associate professor of fashion design at Pratt Institute. “Instead of soaking in like a sponge, the fibers act like tiny water slides, moving moisture along and helping you stay dry.” Once that moisture is shuttled away from your skin, it keeps on moving, says Imran Islan, PhD , associate professor of textile development and marketing at Fashion Institute of Technology. “As moisture moves to the fabric’s surface, an athlete or runner faces the air, which takes away the moisture,” he says. While plenty of companies will slap this label on a range of clothes, not all fabric is truly moisture-wicking. “To enhance wicking, a fiber should have a narrow and hollow structure,” Islan says. “This narrow space differentiates surface tension, allowing moisture to be transported from one location to another.” The narrower the fiber, the better the moisture-wicking properties, according to Islan. Synthetic fibers are more likely to be moisture-wicking, but there are certain natural fibers like Merino wool that are excellent at shuttling away moisture, Islan says. Activewear and performance gear that’s actually moisture-wicking is usually made up of one or several of these fabrics: Some fibers are champs at absorbing moisture, but that’s the opposite of moisture-wicking, Ryan points out. These are fabrics you want to avoid if wicking is your goal: Your body naturally produces excess heat when you’re working out, and you have to figure out how to dissipate that heat. By wicking moisture away from your skin, you can cool down faster, Mandelbaum explains. “You can’t eliminate heat when you exercise, because you’re constantly producing it—but your body is still trying to cool off,” Mandelbaum says. “Everything you can do to allow yourself to deal with incremental heat quickly will allow you to perform better.” Moisture-wicking fabric also has the added benefit of keeping your clothes from clinging to you when you sweat, Islan says. If you sweat in something like cotton, your clothes can end up feeling heavy and less breathable, trapping heat against your skin and making it harder to regulate your body temperature, Islan explains. “In contrast, moisture-wicking can enhance performance and overall comfort for athletes or individuals in warm conditions,” he says. Moisture-wicking fabric can even reduce chafing the growth of odor-causing bacteria, helping you to feel and smell better, Ryan says. Unfortunately, your performance gear can become less effective over time. “Synthetic fabrics may lose performance due to wear, fabric softener build-up, or residue from body oils, Ryan says. “Over time, the fiber structure that moves moisture can break down.” While natural fibers like Merino wool don’t break down the same way, Ryan says they can still get clogged by residue, limiting their moisture-wicking properties. Her advice: Wash your moisture-wicking gear with a sports-specific detergent and skip fabric softener to help them perform at their best. But if you find that your go-to moisture-wicking gear doesn’t seem to be keeping you dry anymore, it’s time to swap it out for something new.

So, when a small gap in his gargantuan schedule finally surfaced, [&#8230;]\n\nSinger and songwriter Kane Brown is a man that is constantly in demand. Balancing his time between touring and promoting his music, the country music star began to feel that his fitness levels were suffering as a result of always being on the go. So, when a small gap in his gargantuan schedule finally surfaced, Brown utilized some rare downtime to start getting shredded over the summer, ahead of the next leg of his “The High Road Tour.” To discuss his journey so far, Brown sat down with M&F and acknowledged his biggest challenge to come — staying consistent on his upcoming international tour. For more than a decade, Kane Brown has been a significant part of the soundtrack to our lives. His single, ‘Heaven’ sold more than 10 million units in the U.S. and ‘What Ifs’ has been streamed more than half-a-billion times on Spotify alone. But while Brown was riding high in the charts, a nagging feeling was telling him to get back into better shape. Then, in April, the singer found himself in Canada, scrolling though his phone, when he came across a clip of UFC President Dana White discussing the benefits of fasting .With three days off from his day job ahead of him, Brown decided to try it for himself. “And, I got six other people on tour with me to do it,” the singer tells M&F. “Once I saw what happened, I really didn’t want to put anything bad back into my body,” explains the star. “I started working out and training, and then I started looking into bodybuilding.”  Brown completed his fast by only drinking water, electrolytes, and bone broth, and was encouraged by the results (those on medication or with medical conditions should consult a health professional before starting prolonged fasts). Still, working on his physique during busier times would require adaptations. “The hardest part of staying fit with my lifestyle is the traveling,” explains Brown. However, the “Backseat Driver” singer’s confidence was boosted by that initial fast, because he proved to himself that he could spend time alone in hotel rooms without the desire to graze on junk foods to pass the time. He’s been in the driving seat with his health regime ever since. The star now takes pre-prepared meals on the road where possible, so that he doesn’t give in to temptation. “I would say, for me, it’s 80% kitchen, 20% gym, but I will say that it’s all mentality, too,” he explains. Formerly a self-professed Pop-Tart fiend, the singer’s refrigerator is now clear of processed foods and high sugar options. These days, whether he’s at home or performing far away, the star also says that he’s intent on getting his steps in. Brown loves to run or walk as his preferred forms of cardio. “Get a mile, minimum,” says the ‘Miles On It’ singer. “And then when you’ve got the mile, your day is set.” Brown has even become a positive force among his peers. “My manager likes to run, my videographer likes to run,” explains the singer, noting that he loves an incline for its heart pounding, fat burning effects. The star also says that dropping weight and working on his cardio has made him better at pastimes like basketball. “I feel young again,” says the 31-year-old. “I feel like I’m 21.” Brown shares that he generally aims for around 1,900 calories per day to stay in a small deficit, allowing himself one “refeed” day where he eats around 2,200 clean calories. “It’s been four months now, straight,” he shares of his journey to becoming buff.  A post shared by Kane Brown (@kanebrown)  Brown tells M&F that he works out seven days per week, split into two days for legs, two days for chest, one day for arms, and two for back and shoulders. He still runs at least a mile and works his core every day too. “I like to concentrate on the muscle that you are working,” explains the singer, noting that he likes to feel the contraction and full stretch with every rep. “Lighter weights, higher reps,” shares Brown when discussing how he’s become so ripped. “I have a lot of stamina.” As for making smart swaps, Brown substitutes old habits like snacking on Pop-Tarts with protein shakes instead. His “cheats” include scoops of almond butter — rich in fiber, vitamins, and healthy fats that can reduce bad cholesterol and support his cardiovascular health. With three young children including a one-year-old son, the popular Country music star explains that recovery from sleep is at a premium, but he likes to relax when he finds a moment by sitting in the sunshine and soaking up some rays. While Kane Brown has been crushing his workouts, avoiding nutritional pitfalls, and getting to grips with his new fitness regime, the star understands that his biggest challenge to consistency waits in the form of the European and UK legs of his highly success successful “The High Road Tour.” While taking in Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Scotland, and England, the singer hopes to use what he’s learned and keep himself in shape despite the unpredictability of being on the road. Aside from regular workouts and taking in each city by running the streets, Brown is shunning the negative habits associated with stage performers and hopes to be in bed by midnight where possible. Of course, international tours are a great way to sample the cuisine of other cultures, so Brown is looking forward to visiting each stop, but plans to exercise portion control as a means of keeping his newly chiseled physique in check. “It’s about consistency,” acknowledges the global music phenomenon. “But then it’s about being flexible with that consistency.” To catch the Kane Brown, live, click here for ticket info.

Wait, what? Cardio and core? Before you click away, continue reading. The truth is, if you’re still training cardio and core separately, now’s the time to try combining both workouts—it can be a more efficient way to double your sweat return. Here’s where you can begin: This 15-minute bodyweight circuit blends high-intensity intervals with core-strengthening moves that not only burn calories but also build strength, coordination, and toughness. It targets your midsection through rotation, anti-rotation, and isometric tension while keeping your heart rate sky-high. All you need is your body, towels, open floor space, and 15 minutes to get after it. Whether you’re looking for a conditioning finisher or a standalone session, this one’s for you. When you combine core exercises with cardio-style intervals, you’re not just building abs; you’re also training your heart and lungs to be more efficient , rotate stronger, and resist fatigue where it matters most. This 30/30 format (30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest) balances effort and recovery while allowing you to push yourself hard. What makes this circuit effective is that each move challenges your core from different angles through rotation, anti-rotation, bracing, or balancing. You’re not just torching calories. You’re:  To maximize this workout, follow my tips below because when done well, it builds strength while burning calories. Here’s how to make every second count:  You’ll perform each exercise after a warm-up for 30 seconds, followed by 30 seconds of rest, and repeat for three total rounds. 1A. Bodyweight Woodchopper (15 seconds per side) Targets: Obliques, shoulders, glutes, coordination Tip: Let the rotation come from your hips and torso, not your arms alone. 1B. Alternating Skater Hop to Stick Targets: Glutes, quads, adductors, core, balance Tip: Focus on landing quietly and your knee aligned with your foot. 1C. Alternating Rotational Mountain Climbers Targets: Rectus Abs, obliques, hip flexors, shoulders Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked over your wrists and your hips low. Twist with intent, not momentum. 1D. Hollow Hold Flutter Kicks Targets: Lower abs, hip flexors, core stability Tip: If your lower back arches, scale by raising the legs higher or bending the knees. 1E. Push-Up to Shoulder Tap Targets: Chest, triceps, shoulders, core stability Tip: Widen your feet to stay balanced and avoid excessive torso twisting. Avoid swaying or sagging, as you should keep your hips locked in. When you’re finished, your core’s cooked, your shirt’s soaked, and your body is buzzing with endorphins. You didn’t just get a sweat, you trained rotational power, dynamic stability, and cardiovascular endurance in just 15 minutes. Then walk away from this workout knowing you’ve accomplished something efficient and effective. This circuit isn’t your typical cardio. It’s core-focused, athlete-oriented, and built for real-world strength. Use it as a finisher, a standalone session, or a quick option when time is limited but you still want results. Having limited equipment is no reason to not make limitless physique-crushing gains. When your schedule is full, a dumbbell and a few minutes is all you need to get it done.

Some lifters treat it as a free pass to load up on burgers, fries, and milkshakes in the name of “getting big.” Sure, the scale moves up fast, but so does your body fat, leaving you sluggish in the gym and staring at an extended, painful cut when it’s time to lean down. The reality is, bulking doesn’t have to be an all-you-can-eat buffet. A well-run bulking cycle is calculated, structured, and purposeful. I’m talking about adding slabs of quality muscle while keeping fat gain under control, so that when you transition out, you’re bigger, stronger, and still relatively lean.  Think of it like tuning a race car. You can’t just dump in cheap fuel and expect world-class performance. With the right balance of nutrition, training, and recovery, you can build size that lasts, strength that translates, and a physique you’ll be proud of at the end of the cycle. I’ve seen this firsthand both in the weight room and on the performance field. As a coach with a Master’s in Sports Performance, NSCA Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist (CSCS), National Sports Performance Association Certified Sports Nutrition Coach, and USAW National Coach, I’ve helped athletes and lifters of all levels bulk the right way. Whether it’s preparing an Olympic weightlifter for competition or guiding everyday athletes in the gym, the same principles hold: smart bulking builds muscle without the baggage. In the sections ahead, we’ll lay out the blueprint for bulking smarter: dialing in your calories without overdoing it, training for muscle instead of just numbers, and building the daily habits that separate the jacked from the bloated. Make this list your go-to menu to gain muscle without fat. Calories drive growth, but the quality and quantity of those calories determine if you’re building lean muscle or just adding belly fat. As a certified nutrition coach, I’ve seen lifters make the same mistake over and over again, thinking bulking means eating without limits. That might move the scale, but most of that weight comes from fat. A better approach is starting with a moderate surplus of 250–500 calories above maintenance. This keeps your body in growth mode without forcing you to diet for months on end afterward. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Find Your Surplus Sweet Spot: Track weekly weight gain. A reasonable rate is 0.25–0.5% of bodyweight per week. Faster than that, and your body is likely storing fat instead of building muscle. Coach’s Note: Eating like it’s Thanksgiving every night isn’t bulking—it’s bingeing. Smart bulking involves consuming clean foods in slightly larger quantities and adjusting your intake as your body responds. Training during a bulk is about creating the right stimulus for hypertrophy while maintaining optimal recovery. The goal is to convert extra calories into high-quality muscle with consistent, structured training. As a strength coach, I program bulking cycles differently from strength or peaking cycles. The priority is progressive overload in the hypertrophy range. This means pushing for steady increases in weight, reps, or sets each week to build muscle mass rather than test maximum strength. Here’s the framework I use with athletes: Coach’s Note: During a bulk, volume and quality are the focus. Push for consistent progress in your training and avoid sloppy lifting that can stall your results. Training and nutrition are the foundation of a bulk, but lifestyle choices decide how well your body responds. Recovery, sleep, hydration, and stress management are often the difference between gaining lean muscle and spinning your wheels. Here’s what I emphasize with athletes: Coach’s Note: Lifestyle is the glue that holds training and nutrition together. Dial in these habits, and your bulking cycle will run smoother with far better results. Not all bulks are created equal. A smart bulk builds lean mass with minimal fat gain, while a dirty bulk leaves you sluggish and forces you into a long, painful cut. Here’s the difference I highlight with lifters: Coach’s Note: A lean 10 pounds gained from a smart bulk will outperform a sloppy 20 every time. Muscle built with intention lasts, while fat only adds more work later. Bulking should never be an excuse to get sloppy. With the right balance of nutrition, structured training, and supportive lifestyle habits, you can add lean muscle that looks good and performs even better. The key is precision—eating enough to grow, training with intent, and recovering so your body can utilize the extra calories effectively. A smart bulk builds strength, confidence, and muscle mass that you’ll retain even after the cycle ends. A dirty bulk only sets you up for extra fat loss later. The difference comes down to discipline and consistency in the details. The bodybuilder is readying for the pro stage with his own brand of \"science.\" If the majority of your answers are “yes,” you’re bulking smart. If not, it’s time to tighten up your approach before small mistakes become significant setbacks. Coach’s Note: When you step into a bulking cycle, think precision, not permission. Fuel your training, recover properly, and build size you’ll be proud of when it’s time to show the results. Protein is everywhere in the grocery store, so it's time to learn what you're about to consume. Press blend on these recipes and get ready to boost your protein shake game.

With the 2025 New Delhi World Championships in his crosshairs, Mayhugh talks M&F though his training and ultimate goal of collecting more gold at the LA 2028 Summer Paralympics. “I had my first seizure when I was 14,” explains Mayhugh, reflecting on how this event would finally lead to his questions being answered. Prior to that day, he’d been an active and skilled soccer player, but had always suffered with a sense that the left side of his body wasn’t as strong as the right and didn’t react in the same way. As a growing boy, there were hopes that these feeling would rectify, but MRIs conducted after his seizure clarified his condition. At first, doctors thought that the black spot that showed up during an X-ray on this brain could be a tumor, but ultimately it was determined that Mayhugh was suffering with cerebral palsy, potentially brought on by a traumatic birth.  Having only just got started with D.C. United’s Youth Academy, doctors told Mayhugh that he should never play soccer, or any type of sports again. His family understandably felt a strong duty to protect him from the risk of physical exertion. “That next six months was the hardest of my entire life,” he shares with M&F. “It was very dark; it was very sad and depressing. I wasn’t able to go to school, I wasn’t able to play sports, so I really just locked myself in my room.” Not only did Mayhugh have to deal with the diagnosis, but he also had to get to grips with side-effects from his medication, like fatigue, dizziness, and mood swings. As his health stabilized however, the young upstart set about convincing his coaches that he could play soccer one again. “For months on end, I just walked back and forth in a straight line in my room,” he explains, in an effort to hide the limp in his left leg. “I had to change the way I played,” he adds. “I had to be more cautious and not put my head in situations that I usually would.” Mercifully, becoming active again would boost Mayhugh’s confidence, and with his family supporting him and his renewed sense of purpose, the young athlete began to blaze a trail. Firmly back behind a soccer ball and making the U.S. Para 7-a-side National Team, Mayhugh decided to take his running skills and apply them to track and field. His Paralympic debut came at the delayed Tokyo games in 2021, and he smashed it , sprinting to a 100m and 200m world record, and earning an additional gold in the mixed 4x100m relay, plus a silver in the 400m run. Mayhugh’s success would be a double-edged sword however, as officials later reclassified him to a less impaired category, moving him from T37 to T38. That move put the athlete in a more difficult class as he headed into the Paris World Championships in 2023. Still, despite the added pressure, Mayhugh was still able to take the podium with a bronze for the 100m sprint. It wasn’t gold though, and Mayhugh reveals that he found himself depressed at his perceived drop in the standings in Paris, feeling further disappointed that his classification was changed because of his earlier results. “That had kind of a negative effect on me,” he reflects, but Mayhugh also notes that this has been a time where he’s learned to put his life into perspective, appreciating the things that he has accomplished, while striving for more medals but not letting sports become the be-all and end-all of everything. “I’m in a way better place now than I was,” he shares, adding that he’s incredibly motivated for the upcoming 2025 Para Athletics Would Championships in New Delhi, India. As a keen long jumper, Mayhugh jumped his personal best with 6.19 meters during the 2024 U.S. Paralympic Trials ,  and so he will compete in both the T38 long jump and the T38 100m spring this September at those championships in India. It’s part of his plan to become the best possible athlete at the 2028 LA Paralympic Games.  A post shared by Nick Mayhugh (@nickmayhugh)  While cerebral palsy is a permanent neurological condition, “there’s a lot you can do,” explains Mayhugh, offering hope to those who also suffer. Indeed, a scientific review conducted in 2020 concluded that , “High-quality evidence indicates that resistance training can improve muscular strength in individuals with CP, with some preliminary evidence of structural and neurological adaptations.” While strength and conditioning is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and must be tailored to the individual, most experts agree that exercise provides mental and physical benefits. “Everyone’s diagnosis is different. There’s no two alike. Will I ever run as fast as Noah Lyles? Absolutely not, and that’s alright,” says Mayhugh. “But as long as I’m pushing myself and my left side to that physical capability on and off the track, and in the gym and strength training, it’s about trying to do a little more than I think I can.” The inspirational athlete says that while he cannot fix his brain damage, he can try to improve his abilities through repetition, encouraging his mind-muscle connection to fire as quickly as possible. “It’s very frustrating for someone who just wants to be perfect,” he admits, noting that he’s forced to contend with the annoyance of dropping a dumbbell from time to time, but Mayhugh has also found that resistance training is a great tool for the track. The sport’s star says that isometric exercises, where one set of muscles is used in opposition with another, like bicep curls or planks are of huge benefit. Mayhugh also undertakes a lot of unilateral work, using one arm or one leg to help with his symmetry. “I love Bulgarian split squats, that’s one thing that I do almost every day,” he shares. “Not even with weight, I’ll just try to see how long I can hold a single leg RDL, or anything that I can try — just to load my left side a little more to help with my balance.” Mayhugh has also found that receiving small physical taps on his unresponsive areas helps to activate his muscles. “One of the things that really frustrates me is I can’t feel my left glute,” he reveals. “So, when I’m in the starting blocks, and I try to push out, or when I’m striding, driving, running, those frontside mechanics, I’m trying to activate my glutes, but I can’t feel my left glute, so it’s hard for me to really use it.” To assist with activation, his coaches take a finger and tap the area in need of a response. When on his own in the gym, Mayhugh explains that he takes a finger and taps his glute, or his hamstring, or his arms during those bicep curls, and this helps with making his contractions. To further work on his balance, Mayhugh strengthens his Achillies and lower legs with calf raises. Looking straight ahead to India, Nick Mayhugh is not only proud of the progress that he’s made during his own experience with cerebral palsy but he’s also helped to raise money and awareness so that others may get the support that they need to follow in his fast footsteps. This athlete has always worn his disability as a badge of honor. Whether he’s wearing the pattern of a brain scan in his hair or posting motivational messages on social media, Mayhugh understands the power of making positive choices. “I always encourage people to just be gentle with themselves, you know?” he tells M&F. “To know that it is okay to not be okay, and that’s my biggest message. Nobody’s perfect by any means but as long as you’re doing something every day to better the situation that you’re in, then life will get better.” To follow Nick Mayhugh on Instagram, click here.

All data syncs automatically to Polar Flow— a free app. Perhaps best of all, the Loop is a one-time purchase with no hidden fees or subscription requirements. Your activity, sleep and recovery data stay yours and you can view, export or permanently delete it whenever you choose, with no paywalls or upsells. Retailing $199.99, the Loop device is available in your preferred colorway. Choose from Greige Sand, Night Black, or Brown Copper. Pre-orders for the Polar Loop are available now, with the screen-free, subscription-free wearable shipping from September 10. Visit Polar.com for info.

But what works for 25-year-old athletes doesn’t always apply to women in their 40s. In fact, traditional fasting protocols can backfire—disrupting hormones, draining energy, and stalling fat loss. That’s why Board Certified Functional Diagnostic Nutrition Practitioner Dani Conway has been teaching a smarter, more personalized method for over 18 years: fuel before you fast. As the founder of Nutrition the Natural Way , Expert Clinician Dani Conway specializes in helping women over 40 lose weight, balance hormones, and restore gut health through bioindividual nutrition, functional testing and cutting-edge protocols. Her clients include active women across Australia and the U.S. who are ready to optimize metabolism and rebalance hormones,  without sacrificing strength or sanity.  Hormone shifts—especially those related to estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, and insulin—can make a woman’s body more sensitive to stress. And fasting, by nature, is a hormetic stressor, which can be a good thing OR a bad thing! And when done without proper preparation, it can spike cortisol and trigger a cascade of negative effects: Imagine a 47-year-old woman named Claire living in Melbourne. She’s always been active—loves her weekend hikes and is meticulous about her diet. But lately, she’s been struggling with stubborn weight gain, energy crashes, and sleep that never quite feels restorative. Like many women in midlife, Claire is navigating the complex hormone shifts of perimenopause. When she attempted a popular intermittent fasting regimen, things got worse: increased irritability, cycles that were already irregular got worse, and a weight plateau in her progress. Women in midlife are already under enough internal stress from changing hormone levels. Adding poorly timed fasting—especially without metabolic prep—only compounds that hormone chaos. Dani Conway’s approach flips the script. Instead of jumping into a 16:8 or OMAD fast, she ensures her clients are metabolically ready by “fueling before fasting.” This method includes: This “fueling-before-fasting” method supports stable blood sugar, enhances lean muscle preservation, and improves metabolic flexibility—all without sending the body into a negative stress response. In Dani’s Weight Loss Accelerator Program , active women in their 40s and 50s are dropping fat, building muscle, and gaining long-term energy—without sacrificing their favorite foods or workouts. Her clients are runners, CrossFitters, yoga enthusiasts, and busy professionals who finally feel aligned with their bodies. Consider a typical midlife woman who’s been dedicated to her fitness routine but notices that things she did in the past aren’t working anymore! After years of managing belly fat and low energy, she tries the ‘fueling-before-fasting’ method and begins to notice significant changes: her energy levels stabilize, afternoon crashes disappear, and fat loss resumes without sacrificing strength or well-being. “Test, don’t guess” is one of Conway’s core mantras, and she goes above and beyond with her one on one clients. She uses functional testing – comprehensive bloodwork, hormone and gut health panels to personalize every one on one clients’ plan. This includes identifying: It’s this level of precision that sets her apart from generic fasting influencers. Her protocols are science-backed and results-driven, designed to optimize—not punish—the female metabolism. Intermittent fasting isn’t wrong—it just needs to be done differently. With the right strategy, women over 40 can tap into its fat-burning benefits without crashing their hormones. Whether you’re training for your next comp or simply want to feel strong again, the key is metabolic preparation—not starvation.  In fact, Conway’s mantra is, “STOP STARVING and start living!” Want to learn more?

Unlike other sports Halls of Fame, the ISHOF crosses over into several different sports, strength culture, and fitness. The ISHOF also recognizes athletes their members for their success in their sport as well as for their contributions, service, and philanthropic efforts to help others. Past inductees read like a Who’s Who across the world of sports, with names such as Lou Ferrigno, Randy Couture, Ronda Rousey, Kurt Angle, and Earl “The Pearl” Monroe being honored. Bodybuilding legends Ronnie Coleman, Jay Cutler, Phil Heath, and Lenda Murray have joined them as members in the ISHOF throughout the years.  The Global Advisory Board of the ISHOF has formally announced the list of inductees elected for the Class of 2025, and the six legends represent multiple sports and fitness disciplines.  A post shared by Robert Goldman (@drrobertgoldman)  The recognition of various sports legends and champions has become an annual tradition. Eight-time Figure Olympia champion Cydney Gillon joins Murray and Cory Everson as the only female Olympia champions to be inducted into the ISHOF (the ISHOF now has 58 Olympia championships across all inducted champions). She is the only bodybuilding representative in the 2025 class. Gillon ran track in college at the University of Pennsylvania before making her presence known in the sport of bodybuilding. She was also cast in Survivor: Kaôh Rōng, finishing the show and competition in fourth place. Since 2017, Gillon has been the face of the Figure division. She retired from competition in 2024 following her eighth Olympia victory but still works in the fitness industry as a show promoter, coach, and trainer. That résumé will now include Hall of Famer. Super Bowl XI MVP Fred Biletnikoff was a college standout at Florida State before playing 14 seasons for the Oakland Raiders His precision while running routes made the wide receiver a primary target. Biletnikoff was named an All Pro four times. He also spent one season in the Canadian Football League before retiring in 1980. Biletnikoff was a member of the Class of 1991 for the College Football Hall of Fame and named on The Sporting News list of 100 Greatest NFL Players in 1999. His contributions to football go beyond the field. He founded Tracey’s Place of Hope in Loomis, California, a shelter for domestic violence victims and substance abuse treatment for females ages 14 to 18. Ryan Crouser is the first three-time Olympic gold medalist in the shot put , winning those honors in 2016, 2020, and 2024. The University of Texas alum started setting records in his sport going back to his high school days. As of 2025, Crouser holds the world record for longest outdoor put with a distance of 23.56 meters and longest indoor distance with a mark of 22.82 meters. Crouser is also a Jesse Owens Award recipient and was named Track & Field News World Male Athlete of the Year. He was involved in the creation of the World Shot Put Series, which began in April 2025, helping carry the sport forward both as a competitor and advocate. Naismith Basketball Hall of Famer Nancy Lieberman is a three-time All-American from Old Dominion University and a two-time national champion. Considered by many to be one of the most important figures in women’s basketball history, “Lady Magic” was also a silver medalist in the Olympics and has two Wade Trophies to her credit. She has been a part of gold-medal winning teams for the United States in the 1975 Pan American Games and the 1979 World Championships in Seoul, South Korea. Lieberman became a part of basketball history by being the second assistant coach in the NBA when she worked on the Sacramento Kings’ bench from 2015 to 2017. She has also been a head coach in the WNBA, NBA G League, and the BIG3 League. She was the first female coach in the BIG3 to win a championship in 2018. Leigh Steinberg was the inspiration behind the iconic film “Jerry Maguire.” The sports agent, author, and philanthropist has represented over 300 athletes across multiple sports. The father of three holds the record for representing the most number one overall draft picks in the NFL with eight and represented several Hall of Fame legends. Steinberg is also revered for his philanthropy. His efforts have benefited the Human Relations Commission, Children Now, Children’s Miracle Network, Coro Fellows Program, and the Starlight Foundation. He was also the founder of Steinberg Leadership Institute (now Glass Leadership Institute), a nationwide program run by the Anti-Defamation League preparing students to fight racism and inequality throughout the world. “Superfoot” Grandmaster Bill Wallace’s name is synonymous with martial arts. He holds a 10th-degree black belt and the title of sōke (Grandmaster) in Shōrin-ryū karate. Among his accolades include being the PKA Professional World Full Contact Champion and World Middleweight Champion titles for six years. Wallace retired undefeated with a record of 23-0-0. Wallace is also the creator of “The Superfoot System,” a stretching methodology with Wallace’s kicking style and fighting approach. He has also worked as an actor in such films as “A Force of One” with Chuck Norris and “The Protector” with Jackie Chan. The induction ceremony for the Class of 2025 will take place on Saturday, Oct. 11 at the Resorts World in Las Vegas, NV as part of the 2025 Olympia Weekend . Goldman cherishes this annual event because of the people that are gathered to celebrate those being honored. Goldman had said in the past, “When you look around the room every year, you realize that it could be the last time you see them in the same place at the same time. That is a moment in time that will never happen again. That is what makes this event so special and memorable.” Details of how to attend the event have yet to be announced as of this writing. For more information, go to the ISHOF website and follow Goldman on Instagram. With Cbum gone, could Sommerfeld be the next Classic Olympia winner? The son of Quinton “Rampage” Jackson is being investigated by authorities. Vitaliy Ugolnikov will make mighty steps on bodybuilding’s biggest stage.",

Everyone seems to be waxing poetic about this macronutrient as it’s being hyped as the means to packing on more muscle and slashing hunger. Indeed, if you are focused on supporting muscle recovery and growth after hitting the gym, feeling less peckish following a meal, maintaining bones of steel, and keeping your immune system firing on all cylinders, then eating enough protein is crucial. So it’s a good thing that more people are becoming aware of their protein needs. This has left consumers on the hunt for easy ways to get more protein in their diet. And food and beverage manufacturers have taken notice. While protein bars and shakes are still out there in spades, more and more brands are adding protein to many unsuspecting foods. Protein-packed spaghetti and high-protein everything bagels. Chocolate chip cookies with as much protein as a trio of eggs. Watermelon flavored protein gels. Vanilla glazed donuts with 20 grams of protein. Fruity-tasting protein soda. Yes, we are in a golden era of protein-enhanced food. I won’t be surprised if I get a pitch sometime soon for a protein crusted frozen fish fillet or protein-enhanced carrot sticks. It’s never been easier to eat heaps of protein.  Despite all the hoopla, we need to proceed with caution when it comes to the crazy world of protein-rich, on-the-go foods. Not all foods and drinks boosted with protein are what you should be eating. Here’s what you need to know about the products beefed up with protein and how to figure out if you should go all-in. Spoiler alert: Foods that are naturally high in protein without a helping hand from food producers are still the best muscle-makers money can buy. Yes, these protein-enhanced foods make it easier to get the necessary amount of this muscle-making macro, but that doesn’t mean you have to pay up for them. As a general rule, active people who are keen on building lean body mass should aim to take in 1.6 to 2.0 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. That is 130 to 163 grams of protein for a 180 pound guy. So, yes, that is a sizable amount of protein you need to stuff in every day to hone your physique. But certainly not impossible if you make sure to eat sufficient amounts of protein-dense foods like chicken, eggs, fish, tofu, and Greek yogurt at your meals and snacks. And perhaps a scoop or two of protein powder into your shakes. If you do this, then the need for expensive protein-boosted foods is less pressing. After all, before all these products hit the market somehow we got by without suffering the perils of protein deficiency. Arnold did not have access to bread with 8g of protein in a slice. The upshot is that you should try to accurately calculate your daily protein intake and then use this information to better understand your need, or not, for foods that are jacked up with extra protein. Perhaps protein chips and steak aren’t created equal. A recent analysis of a lofty 1,641 protein bars published in the journal Scientific Reports found that the quality of protein in most bars on the market is far from ideal for building muscle. For the study, researchers analyzed the protein content, source, and nutritional quality of numerous widely available protein bars. Although 81% of the protein bars analyzed were considered high in protein from sources like whey and soy, when the protein sources were processed into bar form, digestibility typically dropped significantly. The study authors surmise that the low numbers can be attributed to the use of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibers that may deteriorate the bioaccessibility of essential amino acids. So 20 grams of protein from a bar may not be equivalent to the same amount of the macro from a hunk of chicken. Another reason to focus on eating mostly whole food sources of protein. Certainly, research like this should make us question the protein quality of certain processed foods like bars. For good reason, we have associated protein with health, but this is certainly not always the case. Just because a product as amped up their protein does not make it a nutritional hero. Never forget that protein can be just one aspect of a food. If a protein-fortified food or beverage is also laced with added artificial sweeteners, sugars, refined grains, abundant fat calories, emulsifiers, salt, and an assortment of tongue-twisting additives then you have to start questioning whether that extra protein is worth the overall nutrition cost. For instance, I’ve come across some high-protein cereals that have more grams of added sugars than grams of protein. Protein pretzels with plenty of refined grains and sodium can still be considered ultra-processed, despite giving you way more protein than your standard ballpark option. Do your due diligence and read package labels carefully to make sure all that protein doesn’t come with too much nutritional baggage. Not all foods advertised as being a protein heavyweight are true to their marketing. It’s easy to find so-called protein bars, protein granola, and protein candy that don’t deliver much more than the normal option. Protein has become a marketing term and some brands are leaning heavily on this without delivering the goods. Don’t believe the front-of-the-package hype until you determine for yourself how much protein the product has. There is no regulated amount of protein that a product has to contain before saying it is ‘high-protein’, but sage advice is that a protein-fortified food or drink should give you at least 8 to 10 grams in a serving. These protein-enhanced foods don’t sacrifice nutrition to go bigger on the muscle-sculpting macro. Nutrition (1 pouch): 340 calories, 10g fat, 49g carbs, 11g fiber, 20g protein, 240mg sodium This no-cooking-required overnight muesli-oatmeal hybrid is a nutritional giant. Each pouch of oats, which you only need to dump into a jar or bowl and soak in milk for a few hours, has an impressive 20 grams of plant-based protein and 11g of dietary fiber from sources like chia seeds. There is even some probiotics in the fold to give your gut a boost. Plus, the product is low in added sugar, letting the dried fruit carry most of the sweetness. And the chocolate flavor makes it a crave-worthy breakfast. The great balance of carbs and protein makes this a good option for post-gym recovery nutrition. Oikos Pro Plain Nutrition (3/4 cup): 160 calories, 3.5g fat, 6g carbs, 0g fiber, 25g protein, 60mg sodium The inclusion of whey protein gives this yogurt even more of the macro than most Greek versions on the market. Plus, it’s deliciously thick without including any thickening agents and delivers just the right amount of tang. The plain flavor means there are no added sugars. Unbun Protein Seeded Bread Nutrition (2 slices): 160 calories, 4.5g fat, 22g carbs, 19g fiber, 22g protein, 430mg sodium This isn’t your standard slice of doughy white sandwich bread. The bread is made with milk protein isolate and whey protein concentrate to help turn your lunch sandwiches and morning toast into a protein powerhouse. There are no refined grains or added sugar, a rarity in the commercial bread industry. And the fiber levels are off-the-charts. Just something to keep in mind if your gut isn’t used to eating high-fiber foods. If this is the case, you may want to ease into the product by starting with a single slice at a time. Felicia Red Lentil Penne Nutrition (3.5 oz): 340 calories, 1.5g fat, 65g carbs, 12g fiber, 26g protein, 0mg sodium This shaped pasta is made with organic red lentil flour instead of wheat flour giving, it a serious protein and fiber advantage. And this dynamic duo makes the noodles extra satiating. When prepared as instructed, the texture doesn’t suffer. Consider this your path to next-level pasta salad. Press blend on these recipes and get ready to boost your protein shake game. With grilling season upon us, check out this list of healthy, protein-packed BBQ meats.

    "combined_text": "German Volume Training: A Muscle-Building Method Explained\n\nGerman Volume Training, or GVT for short, has been called everything from “brutal” to “the fastest way to pack on muscle” to “a one-way ticket to DOMS city.” If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to push through a high-volume workout that leaves your muscles screaming for mercy and your shirt sleeves feeling tighter, this [&#8230;]\n\nGerman Volume Training, or GVT for short, has been called everything from “brutal” to “the fastest way to pack on muscle” to “a one-way ticket to DOMS city .” If you’ve ever wondered what it’s like to push through a high-volume workout that leaves your muscles screaming for mercy and your shirt sleeves feeling tighter, this old-school method delivers that. It started with the German Olympic weightlifting team in the 1970s. GVT became known for its simplicity: choose a big lift , perform 10 sets of 10 reps, and let the volume push your body to grow. No gimmicks, just a high volume and the grit to push through it. Here, we’ll explain exactly what GVT is, who it’s best suited for, its pros and cons, and, if you’re ready, provide a sample workout so you can see if you have what it takes to handle this physical and mental challenge.  German Volume Training was popularized in the 1970s by German national weightlifting coach Rolf Feser as a method to help lifters advance to a higher weight class during the off-season. The premise was unforgiving but straightforward—expose the muscles to an extreme amount of work in a short period to force rapid hypertrophy. In North America, strength coach Charles Poliquin brought GVT into the spotlight in the 1990s, writing about it and refining it for modern lifters. His adaptations preserved the essence of the program—high volume, controlled rest, and a laser focus on compound lifts—while making it more accessible to gym-goers outside the competitive weightlifting world. At its core, German Volume Training is about one thing—overloading your muscles with volume so they have no choice but to grow. The key number? 10 sets of 10 reps for a single big, compound movement. Here’s what makes it tick: The combination of high volume, controlled rest, and focused exercise selection creates an environment that enhances both physical strength and mental resilience. The program is best suited for: If you’re new to lifting, short on time, or still mastering the basics, this method is like trying to run a marathon before you’ve jogged a mile. Before trying any new program, even ones that have been around for over 50 years, like German Volume Training, it pays to weigh up your pros and cons, so you know if it’s right for you. GVT is excellent for a short, focused hypertrophy phase when your recovery is optimal. If you’re looking for maximum strength or are already low on sleep and stressed, a moderate-volume plan with more extended rest periods is the better choice.  If you’ve made it this far and are still eager to give GVT a try, start with this 6-week workout, which focuses on the basics. Split: 3 days per week with a full-body emphasis over the week. Main Lift: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM. Rest: Upper body: 60 to 90 seconds between sets Lower body: 90 to 120 seconds between sets Progression: When you hit all 10×10 with good form, increase the load by 2–3% the following week. Accessory Work: Keep it light, around 2–3 sets of 10–15 reps. 1. Back or Front Squat: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM, (90 to 120 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Romanian Deadlift: 3 sets, 10–12 reps @80% 1 RM 2B. Ab Rollout: 3 sets, 6-10 reps 1. Barbell Bench Press Variation: 10 sets 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Pull-Up (weighted if possible): 3 sets, 6–10 reps 2B. Stability Bent-Over Reverse Fly: 3 sets, 10–15 reps (per side) 1. Trap-Bar Bent-Over Row: 10 sets, 10 reps @ 60% 1RM (60 to 90 seconds rest between sets) 2A. Conventional or Trap Bar Deadlift: 3 sets, 6 reps 2B. Isometric Elevated Split Squat: 3 sets, 30-45 sec. per side Weeks 1–2: Focus on good form and completing all sets and reps. Weeks 3–4: Once you hit 10×10, add weight (2-5 pounds for upper-body exercises and 5-10 pounds for lower body exercises). Weeks 5–6: Push yourself to the upper end of your capacity if you meet all your reps in week four and add weight. If the increase is too much, you can decrease the weight during your working sets. Mobility and stretching on off days are crucial for staying injury-free. Wasn’t that fun? The rise of the hybrid athlete continues with this multi-faceted approach to fitness. These guidelines can make the difference in helping protect your workout partner from injury. Master this final piece to the physique puzzle and take your gains to the next level.",

The Olympia contender went on to note that while he doesn’t feel old at 31 years of age, he has noticed how his body responds to junk foods when compared to his younger days. “Not being in my 20s anymore, when I start eating like s**t, I feel it pretty f*****g hard,” revealed the 2025 New York Pro winner.  To combat his cravings, Walker now opts for healthier foods to make him feel full without the nasties. “Just give me some cream of rice, some fruit, and I’m good,” he explained. “I don’t need nothing else.”  A post shared by Nick \"the Mutant\" Walker (@nick_walker39)  In the video, Walker doubled down on his love of fruit, particularly the frozen kind. “I prefer for the majority of my fruits, except bananas sometimes, I prefer frozen fruit over fresh fruit,” he shared. When it comes to bananas, The Mutant’s reluctance to freeze them likely stems from the fact that bananas can brown, losing their structure and taste during the freezing process. Still, there’s a scientific reason that he likes to freeze the rest his fruit, and it’s not just about taste. “Studies have shown that frozen fruits are actually fresher than ‘fresh,’” said Walker. And, to a large extent, the big man is correct. Science has indeed shown that freezing fruit can have a positive effect on vitamin E content while preserving the same levels of calcium, magnesium, zinc, copper, and iron found in fresh fruits. This is because the nutritional value of ‘fresh’ fruit will very much depend on a number of factors such as when the fruit was harvested. Keep your diet on the right path by stocking your fridge with these freezable produce. Fresh fruit that is transported or stored for longer periods of time can lose its value whilst frozen fruits have their nutrients locked in during peak ripeness. The vitamin C level degrades in fresh fruit over time as well. But, that’s not to say biting into a fresh, juicy apple, or enjoying that succulent banana should be ‘cancelled.’ There’s also a faux pas that you can make with choosing frozen fruits: To get the most from your frozen fruit, avoid pre-sweetened options or ‘blends’ that may add hidden sugars and syrups to your eating regime. For Walker, however, frozen is the way to go. “I will take frozen blueberries over fresh, any day of the week,” he concluded, and was met with a ton of support in his IG comments. “I absolutely agree,” wrote one follower. “Frozen fruits are better 95% of the time.” Perhaps the likeminded fan knocked 5% off because of some badly frozen bananas? Either way, The Mutant’s current progress has him looking seriously peeled! To follow Nick Walker on Instagram, click here. The 2024 Bigman Pro Spain winner is coming strong into the 2025 Olympia.

Here’s what we know so far. Scientists searching for a more natural approach to fat loss than inconvenient injections or invasive surgery have developed a microbeads made from green tea polyphenols, vitamin E, and seaweed that binds to fats in the gastrointestinal tract, providing hope that that a scientifically sound weight loss drink such as a cup of microbead-filled-tea could turn the tide on obesity. “Losing weight can help some people prevent long-term health issues like diabetes and heart disease,” says Yue Wu, who tested the beads during an initial study involving rats, with her team at Sichuan University in China. “Our microbeads work directly in the gut to block fat absorption in a non-invasive and gentle way,” she explains . To begin the breakthrough, Wu’s team designed and constructed the plant-based microbeads as a form of “chemical tether” that binds to fat droplets and prevents them from being absorbed by the body. Apparently, the beads are almost flavorless, meaning that they could be mixed with a variety of food and drink products to limit our fat intake in the future. While this welcome invention has only been tested on rats for now, the results have been exciting to say the least. Rats tested with the microbeads had: Additionally, no side-effects were observed as a result of consuming the beads. “All the ingredients are food grade and FDA-approved, and their production can be easily scaled up,” says Yunxiang He, who is an associate professor and was a co-author on Wu’s presentation. The team behind the fat binding microbeads have announced that they’ve already begun work with a biotech company to progress larger scale manufacturing, and they have initiated human clinical trials too, meaning that this natural weight loss solution could one day hit the shelves. “This represents a major step toward clinical translation of our polyphenol-based microbeads, following our foundational results,” says Wu. “We have officially enrolled 26 participants in our investigator-initiated trial, and we anticipate that preliminary data may become available within the next year.” We’ll drink to that!  A new study has pin-pointed the effects of the popular potato option. When it comes to walking, choose quality over quantity, says science.

And, as a longtime lover of landmine rows, 2025 could potentially be AJ’s year. Issues with Andrew Jacked’s music during his 2024 Olympia performance may have caused some temporary anguish, but the big man sill managed an impressive fifth place and continues to make landmine rows part of his mass building routine, as evidenced by multiple Instagram posts documenting his approach to training. “Nothing crazy, just another workout Sunday,” he recently quipped to his 853K IG followers, as he leaned into his most recent session.  Five strength coaches share their favorite moves for making massive gains. The landmine row is a compound movement from a joint friendly angle that doesn’t overstress the lower back, instead focusing on the middle and lower trapezius in the upper back, and the teres major in the mid back, plus the lats to the side. You’ll also be pulling with the arms, so the deltoids and biceps will be taxed as well.  With progressive overload , landmine rows are a great tool for getting into the muscle building state of hypertrophy, shaping the back and building an enviable physique.  A post shared by Chinedu Obiekea Andrew J (@andrewjacked)  This man mountain can often seen performing the landmine row, and his technique is clear: Jacked doesn’t jolt the barbell as he lifts his weight skywards, instead looking for a low and controlled motion to engage time under tension. He’s also sure to maintain control of the plates on the negative, lowering the bar with the same precision as his lifts. To add landmine rows to your own muscle building arsenal , stand with your feet slightly turned out, a little more than shoulder feet apart for a brilliant base. Try to avoid rounding the back or hunching the shoulders too far forward, so that your spine remains neutral, and aim to fully extend your arms to really sink into the stretch. In his most recent video, Jacked uses drop sets for intensity, maintaining around 8 reps per set and lowering the weight until his muscles are fully exhausted. With this tireless approach to training, the rest of the Open division may need to keep a close eye on another potential upset at the 2025 Olympia event come October in Las Vegas.

Once [&#8230;]\n\nThis fall, fitness is about building complete athleticism. More lifters are proving you can chase strength in the weight room while building serious endurance on the road, bike, or rower. The hybrid athlete has arrived, and the movement shows no signs of slowing down. Hybrid training blends strength and endurance into one performance-focused system. Once thought of as conflicting goals, these qualities can be developed side by side with the right structure. The result is a body that looks powerful, performs across multiple domains, and stays resilient year-round.  The appeal goes beyond sport. Hybrid athletes aren’t training for one narrow outcome. They are developing strength, stamina, and adaptability that carry over into everything from competition to everyday life. To help you master both sides of the performance spectrum, Muscle & Fitness tapped Vincent DiPrimio, B.S. Exercise Science, CSCS, and Hybrid Performance Coach. He breaks down what hybrid training really is, why it’s blowing up right now, and how to structure your workouts this fall for maximum results. At its core, hybrid training is concurrent training: the practice of combining disciplines that don’t directly support one another. “The technical definition sometimes thrown around is ‘the concurrent training of different athletic disciplines that do not explicitly support one another, and whose disparate components are not essential to success at any one sport,’” says DiPrimio. In simpler terms, a hybrid athlete trains in two or more disciplines that don’t overlap in their adaptations. “For an easy example, compare powerlifting and ultramarathons. Both require completely different skill sets and physical qualities. The skill set needed to be good at one does not make you better at the other,” DiPrimio explains. “Yet a hybrid athlete who chooses to focus on these disciplines would work on training the qualities necessary to compete at both.” This is what separates hybrid training from more traditional fitness models. Bodybuilders chase size. Runners chase endurance. Powerlifters chase maximal strength. Hybrid athletes chase all of it; blending strength, stamina, and resilience to build the most versatile version of human performance. Hybrid training has been around for years, but its growth in recent seasons has been massive. DiPrimio points to four reasons: Variety with focus: Hybrid training offers more variety than powerlifting or bodybuilding, while still keeping attention on specific skills. Hyrox momentum: “It’s a quintessential hybrid event, where you combine strength, strength endurance, and multiple endurance modalities (running, ski erg, rower) into one event,” DiPrimio says. Hyrox has exploded globally and now serves as a showcase for hybrid athletes. CrossFit and obstacle course racing were early bridges into the space. Social media influence: Fitness creators have broadcast hybrid training to a massive audience across YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Accessibility and fun: “There are so many combinations of disciplines you could choose from across the endurance and strength worlds,” says DiPrimio. “There’s something for everyone. There’s always something to learn or improve upon, which keeps it fresh.” Hybrid training has shifted from niche to mainstream. More lifters want performance that carries across strength, speed, and endurance. This season is the perfect time to start. Hybrid athletes face a unique challenge: developing strength and endurance simultaneously without burning out. To do that, DiPrimio outlines five non-negotiable principles that guide every successful program. 1. Consolidate stressors: Pair your hardest efforts together and your easiest efforts together. For example, schedule heavy lifting sessions and sprint intervals earlier in the week, then place accessory lifts and steady-state cardio near the end. This structure allows your body to recover more effectively while still improving multiple qualities. 2. Less is more: Training for two demanding disciplines is taxing. Every exercise, set, and intensity level must earn its place in the program. “If it isn’t directly helping you improve in the disciplines you’re training for, take it out,” says DiPrimio. Focus on quality over quantity. 3. Leverage pre-fatigue: Strategic sequencing can shorten training time and trigger specific adaptations. For example, lifting for hypertrophy before a long run depletes glycogen stores. That run then doubles as a low-energy endurance session, forcing your body to adapt to running on limited fuel. 4. Attack weak links first: Break down the demands of your chosen sports and train your weakest areas with precision. Stronger athletes may need more running economy. Endurance athletes may need to raise their strength base. Identifying and addressing gaps keeps progress balanced. 5. Apply the SAID principle: Specific Adaptations to Imposed Demands (SAID) means you must train the exact qualities you want to improve. If your goals are a powerlifting meet and a marathon, your program must include heavy squats, benches, and deadlifts along with structured running sessions. Cross-training can help beginners, but the further you progress, the more specific your training needs to be. Hybrid training works when you manage fatigue as carefully as you manage the lifts and miles themselves. The body can only recover from so much stress, so programming structure becomes the key to progress. Prioritize Rest Days: Every hybrid athlete needs recovery built into the week. Advanced athletes can often handle one full rest day with an additional light active recovery day. Intermediates should take one to two full rest days. Beginners benefit from two to three full rest days. Active recovery options include walking, mobility work, yoga, or light cycling. Use Body-Part Recovery: Recovery doesn’t always mean complete rest. If you hit heavy squats and sprint intervals on Monday, you can train upper body strength on Tuesday while your legs recover. By cycling stress across different muscle groups, you keep training frequency high without overworking the same systems. Consolidate Stressors: Place your high-intensity, low-volume work, like heavy barbell lifts or intervals, earlier in the week. Then save high-volume, low-intensity sessions, like steady-state cardio or accessory hypertrophy work, for the back half of the week. This sequence maximizes recovery while targeting the right adaptations at the right time. Match Training to Adaptations: High-intensity work drives strength, power, speed, and VO₂max. Low-intensity work builds aerobic capacity, movement economy, and resilience. Each has its place, but their placement matters. Structure your week so both qualities improve without interfering with one another. The balance comes from planning. You can’t chase everything every day. Align your most strenuous efforts, give your body time to recover, and then build the base work that keeps your engine running. Here’s how to put the principles into action. This four-day hybrid program blends heavy lifting, conditioning intervals, and long steady-state work into a balanced week. It uses consolidation of stressors (hard work paired with hard work, base work paired with base work) while leaving room for recovery. 1. Box Jump: 3 sets, 5 reps 2. Barbell Back Squat: 4 sets, 5 reps (~85% 1RM, 1–2 reps in reserve) 3. Romanian Deadlift: 4 sets, 8 reps 4A. Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 3 sets, 10 reps (each leg) 4B. Deadbug: 3 sets, 10 reps (each side) 1. Dynamic Warm-Up: 10 minutes (jogging, skips, plyos, technique drills) 2. Build-Up Accelerations: 1×10 yd, 1×20 yd, 1×30 yd (walk back recovery) 3. 800m Repeats : 6 reps at ~5% faster than race pace, 1:1 work-to-rest ratio 1. Plyo Push-Up : 3 sets, 5 reps 2. Bench Press: 4 sets, 5 reps (~85% 1RM, 1–2 reps in reserve) 3. One-Arm Dumbbell Row: 4 sets, 8 reps (each side) 4A. Weighted Chin-Up: 4 sets, 8 reps 4B. Kettlebell Overhead Reverse Crunch : 4 sets, 8 reps Options: easy walk, light cycling, yoga, or complete rest. 1. Broad Jump: 3 sets, 2 reps 2. Deadlift: 4 sets, 3 reps(~90% 1RM, 1 rep in reserve) 3A. Seated Barbell Overhead Press: 3 sets, 12 reps 3B. Dumbbell Walking Lunge: 3 sets, 12 reps (each leg) 4A. Chest-Supported Dumbbell Row: 3 sets, 12 reps 4B. Barbell Hip Thrust: 3 sets, 15 reps 4C. Half-Kneeling Cable Chop: 3 sets, 8 reps 1. Dynamic Warm-Up: 10 minutes (jogging, skips, plyos, technique drills) 2. Tempo Run: 30 minutes at race pace Friday: Rest or Active Recovery Options : mobility, Zone 1 cycling, or full rest. Saturday: Long Steady-State (LSD) Run 1. Dynamic Warm-Up: 10 minutes (jogging, skips, plyos, technique drills) 2. Steady-State Run: 60 minutes at Zone 2 pace (conversational effort) Sunday: Rest Take a full rest to reset for the upcoming week. Monday/Tuesday pairs heavy lifting with intervals to drive strength and high-intensity adaptations. Thursday/Saturday balance hypertrophy and long aerobic conditioning for volume and movement economy. Recovery days ensure your nervous system, muscles, and joints reset. DiPrimio emphasizes that the key to hybrid training is sustainability. Each workout serves a purpose, every rest day is earned, and the structure allows you to train hard without breaking down. It’s time for a refresher course on this old-school size-gaining method. These guidelines can make the difference in helping protect your workout partner from injury. Master this final piece to the physique puzzle and take your gains to the next level.",

If we take a KitKat bar and blend it with milk to make a KitKat shake, does that make it any healthier compared to just eating the KitKat on its own?\n\nMilk adds some protein and calcium, but at the same time it probably adds more calories. Curious to know if there’s actually any nutritional benefit, or if it’s basically the same (or even worse) as just eating the chocolate."

(Because the building calories aren’t currently being used for energy but are stored)\n\nHere’s the scenario: You have a maintenance of 2000 calories, you ingest 800 calories of protein bringing your daily net total to -1200 instead of -2000. The amino acids in the protein will be used for various things that aren’t providing energy for the body. Just for the sake of the exercise let’s say 50% energy 50% building. That would mean 400 calories are stored as your body builds itself up, and aren’t being currently used as energy.\n\nNow here is my question: Am I right in thinking that your body needs to now find an “additional” 400 calories to fuel itself? I agree calories in calories out in terms of total weight, but if you were trying to keep muscle mass but cut fat (if my way of thinking is even true) wouldn’t it be important to look at things in terms of what calories are being used to build and what calories are being used for energy instead of just total energy from all sources?\n\nSorry if this post comes across as naive but I just want to learn if I am missing some key information in how the body uses its energy from fat and protein\n\nThank you!"

Rye flour contains high levels of phytase that will be activated during the soaking process. ... Even without the rye flour, overnight soaking of oats and other low-phytase grains greatly improves digestibility but won’t eliminate too much phytic acid. ... You can keep whole rye grains and grind a small amount in a mini grinder for adding to these grains during the soaking process.\" (https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/vegetarianism-and-plant-foods/living-with-phytic-acid)\n\nIs it safe to consume raw cracked rye if it's been soaked for, say, 12-15 hours.

It was eye-opening to discover that factors like digestive health, food combinations, stress levels, and even medical history can greatly influence how the body processes and utilizes nutrients.\n\nOne concrete example I experienced was with protein intake. After making a few diet adjustments recommended by them, my digestion and muscle recovery improved noticeably, even though the total amount of protein stayed the same. The difference came from how I combined the foods and the timing of when I consumed them.\n\nI think it's worth paying more attention not just to what we eat, but also to how and how well the body uses it."

As an example, I have Thrive Market dried red lentils, which have 100 calories, 9g protein, and 8g fiber per serving. That's 1g protein per every ~11 calories. But then a bag of Goya dried red lentils is 160 calories, 11g protein, 5g fiber. Lower fiber and 1g of protein per every ~14 calories. \n\nNot just lentils either. I have Iberia red kidney beans, which are 70 calories, 9g protein, 14g fiber per serving (1g protein per 8 calories). Goya's label for the same beans says 140 calories, 9g protein, 6g fiber (1g protein per 16 calories). Way less protein and fiber than Iberia. \n\nAnd this is across so many other brands too, different for every brand, different for canned vs. dried. What's the deal??\n\nI'd like to point out that I know the serving sizes vary across each product, but that doesn't explain why the calorie to protein and calorie to fiber ratio is so different."

However questions arise on:\n\n1. How beneficial is this in improving SPI protein quality for muscle synthesis. The product adds 3g of leucine and this supposedly improve the amino acid profile of SPI. The logic seems to add up but I am curious if this makes a good source compare to whey protein WPC/WPI.\n\n2. Whether in food industry it is acceptable to not call this as \"amino spiking\" that is synonymous with scamming protein amount per serving due to higher nitrogen content. \n\nIf the product is transparent of its purpose but uses protein content per serving without deducting the added leucine; is it considered amino spiking? Is all \"amino spiking\" bad? Should the company revise their labels, marketing and change the protein content advertised? \n\nI am more inclined to say it's okay but perhaps people from the nutrition field can describe it better or have specific opinions.\n\nThis is not a post seeking professional medical advice."

The idea was to try to figure out which foods gave people the most sustained feeling of satiety per calorie, and their study included 38 common foods. I find the recommendations personally useful but, since the original list is pretty limited, it’s surprising that it doesn’t seem like their methodology for finding satiety indices has ever been extended to more foods nor have I seen replications. This seems like a really useful tool for weight loss, and the methodology makes it sound pretty simple to perform. It also had some counter-intuitive results like boiled potatoes being by far most satiating foods despite a lot of modern diet advice focusing on protein and fiber for fullness, which I think would be worth exploring further.\n\nIs there a reason nothing else was done with the satiety index concept or are there other more recent papers I’m missing?"

A weeks worth of groceries for myself can easily be $100, and while im trying to do some cost saving measures by buying in bulk at costco and freezing, it still doesnt help the over all problem.\n\nCommon internet wisdome is a gram of protien per pound of your goal weight. But 210g of protien per day is crazy! Three meals a day, thats 70g of protein per meal! Even if I could stretch it 5 smaller meals, that's still 42.5g. And everything thats high in protien is high and cost, and often high in sugar and everything else you dont want. I dont know what to do, and I could really use some help."

    "combined_text": "Title: simple guide for protein intake for recovery and muscle growth\n\nPost: You’ll be familiar with the wellness industry’s insistence on overcomplicating everything (usually for profit's sake).\n\nProtein guidance for recovery and muscle growth is an obvious example.\n\nSelf-proclaimed experts will try and push obscure ‘research’ to encourage you to buy their product or cause controversy on social media.\n\nThis post is all about the clear guidance you need to utilise protein to fuel your recovery and muscle growth.\n\n# Total Daily Protein is the Absolute Priority\n\nThe single most crucial factor for maximising muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and achieving muscle growth is the **overall amount of protein consumed throughout the entire day**. This concept is likened to a \"cake,\" with specific timing of protein intake being merely \"a very thin layer of icing\" on that cake.\n\nThere’s a clear hierarchy where meeting your total daily protein needs takes precedence over everything else. This means that even if protein intake is not perfectly distributed across meals, for instance, a smaller amount in the morning and a much larger, protein-rich dinner, the body can still effectively utilise that protein for muscle building, provided the daily total is met. Don’t think you need to front-load 50% of your protein requirement immediately after your workout.\n\n# Optimal Daily Protein Intake for Muscle Building\n\nFor most individuals aiming to build muscle through resistance training, the recommended total daily protein intake is approximately **1.6 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight**, which translates to about **0.7 grams per pound of body weight**. Some recommendations suggest going up to 2 grams per kilogram, or roughly 1 gram per pound, but these don’t factor in lean muscle mass, so are likely higher than necessary. A meta-analysis of existing literature concluded that as long as total daily protein intake was at or above this range, **the specific timing of protein consumption relative to a workout did not significantly impact muscle gain**.\n\n# The \"Anabolic Window\" is Very Flexible\n\nThe traditional notion of a narrow \"anabolic window,\" which suggested consuming protein and fast-digesting carbohydrates within 30 to 60 minutes post-exercise, largely originated from studies where subjects trained in a completely fasted state. However, this concept has limited relevance for most people who consume meals before their workouts. When a mixed meal is eaten pre-exercise, its anabolic and anti-catabolic effects can last anywhere from three to six hours, meaning that **nutrients are often still circulating in the bloodstream during and even after a training session**.\n\nA comprehensive meta-analysis found that if the total daily protein intake is sufficient, the **exact timing of protein relative to the training session makes no meaningful difference** for muscle gain. Furthermore, the actual physiological \"anabolic window\" for muscle protein synthesis is much broader than just a few hours; it **peaks approximately 24 hours after resistance training and remains elevated for as long as 48 to 72 hours**. This indicates that the body has an extended period to utilise available nutrients for muscle repair and growth.\n\n# Meal Timing and Protein Portion Sizes\n\nResearch demonstrates considerable flexibility in when and how much protein one consumes per meal. A study showed **no significant advantage** between consuming protein immediately before exercise versus immediately after. Building on this, another trial specifically examined what happens when individuals neglect all nutrients for three hours both before and after a resistance training bout, while still optimising total daily protein. The results showed **no significant or meaningful difference in muscle size and strength gains** compared to a group that consumed protein immediately around their workout. This means there is **tremendous flexibility** in fitting protein intake into a busy schedule. While studies suggest that doses of around **30 to 50 grams per meal (or 0.4 to 0.6 grams per kilogram of body weight / 0.2 to 0.25 grams per pound of body weight)** appear to maximize muscle protein synthesis *per meal*, the body is also perfectly capable of effectively utilizing much larger protein amounts, such as **75 to 100 grams, from a single meal** for muscle protein synthesis. This is particularly helpful for individuals who find it more practical to consume a significant portion of their daily protein in one or two larger meals, such as dinner.\n\n# Nutrient Availability Trumps Ingestion Time\n\nThe crucial element for muscle protein synthesis is the **presence of nutrients in circulation**, not the precise moment those nutrients are ingested relative to your workout. Nutrients typically **peak in the bloodstream one to two hours after consumption**. Therefore, if you eat protein before a workout, those amino acids will become available in your system during or shortly after your training, ready for use by your muscles. This clarifies why a rush for immediate post-workout protein is often unnecessary, especially if a pre-workout meal has been consumed.\n\n\\---\n\nTaken from r / healthchallenges"

But then someone else will say that red meat is awful for you and will give you cancer, and say you should ACTUALLY be eating a ton of rice and lentils and beans. But then another person jumps into the convo and is like, “No! Rice is bad because too many carbs! Don’t eat rice!!” And then somebody else pops in like “You need to just eat a bunch of vegetables.” And then another person says “Noooo a lot of vegetables, like potatoes and tomatoes, are actually bad for you.” \n\nSo basically what I am hearing is that every single diet is simultaneously the best thing you can eat and also the worst thing you can eat, just depending on who you ask, because everyone always thinks they’re right. As someone who is trying to eat better and more nutritiously, what should I ACTUALLY be eating? Please help, I cannot stand the misinformation anymore 😭"

They're a good, convenient source of fruit fiber, but I noticed something odd about them. The nutrition facts lists 0g fat, 0g protein, and 7g carbs. subtracting the 2g of fiber, thats 5 carbs total, all from sugar. using the recognized 4 cal/g number for carbs, the total calories should be only 20, but the packaging lists it as 35. While a negligible difference numerically, it's a huge difference percentage wise, so it got me thinking: is the 4 cal/g number really that consistent?\n\nI've always had this game theory in the back of my head, that because different types of carbs break down differently, it stands to reason that carbs from sugar (such as fruit) would have a lower thermal effect than more resistant starches (think potatoes), and thus would be worth more calories per gram. If this were the case, the cal/g of fruit sugar would work out to 7. I've never seen this brought up anywhere else, but it's possible I just haven't looked hard enough\n\nI'd love to know what y'all have to say on this matter"

Today I weighed 180 g of raw beef tenderloin from the butcher, since there was no nutrition info on packaging. I checked online and found that 180 g raw should have around 40 g of protein. After cooking, I weighed it again and it was only 80 g. A quick search showed that 80 g cooked meat has about 20 g of protein. But usually meat loses only around 25 % of its weight while cooking, so the macros from the raw meat should still apply afterward. So I logged just 20 g of protein today. Did I do this right? It seems strange the raw meat must've had extra weight, or maybe I made a mistake. What’s the best way to handle this in the future?"

And its a common misconception that you body will be able to pass all of the excess. \n\nAre there are supplements on the market that are tablets and are just pure collagen? Does anyone else see this? Or have I completely misunderstood and you would need and use that extra vitamins C to process the collegen on top of what other vitamin C you might consume? \n\n(I also know that vitamin toxicity is rare but it's nasty and in some cases irriversable)"

(I will never feed a cat a vegan diet.) I know cat's are carnivores, BUT are there any amino acids a cat needs that cannot be consumed from non-plant sources if a human wanted to spend the time and energy to feed their cat it. Again, this is for an arguement two non-cat owners are having, its not for practical purposes, just about who is right in an arguement. It is not an arguement about what one should be feeding their cat. More about the definition of what a carnivore is.\n\n3.5) If there are amino acids non-animals cannot produce that an animal needs\n\n\\- A carnivore is an animal that needs to eat meat because it cannot get the amino acids it needs from anywhere else.\n\nIf non-animals can create every amino acid an animal needs\n\n\\- A carniore is an animal that eats significantly more meat based calories than non meat based calories\n\nI think?"

They just did not get enough calories in the preceding 1-2 days, and as a result they got hungry / had high cortisol and woke up too early.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the replies. Many people said \"eat more during the day to prevent this\". Sure, that is good advice. The point of this post is for when dieters are already in this situation, for any reason (exercised more than usual and did not increase calories enough to compensate, burned dinner, overestimated their calorie intake that day, etc.). Also, \"just go back to sleep\" is not helpful when it can take more than 1 hour to do that, if it is even possible."

I'm interested in being able to make a base powder and add additional flavorings because I don't have $50 to drop on 1 container of Ghost Oreo when there's only a handful of different ingredients. I'm looking into using milk protein concentrate as a base, and I've identified additional ingredients to add such as peanut powder, cocoa powder, ground flax/hemp, date powder, and I'm toying with the idea of freeze dried fruits for some of the fruity flavors. Does anyone have experience in this area or have a base powder recipe they'd be willing to share? Everything I've come across so far is saying to heat and grind almonds or oats and use like 1/2 cup or 63g for smoothies."

From the introductory paragraph:\n\n>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume “1.6-2.2g/kg” [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don’t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you’ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume – it certainly won’t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn’t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.\n\nThis article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition."

    "combined_text": "Title: A rundown of things that basically cured my severe anxiety/OCD/anhedonia\n\nPost: I lived with 24/7 nonstop fight or flight from ptsd and other issues for years, dissociative symptoms and OCD symptoms due to extreme anxiety that would not go away no matter what I did. Ssri and buspirone did absolutely nothing. I also couldn't experience joy or most emotions.\n\nI started researching supplements and after about 6 months of careful trials of different supplements, this is what is working really well for me right now. My mind feels so much better now and my life is genuinely enjoyable again for the first time in like 15 years!\n\n\nSupplements I take every day:\n\n*** NAC ***\n\n-has a long list of health benefits for everyone to take and no known risks to take it long term. For anxiety, it can help balance glutamate levels, and has been studied clinically as a treatment for OCD, anxiety and several other mental health issues. I saw a HUGE improvement after being patient through an adjustment period of maybe 4 days (I took it at bedtime so I could sleep through the adjustment symptoms; not everyone has these symptoms but it basically just made me feel a bit \"icky,\" and Ive read that this can happen because it is basically doing a detox at first). Since then, I feel so much better every day after I take it. I started at 600mg of extended release (Jarrow makes one called NAC Sustain- this extended release makes it gentler than absorbing all of it at once and I take it religiously now), and am increasing it to 1200mg daily (one around 8am and one around 3pm) because 1200 is closer to the recommended therapeutic range for mental health. So far so good!\n\n*** Methylated B-Complex or Methylated Multi with the complete spectrum of Methylated B Vitamins ***\n\n- I'm taking Pure Encapsulations O.N.E and felt AMAZING mood and energy lift with my first dose. A lot of people have issues with methylation and I highly suggest getting a fully Methylated multi to see if you can feel a difference. If your system has methylation issues, it can cause a whole slew of mental and physical health symptoms due to it causing various deficiencies.\n\nI really like O.N.E because it also has *inositol* which is a great supplement for anxiety too, as well as a decent dose of CoQ10 which can also help! It honestly has a whole bunch of useful supplements included. If you look for it on Amazon it might look like the $45 option is the main price, but the 30 pill container is only $23, you just have to click the listing to see that one as an option.\n\n*** PEA (Palmitoylethanolamide) ***\n\nThis one has been a complete game changer for me. When I feel overwhelmed, anxious or stressed (or OCD) I start fixating on all my body aches and discomfort. PEA basically erases all of those aches and feelings of discomfort. It has been studied for things like fibromyalgia, nerve pain, anxiety/ocd/depression, autism related sensory issues, brain fog and neuroinflammation, and I absolutely love it. I dont necessarily \"feel\" anything when I take it (which is good), but i feel very obviously achey and generally uncomfortable when I dont take it. \n\nI'm taking Nootropics Depot PEA, one before bed every night and one around 8 or 9am every morning (I wake up around 6 most mornings).\n\n*** multi-strain probiotic complex *** \n\na lot of mood and mental health stuff can be supported with probiotics since the gut has a \"brain\" in it\n\nI'm taking a brand called OMOGS Women's Probiotic, but it's a cheap brand and I'm going to look for an extremely well rounded brand when I run out of these. \n\nI'm also taking Jarrow S. Boulardii, and until recently was taking Akkermansia. I intend to keep all of these in my daily routine, and it has made a huge difference in my digestion which has helped me feel less uncomfortable and therefore reduced anxiety, but also there are many mental and mood conditions that are caused by bad gut health \n\n*** A good quality L Theanine ***\n\nI'm taking Life Extension Theanine XR Stress Relief, which is an extended release L Theanine. I like it so far. I've also bought mints with L Theanine in them and liked that too. L Theanine is good as a daily supplement or as-needed. The mints seemed to make me a little bit on the drowsy side, but the extended release one is working great as a daily supplement and I love it. \n\n*** Good quality Magnesium Complex (with Magnesium L threonate) ***\n\nSome complexes come with magnesium malate and/or magnesium taurate in it. I change up the brand from time to time but always make sure L Threonate is in it. These are usually 3 pills in a 200mg serving, and I take the 3 pills split up throughout the day to keep from getting drowsy, but I can take 2 at once just fine if I'm not sleep deprived. Days when I miss the magnesium always tend to be more painful, uncomfortable, moody and stressful. If I take it late, I can feel a huge difference when it kicks in!! \n\nIve tried 3 brands so far (from Amazon):\n\nMagTech (with taurate, and my favorite brand so far)\nMagEnhance (with taurate)\nAmandean Magnesium Complex (with malate)- currently taking this one and I have been feeling really mentally good lately so it might be better than MagTech but seems more subtle\n\n*** Magnesium Bisglycinate at bed time ***\n\nI take this religiously at bedtime. Sometimes 100mg and sometimes 200mg depending on how much sleep aid I feel I need. It makes me a bit too drowsy during the day but makes a HUGE difference in my sleep quality and I dont feel as relaxed without it at night and wake up a lot more without it. It is the only sleep aid ive ever tried that doesnt make me sleepy the next day or want to sleep through my alarms. \n\nMy go-to brand of bisglycinate is NutraBio\n\n!!Magnesium citrate and oxide can give you sudden, explosive diarrhea so I would avoid those.\n\n*** 1 mg liquid melatonin ***\n\nI dont like how melatonin makes me feel, but if i take .5mg - 1mg of liquid melatonin along with my magnesium at night, they work really well together without feeling too strong. Also, it helps prevent night time reflux!\n\n*** D3/K2 ***\nI had a slight D deficiency, and found out you need to take it with K2 and Magnesium for absorption/balance.\n\nI take 4000iu D3 (with K2) a day. I started out taking Nordic Naturals, which I liked. Recently I'm trying Thorne liquid drops, and I add the drops to a bottle of water every morning and sip it somewhat slowly and feel a noticeable boost from that!\n\nAS NEEDED supplements:\n\n*** GABA (not gabapentin) ***\n\n is an EXCELLENT go-to for extreme anxiety and stress, if you are okay with possibly feeling a little sedated. I would typically wait until like 2 or 3 hours before my work shift ends, when my brain is fried and im already going to be suffering the rest of the shift anyway if I dont take something, and the slight sedation isnt too much to be able to still do my job and it really does help.\n\n*** L Theanine *** \nUseful as-needed for high stress but more subtle than GABA\n\n*** Mushroom Complex ***\n\nI have been taking a Transparent Labs Mushroom Stack combo that has Lion's Mane, Cordycep and Reishi. Before I reduced my SSRI, it was too stimulating for me to take it unless i was really draggy and fatigued. On fatigue days, i use it as a pick me up so i dont have to rely on caffeine\n\n*** Ginseng ***\n\nSame as the mushrooms, it's stimulating so if my anxiety is high i avoid it, but if i need a caffeine type boost i take this and it works pretty well without the caffeine downsides\n\nUseful supplement but I stopped taking it because I am feeling better and dont need it now:\n\n*** Shoden Ashwaganda ***\nAt first i took this as-needed but felt a bit wonky when I would take it. Eventually I started taking it daily (usually in the late afternoon when stress from the day had built up) and after a while it felt really stabilizing to take every day. But I stopped because things like NAC, methylated vitamins and a couple OTC meds had balanced me enough I dont need it anymore \n\nNootropics Depot makes a Shoden Ashwaganda that is affordable and I liked that one.\nMood Mingle also makes one, but it has B vitamins and i didnt want to take non methylated B vitamins.\n\n- also I want to suggest sticking with the Shoden type. Other types might be worth trying (and might even work better for you)! But Shoden was the only one I personally have enough experience with to recommend\n\nOTC meds that helped me enough to mention:\n\n\n*** H1 allergy meds ***\nMy anxiety has turned out to be linked to a histamine imbalance in my body, and if you have any allergies or regular sinus symptoms like sneezing, runny nose etc, I highly recommend trying Claritin and Nasacort to see if it cuts down on your anxiety symptoms. Sounds weird, but histamine overload can cause anxiety! I notice an enormous difference when I take H1 histamine blockers (claritin, allegra - both non-drowsy, zyrtec can be drowsy for some people, but more on that later) and Nasacort.\n\n*** Pepcid (H2 histamine blockers) ***\n\n if by any chance you might have similar anxiety triggers to mine, Pepcid is an H2 histamine blocker that works in the digestive system. If you ever have heartburn, I strongly suggest avoiding things like Tums and switching to Pepcid (test out the strength that seems to make a difference for you). It also really makes a difference in my mood and ability to relax.\n\nPrescriptions that are not typical anxiety meds that have been game changers:\n\n*** Ubrelvy or another gepant ***\n\nThis one was a complete accident discovery. It is a migraine med, if you have headaches just ask your doctor about it. Whenever I take a Ubrelvy, I can be having the worst OCD meltdown ever and Ubrelvy just FIXES it like magic somehow!! I did some digging and found out it also helps glutamate similar to NAC. As far as I know it is not researched for anxiety, but I can say that for me it is a lifeline. I asked for a prescription for Nurtec or Qulipta because Ubrelvy is an as-needed gepant, but those other two are daily meds. \n\n\nEven though it’s not approved for anxiety, it:\n\nReduces neuroinflammation.\nCGRP is tied to stress signaling.\nHelps prevent overstimulation.\nMight improve dopamine availability, especially if CGRP is disrupting reward/motivation circuits\n\n\nSome researchers even argue that CGRP antagonists should be explored for depression or anxiety actually!\n\nTied to the glutamate thing is the histamine issue:\n\n\nWhen histamine is high, it tends to push serotonin up (through indirect pathways).\n\nIf serotonin gets too high, especially in certain brain regions, it can flatten dopamine and increase obsessive thoughts or anxiety. It can cause numb emotions, anhedonia, obsessive spiraling, etc\n\nMost anxiety meds raise serotonin. I was cracked out when I was taking Lexapro because they just kept raising my dose when it didnt work. I got switched to Wellbutrin that only works on dopamine and norepinephrine, and reduced my lexapro, and it magically reduced my anxiety and racing thoughts by at least half. \n\nI also found out I have ADHD (i got medicated for that before I tried all the other stuff) and from my experience, guanfacine is way more effective at reducing overwhelm- induced anxiety than my stimulant (vyvanse). I consider guanfacine a necessity for me too for anxiety. A lot of doctors seem to only give it to kids but id rather give up stimulants than let guanfacine out of my rotation.\n\nThese meds are very useful but without the supplements and OTC meds I mentioned above, id still be a scattered nervous wreck who can barely function, always feels like something is wrong and is miserable every waking hour.\n\nI'm adding this note about Zyrtec:\n\nI accidentally tried Zyrtec one day when I meant to take Claritin. Not everyone has drowsiness from Zyrtec, but I do. But it isnt like benadryl, it's actually kind of like a pleasant mild sedation that takes the edge off. I cant overthink even if I tried with the Zyrtec. I just feel really chilled out, like when youre slightly intoxicated, but it's safe to take every day if needed. I will probably start using this as a go-to for extreme situations when being drowsy is safe and I just need an emergency chill pill. I definitely am going to trial it for my night regimen to see if it helps with sleep and maybe (crossing my fingers) the anti-anxiety effect will be a bit tamer the next day when I wake up but still taking that edge off, because I really like it!!\n\nThings I'm trialing at the moment, tbd if they will stay:\n\n*** Nordic Naturals Memory Support ***\n\nI think i might have gotten the last bottle of this in existence but in case it ever comes back into stock:\n\nI wanted a well rounded omega complex, and this one has your basic EPA and DHA, not as complete as I really wanted. BUT it does also have phosphatidylserine (PS) which i was dying to try it (it's used for anxiety, brain fog and even ADHD treatment), and also has curcumin and Huperzine A. Ive been leery of the Huperzine A causing too much energy but it's going okay as long as I take it like 11am or so. I feel like the first time i took it close to bed, my brain was too alert. Definitely no brain fog!! Lol\n\n*** quercetin phytosome (with luteolin) ***\n\nJust got this one today for neurological support and I'm so excited to try it!!\n\nI also have come and gone with taking a daily amino acid complex, creatine, protein powder isolate and green banana powder which help me feel good but I always forget because I have to mix them as a shake and I unfortunately get lazy lol\n\nFor my histamine sensitivity i take a DAO supplement which also ties into my anxiety \n\nMy boyfriend thinks Im overmedicated because he wont even take tylenol when he has severe pain, but i feel like a functional person for the first time in a decade so....no ragerts :)"

Don't fall for it.\n\nPost: I saw a story online with The Rock looking slim and muscular, he lost 60 pounds of muscle,a and a story came out that it was due to gut issues which are probably true, a lot of people who are healthy and workout are developing inflammatory bowel diseases. One theory is the supplement protein, amino, creatine powers with additives possibly irritating the gut slowly but surely and taken long term causing full blown inflammation. I know this is what MMA figher GSP said, he gut Ulcerative Colitis and was bulking up taking three protein powder shakes creatines, aminos daily. He just did fasting and clean dieting removing all ultra-processed foods, junks, etc.\n\nThe Rock on the other hand if I were to guess is invested in a new Gut health line, that will drop soon. He probably partnered up with the doctor Mark Hyman who supposedly cured him.\n\nIn their interview the Doctor just said he gave a him a concoction of stuff, he doesn't give the exact protocol because he will probably drop the supplement Gut Cure later on. If he really did heal his gut why not just drop the meal plan, and supplements used?\n\nThis why I say be careful of Celebrity endorsements or of them curing themselves naturally, its mostly marketing gimmick to sucker the consumer, usually its geared toward women they tend to buy these fad diets and cures up like candy. My Mom and Aunt would fall sucker to those infomercials in the 90s of slimming down pills and stuff.\n\n  \nHere is a snippet:\n\n“That was at the beginning of 2024, and I was just getting ready to launch into what would become a nine-month workload for me — nonstop work,” Johnson said. “And I was thinking, ‘Holy s–t, how am I going to get through this with my gut issues? I’m not digesting properly.’”\n\nLuckily, Hyman was able to provide Johnson some relief, finding the issue began after he took multiple rounds of antibiotics, which messed with the bacteria in his gut. He was missing Akkermansia, which coats the lining of the intestine and protects from inflammation and a leaky gut, Hyman said.\n\n“We basically rehabbed your gut. Gave you probiotics and plant compounds—pomegranate, green tea, cranberry — to help rebuild it,” Hyman said. “And we made you this amazing gut health shake with 10-plus ingredients personalized for you.”\n\n[https://nypost.com/2025/06/12/sports/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-reveals-frustrating-gut-health-issue/](https://nypost.com/2025/06/12/sports/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-reveals-frustrating-gut-health-issue/)"

I've also been sober and focusing really intensely on my career without a break so the edge was rather sharp so to speak. I know this dosage isn't recommended. And 6 months into this habit, I found myself unable to cry in acting class (I could cry on my own no problem) and compulsively eating but nothing ever felt like 'enough'. Feedback in my acting classes was 'where is your drive' and I found I couldn't muster it or even be bothered to. Peaceful apathy is what I'd call it. Not useful in these situations.  \n  \nI eat a fresh wholefoods diet minus protein bars (5 star health ratings only) and have a very very active lifestyle. I intermittently fast whenever my schedule is available for it- which means 2-3 times a week. But once I started eating, it was like I couldn't stop! It wasn't until I was 6kg over my optimal, feeling clogged and sluggish that I realised I just simply wasn't getting a kick or satisfaction out of food- like my reward system had completely been dampened. It was actually a scary feeling- the food compulsions, because it felt like I had no control, and I've always prided myself in discipline. I know 6kg doesn't sound like much but I essentially when from a size 6 to 10 ladies- I'll admit a lot of it is muscle but it's not lean and I hate how heavy my body feels when it has too much muscle on it- I'm a dancer so fluidity and lightness is important. \n\nI'm now over 2 weeks off ashwa and my tears in acting class are returning! But so is the blushing and anxiety... which I'm not so stoked about. But I'm finding that any overeating feels less compulsive and more habitual at this point which is super exciting. So keen to shed off these extra kilos and feel like myself again, I'm glad this all coincided with 'bulking season'. Definitely learnt my lesson on dosage! Please learn from my experience <3"

Since I try to get protein at every meal, I’m trying to find a good time to take it with something (even just a handful of berries first thing in the morning). Lately I end up forgetting to take it at all since I haven’t figured out a good routine. Other supplements like fish oil are more straightforward since I just take it with any meal."

Is Creatine really bad for the liver?"

Specifically it causes mild asthma which I don't need an inhaler for unless I'm sick with something else. However, I live with it daily. A little cough here, a deep breath to feel it 'catch' there. Stress is also a factor for me.\n\nI'm fit, eat well, and still have problems. My dad has had similar problems his whole life, and is also fit. Immunotherapy for common allergens has helped, but I'm still just always inflamed. It's like my immune system is bored all the time.\n\nRecently I was on a six day taper of methylprednisolone for an unrelated issue, and during the time I was on the steriod I felt like I'd been cured of asthma. It was so easy to breathe, I stopped event thinking about the inflammation in my lungs etc...\n\nObviously I can't take a powerful steroid like that all the time; however, after learning how it works at a high level, I am thinking about adding some supplements to see if it has any positive impact for me.\n\nI wanted to get the opinion on what dosage to start at, what dosage to work up to, supplement brands, and if there's any other recommendations.\n\nCurrently, I take the following supplements daily:\n\n\\- Vitamin D3 (2000 IU). Bloodwork was low before supplementing, and am normal now. I'm inside almost all the time.\n\n\\- Omega-3 fish oil (600mg)\n\n\\- Vitamin B12 (1000 mcg). Bloodwork was low before supplementing, and am normal now. I eat animal protein, and meet my nutritional needs for protein, but the B12 was still low.\n\nI'm considering adding the following:\n\n\\- Curcumin. Maybe start @ 450mg?\n\n\\- Resveratrol. 500mg?\n\n\\- Alpha-lipoic acid. 100mg?\n\n\\- Berberine. 550mg?\n\nI could increase the dose over time, but was thinking about starting small.\n\nI could get the ALA from Costco combined with CoQ10 and Acetyl L-Carnitine, but not ALA on its own. I'm not sure if the brands Costco sells are decent for the supplements listed above, or if I should look elsewhere? I was thinking about adding NAC; however, I read it can have negative interactions with Curcumin.\n\nThanks for any advice."

In contrast the calcium carbonate powder I have from Nutricost is super fine and powdery in the jar and dissolves without problem in water. Maybe it is not possible to get magnesium oxide fine powder because it is hygroscopic. I will also try pressing before I put in water.\n\nEDIT: I Tried pressing the magnesium flat with a butter knife on a hard surface to press out the clumps before pouring it in the water. I got much better results and it dissolved almost completely in the water with almost nothing in the bottom of the glass of water."

Questions about my new buylist.\n\nPost: **For TLDR: Skip to 'What I PLAN on buying tomorrow, and Why(input/help requested!)'**  \n\nHeyo, so to make a long story short - I started taking Adderall to treat my ADHD back in September of last year, and ever since combining Adderall with Zoloft+Buspirone, my private 'hobby' has kind of taken a nose-dive in terms of enjoyability, pleasure, and even practicality, leading me to this:\n\n# What I take at the moment:\n\n* Maca Root, 3 grams a day, split into 2 doses; one in the morning before breakfast, and one at night before bed.\n* L-Arginine, 4 grams a day, split into 2 doses, also one in the morning and at night.\n* Selenium, 200mcg taken at night\n* Omega 3s\n* B12(apparently good for people on Adderall, and also good for Type 1 diabetics, of which I am one of)\n* Magnesium(since Adderall depletes magnesium levels; I take it at night, not sure of the dosage atm)\n\n# The problems I am seeking to fix with this stack:\n\n1. Frequently, I will lose interest mid-'session'(because now, it has become a session since it is such a process...), and my guy goes down... And then, when I do have it going and I'm into it...\n2. It takes forever to finish. Like, my god - I will sit there and pound at this thing for literally an hour straight until I finally can finish, and by then I am more just trying to get to the end, which of course makes the end ultimately suck.\n3. General lack of interest in the activity itself, women, men(I'm bi), etc\n\n# What it has done for me so far:\n\nSo, in order to try and help fix the above issues, I started reading up on some things other people on Adderall have done, and I learned about Maca root and L-Arginine; how Adderall is a vasoconstrictor, and how L-Arginine can promote Nitric Oxide production and increase vasodilation through that, so starting back a few months ago I began taking both of them.  \n\nThe first month was pretty awesome not gonna lie. I don't know if it was the Maca or the L-Arginine, but hol\\~y crap, it wasn't just working better - it actually *felt* better. That's what really opened my eyes to the world of supplements.   \n\nI started reading up more on the two, and found out they were apart of some meme-stack called the '[god-tier c\\*m](https://archive.org/download/1551656613734-0/1551656613734-0.png)' (It's just L-Arginine+Lechitin+Zinc+Selenium), which, yeah- it makes sense;  \n\n(Also note - I saw a big bottle of Selenium in Walmart after seeing that pic a while ago and bought it... yeah that stuff definitely increases the volume that uh... your fellahs produce. I can personally attest to that.)  \n\nNow that I've brought up Walmart that leads me to this:  \n\n# What I PLAN on buying tomorrow, and Why(input/help requested!)\n\nUp until now, I've been buying my Maca and L-Arginine both from Walmart, in the Spring Valley brand(which apparently sucks from what I've read on here.) - I'm going to be buying them online tomorrow for the first time, and I have gone ahead and picked out some extra ones to add onto it, since I'm not really getting as good results with the stack now as I was back when I began.\n\nFrom what I have read, it's because Maca has a tolerance that builds up, and also L-Arginine has low bioavailability, and L-Citrulline is better(QUESTION: Should I combine them?)\n\nSo here is the list of all the stuff I wanna buy next month(including some of the other ones I've seen talked about. **NOTE: All of them are by Nutricost! Please advise me on if this is a good idea or not:**\n\n1. Nutricost Sunflower Lecithin (1 Pound) \\~ $19.95\n2. Nutricost Maca Root Capsules (Lepidium meyenii) 750mg, 180 Capsules \\~ $15.95 (**Question:** Should I get this from 'The Maca Team' ? I read some people talking about how their Maca kinda made them feel all wired and jittery and strange, and it kind of has  turned me off of them. I very much want a good source for my Maca though.)\n3. Nutricost Zinc Citrate (50 mg) 120 Capsules \\~ $11.50(I read that apparently, you can deplete your zinc levels by doing the deed too much, and I noticed my multivamin didn't have any in it, and my diet didn't really have much either, so I went ahead and added it)\n4. Nutricost Selenium 200mcg, Vegetarian Capsules \\~ $13.95\n5. Nutricost L-Citrulline 500mg, 120 Capsules \\~ $12.95(**Question**: How many at a time do you need?)  \n\nThank you!  \n\nSorry about the long post."

All of my scans have been perfect, and I am effectively cancer free according to my doctors. Thank goodness! In spite of that, I am still having a tough time putting weight on like I used to, and I still have other symptoms (like night sweating) which are commonly associated with cancer. Because of all that, I decided that it was finally time to get my ass back in the gym. The way I see it is, if I can actually build some mass and keep it on, then I have little reason to be concerned about my health at this point (considering the good scans and the word of my doctors.)  \n  \n**Part of that process for me has always been consuming whey protein powder.** I was struggling to hit the recommended macros for my weight, even before getting cancer, and that is especially the case now. In the past, I would default to Nutricost's Choc/PB Whey Isolate, which I would drink with milk or blend it into a smoothie after my workout. At the time, I was very satisfied with their product and this routine. Since getting cancer, however, I have become concerned over the fact that a lot of these commercial protein powders contain lead and other heavy metals, as well as BPA, etc... and started looking into possible alternatives to Nutricost. So far, I have had a very hard time finding anything that is up to my standards. I even looked into organic beef protein as a potentially viable alternative to whey protein, only to discover that the most \"organic-seeming\" brand I could find contained 5x the level of arsenic as a can of sardines. I've looked into other types of protein too, and I just keep getting crap.\n\nAs somebody who is just getting over cancer, I am really not trying to poison myself with this sort of thing any longer; I *want* to make healthy lifestyle changes. I've been doing a ton of research over these past two weeks, but I keep coming up short. A lot of places don't display their heavy metals testing-- or, if they do, the tests are rarely ever dated. I've personally called around and emailed many of these companies directly, but they won't send me their tests. I am hearing many versions of \"Yeah, we're compliant, I promise... No we won't send you the tests, those are proprietary,\" and I can't tell you how absolutely frustrating this is as a diligent consumer.  \n  \nCan anybody please recommend me a few brands to look into, that meet my criteria? I want an organic, daily-use protein powder that is free of BS. No heavy metals, BPA, and other carcinogenic crap... It does not need to be easy to mix, I just want as few additives as humanly possible."

    "combined_text": "Title: Something didn't feel right, so, I had Gemini, do a full data analysis and report on \"Menerals, LLC\".  Have fun :)\n\nPost: # Analysis of \"Menerals\" Dietary Supplement: A Due Diligence Report\n\n\n\n\n\n# Executive Summary\n\n\n\nThis report provides a multi-faceted assessment of the \"Menerals\" supplement brand, synthesizing available corporate, scientific, and consumer data to inform a comprehensive due diligence review. The investigation was significantly constrained by the profound scarcity of verifiable information. The official website,[https://menerals.com/](https://menerals.com/), is inaccessible, and the brand's digital footprint is remarkably minimal. Corporate records reveal a direct contradiction between the company's legal registration address in West Virginia and its public-facing address on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) in Nevada. This corporate opacity, coupled with a lack of market presence and third-party accreditation, represents a major risk for a consumer brand.\n\nGiven the product's likely nature, a detailed scientific analysis of common mineral supplements and fulvic acid was conducted to provide essential context. This analysis reveals that while minerals are essential for human health, there is limited scientific evidence to support the use of supplements for the general population. The likely inclusion of fulvic acid in a \"Menerals\" product presents a notable risk profile, as this ingredient is associated with potential side effects, interactions with various medications, and a significant risk of heavy metal contamination due to imprecise purification. The broader regulatory landscape, as evidenced by enforcement actions from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against other companies, highlights the common industry practices of making unproven health claims and selling adulterated products. In conclusion, the \"Menerals\" brand exhibits multiple characteristics of a high-risk venture, lacking the transparency, credible feedback, and scientific backing that would be expected of a legitimate dietary supplement company.\n\n\n\n# 1. Introduction and Analytical Framework\n\n\n\n\n\n# 1.1. Report Objectives and Scope\n\n\n\nThis report is designed to provide an expert-level analysis of the \"Menerals\" supplement brand by synthesizing all available information. The scope of this analysis is broad, encompassing an examination of the brand's corporate legitimacy, market presence, and consumer sentiment. Furthermore, it includes a critical scientific review of the efficacy and safety of the ingredients commonly found in such products, followed by an overview of the regulatory environment to provide a complete picture for due diligence. The objective is to produce a nuanced, evidence-based assessment that can guide a potential consumer, journalist, or professional investigator.\n\n\n\n# 1.2. Methodological Limitations and Data Contamination\n\n\n\nThe investigation was fundamentally challenged by a profound scarcity of relevant information, necessitating a reliance on contextual and inferential analysis. The single most critical limitation is the inaccessibility of the official website,[https://menerals.com/](https://menerals.com/).Without access to this primary source, it is impossible to verify the product's official marketing claims, a definitive list of its ingredients, dosage recommendations, or any purported scientific evidence the company might offer.  \n\n\n\nThe research material is heavily polluted with irrelevant information, a phenomenon that itself is a key finding. The digital environment is saturated with content related to topics that share similar-sounding names or spellings, requiring rigorous filtering. These irrelevant search results include a wide range of topics:\n\n* Discussions and articles related to video games such as Stellaris and other online communities. \n* Detailed information on surf camps and travel companies in various global locations. \n* Corporate profiles for other, unrelated \"mineral\" companies in the oil and gas or industrial sectors, such as Minerals Technologies Inc. and ES3 Minerals LLC. \n* Generic consumer complaints from platforms like eBay that are not specific to the \"Menerals\" brand and often describe issues with shipping and communication for other products. \n\nThe presence of this significant amount of \"noise\" signals a remarkably low digital profile for the target brand, highlighting a critical absence of an established market presence.\n\n\n\n# 2. Corporate and Market Presence Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.1. Business Registration and Corporate Profile\n\n\n\nA review of corporate records reveals Menerals, LLC is legally registered in the state of West Virginia.The designated office and mailing addresses are listed as 190 Ridgeway Drive, Bridgeport, WV, with Benjamin Davisson identified as the organizer and member. \n\n\n\nHowever, a separate public-facing profile with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) provides a different location, listing \"Menerals, LLC\" in Reno, Nevada.This direct contradiction between the company's legal registration address and its public BBB profile location is a significant point of concern. A legitimate business typically maintains a consistent public presence and corporate identity. The existence of two separate, conflicting addresses creates an immediate barrier to conducting effective due diligence and complicates any potential legal or consumer protection actions. This discrepancy may indicate an unestablished business, a dropshipping model, or an intentional effort to obscure the true nature of its operations, all of which undermine consumer trust and accountability. The BBB profile also indicates that the business is not currently rated because it has been in business for less than six months and does not yet have a sufficient track record.This finding is central to understanding the brand's nascent status and its minimal digital footprint.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.2. Market Footprint and Third-Party Accreditations\n\n\n\nThe brand’s market footprint appears to be in its earliest stages, with no established reputation or third-party accreditations. Menerals, LLC is not a BBB Accredited Business, a status that requires a commitment to upholding the organization's standards for trust. Its unrated status with the BBB is a direct consequence of its recent formation.The absence of an established history contrasts sharply with a well-regarded company like BiOptimizers USA Inc., which holds an A+ BBB rating in a similar category and location, demonstrating a long-standing commitment to consumer trust.The lack of any formal accreditations or certifications is a further red flag, as these are critical benchmarks for consumer confidence in the dietary supplement industry.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 2.3. Consumer Feedback and Public Sentiment\n\n\n\nThe brand has an extremely limited to non-existent digital footprint in terms of consumer feedback. A comprehensive review of public forums like Reddit reveals no substantive discussions about the \"Menerals\" supplement. Search queries related to the brand name yield results that are overwhelmingly unrelated to dietary supplements, often linking to discussions about gaming or other general topics. The only relevant result is a thread title on the \n\n\n\nr/Supplements subreddit, \"My experience with Menerals,\" but the associated content is noted as being inaccessible. The complete lack of public reviews or a discernible customer base suggests one of two scenarios: either the brand is so new that it has not yet generated a customer base large enough for public discussion, or it is a \"ghost\" brand with no real product fulfillment or customer service. The total absence of feedback is a significant data point, as it is a more compelling sign of a potential lack of legitimacy than a handful of negative reviews.  \n\n\n\n**Table 1: Corporate and Market Profile of Menerals, LLC**\n\n||\n||\n|Attribute|Information from West Virginia Registry|Information from Better Business Bureau|\n|**Legal Name**|Menerals, LLC|Menerals, LLC|\n|**Registration State**|West Virginia  |N/A|\n|**Designated Officer**|Benjamin Davisson  |N/A|\n|**Legal Address**|190 RIDGEWAY DRIVE, BRIDGEPORT, WV  |10437 Double R Blvd. Reno, NV 89521  |\n|**BBB Accreditation**|N/A|NOT BBB Accredited  |\n|**BBB Rating**|N/A|Not Rated (In business less than 6 months)  |\n\n\n\n# 3. Product Claims and Scientific Context\n\n\n\n\n\n# 3.1. The Critical Data Gap: Absence of Official Website Content\n\n\n\nAs noted previously, the inaccessibility of the official website makes it impossible to conduct a direct analysis of the product's specific claims, ingredients, or dosage information. Therefore, the following scientific review is based on an analysis of the principles and common components associated with a product named \"Menerals.\"  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 3.2. Foundational Scientific Principles of Mineral Supplementation\n\n\n\nMinerals are foundational to human health, serving as essential nutrients that support a wide range of physiological functions, from bone development to nerve signaling.They are broadly classified into macrominerals (e.g., calcium, phosphorus, magnesium) and trace minerals (e.g., iron, zinc, selenium).While a balanced diet is generally sufficient to provide these nutrients, the dietary supplement market is built on the premise of filling perceived \"gaps\" in nutrition.  \n\n\n\nHowever, extensive clinical research indicates that the broad use of multivitamin and mineral supplements does not provide overall benefits for the majority of the population.A comprehensive analysis of studies involving over 450,000 people found that multivitamins did not reduce the risk for chronic diseases like heart disease or cancer, nor did they slow cognitive decline or reduce the risk of an early death. In some cases, supplements have even been shown to be deleterious. For example, a trial in Finnish smokers showed that beta-carotene supplements statistically significantly increased lung cancer incidence. This broad scientific consensus among major medical institutions serves as a cautious baseline against which any unproven claims for \"Menerals\" must be measured.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 3.3. In-Depth Ingredient Review: Fulvic Acid and Mineral Complexes\n\n\n\nAssuming \"Menerals\" is a mineral complex, it is highly likely to contain fulvic acid, a common ingredient in such supplements. A review of this compound reveals a high degree of uncertainty regarding its purported benefits and a significant number of documented risks.\n\n* **Fulvic Acid:** Research indicates that fulvic acid, a group of chemicals that form during the breakdown of organic matter, is anecdotally used for a variety of conditions, including hay fever and fatigue. However, there is \"no good scientific evidence to support these uses,\" and any alleged benefits from its anti-inflammatory or neuroprotective properties are largely unproven in human studies. A significant danger associated with fulvic acid is the risk of heavy metal contamination, as the compound is extracted from soil and requires thorough purification to avoid harmful elements like lead and mercury in the final product. This risk is particularly high for products from suppliers who use unreliable extraction methods. From a health perspective, fulvic acid is associated with side effects such as diarrhea, headaches, and a sore throat. It may also worsen autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, by boosting the activity of the immune system. Furthermore, it can interfere with medications that slow blood clotting or suppress the immune system. \n* **Common Mineral Complexes:** Using ZMA (Zinc, Magnesium Aspartate, and Vitamin B6) as a representative example, the research shows that while each component is essential for bodily functions, there is limited research to support the common claims made by manufacturers about enhanced muscle strength, recovery, or sleep quality.A registered dietitian advises that for most people, a balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients, and supplementation should only be considered in the case of a verified deficiency. \n* **Risks of Excessive Doses:** The research explicitly warns that taking high doses of various minerals can be harmful. For instance, taking more than 400 mg of magnesium supplements can cause diarrhea. High doses of copper can lead to stomach pain and, over time, damage the liver and kidneys. The use of manganese supplements at high doses for long periods might cause muscle pain, nerve damage, and other neurological symptoms. The lack of a verified dosage for the \"Menerals\" product, due to the inaccessible website, compounds the health risks for a potential consumer.  \n\n**Table 2: Summary of Scientific Consensus on Mineral Supplementation and Fulvic Acid**\n\n||\n||\n|Ingredient|Role in the Body|Scientifically Supported Benefits|Potential Risks and Side Effects|\n|**Magnesium**|Turns food into energy, supports muscle and nerve function, promotes bone health.  |May ease symptoms of depression and anxiety.  |High doses (more than 400mg) can cause diarrhea.  |\n|**Zinc**|Supports immune system, cell creation, and wound healing.  |May help lower fasting blood sugar in people with diabetes.  |Excessive intake can have negative effects.  |\n|**Fulvic Acid**|Forms during breakdown of plants/animals; often found in humus.  |Anecdotal uses for hay fever and Alzheimer's, but no good scientific evidence to support these claims.  |Can worsen autoimmune diseases, interact with blood thinners, and may be contaminated with heavy metals.Side effects include diarrhea and headaches.  |\n\n\n\n# 4. Regulatory and Compliance Review\n\n\n\n\n\n# 4.1. The U.S. Regulatory Framework for Dietary Supplements\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the dietary supplement industry is primarily regulated by the FDA and FTC.Under federal law, dietary supplements do not require pre-market approval. However, they cannot be promoted for the treatment of a disease, as they are not proven to be safe and effective for such purposes.The FTC focuses on preventing false and misleading advertising, which can include unproven health claims and the use of \"gag clauses\" to suppress negative consumer reviews.The FDA's enforcement is primarily post-market, where it can issue warning letters or take legal action against companies for violations.  \n\n\n\n\n\n# 4.2. Analysis of Regulatory Actions (Case Studies)\n\n\n\nA review of regulatory enforcement actions against other companies provides valuable context for the risks associated with a brand like \"Menerals.\"\n\n* **Mother Earth Minerals, Inc.:** The FDA issued a warning letter to this company following an inspection and a review of claims made on its website, highlighting the agency's authority to act on a brand’s publicly available information. \n* **Mineral Store, Inc./Elemental Research, Inc.:** This case is particularly relevant. The FDA issued a warning for the product \"Cesium Plus,\" citing significant violations.The company failed to submit a new dietary ingredient notification, a requirement for any new ingredient not previously present in the U.S. food supply before 1994.The FDA also determined the product to be adulterated, stating there was \"no history of use or other evidence of safety\" for cesium chloride. The agency cited reports of serious heart problems in humans and animals associated with the ingredient, concluding that it presented a significant risk of illness or injury.This enforcement action is a textbook example of the types of risks that can arise with a product containing unverified or novel trace elements, which is highly pertinent to a brand named \"Menerals.\"  \n\nThe lack of any public-facing information for \"Menerals\" makes it impossible to verify its compliance with these regulations, but its general lack of transparency and a verifiable business history suggests a high risk of similar violations.\n\n\n\n# 5. Synthesis and Recommendations\n\n\n\n\n\n# 5.1. A Multi-Layered Risk Assessment\n\n\n\nBased on the multi-faceted analysis, the \"Menerals\" supplement brand exhibits a high-risk profile across all key areas of due diligence.\n\n* **Corporate Risk (High):** The conflicting addresses on legal and public records, coupled with the brand’s unrated and unaccredited status with the BBB, points to a significant lack of transparency and a nascent, potentially unstable corporate structure.\n* **Market Risk (High):** The complete absence of an official website and the minimal to non-existent consumer feedback make it impossible to conduct basic due diligence on the product, its claims, or its customer support. This non-existent digital footprint is highly unusual and suspicious for a modern consumer product.\n* **Scientific and Health Risk (High):** Based on the product's name, it likely contains mineral complexes and possibly fulvic acid. The scientific consensus on the general efficacy of multivitamins is cautious at best. The known risks associated with fulvic acid—including the potential for heavy metal contamination and adverse reactions in individuals with autoimmune conditions—pose a significant health hazard, especially when product information and safety warnings are unavailable to the consumer.\n\n\n\n# 5.2. Recommendations\n\n\n\n* **Avoid Purchase:** The overwhelming number of red flags—including corporate opacity, a non-existent public profile, and the potential health risks of its likely ingredients—precludes any positive recommendation. It is not possible to verify the product's safety, efficacy, or even its physical existence.\n* **Consult a Medical Professional:** Before taking *any* dietary supplement, it is crucial to consult a doctor or a registered dietitian. The research confirms that for most people, a balanced diet provides all the necessary nutrients, and supplements may be ineffective or even harmful if taken without a medical need. \n* **Prioritize Transparency and Third-Party Verification:** When considering a dietary supplement, look for brands with a clear and consistent corporate identity, positive ratings from organizations like the BBB, and independent certifications from reputable laboratories such as [ConsumerLab.com](http://ConsumerLab.com), NSF International, or U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP). These third-party verifications are essential for ensuring a product contains what it claims to and is free of contaminants. \n\n**Table 3: Review of Available \"Feedback\" and Data Contamination**\n\n||\n||\n|Relevant Information|Irrelevant Information (Data Contamination)|\n|\"My experience with Menerals\" Reddit thread title, which is inaccessible.  |Discussions about video games like Stellaris.  |\n|Menerals, LLC profile on the Better Business Bureau.  |Information about industrial companies like Minerals Technologies Inc. and ES3 Minerals LLC.  |\n|The legal business registration for Menerals, LLC.  |Reviews and details about surf camps and travel companies.  |\n||General, unrelated consumer complaints from an eBay seller and a networking forum.  |\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp9q2ok8uklf1.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce56d8bb4d7afa9ea5f6d1e056e39a5d8150d33\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vvecssdktklf1.png?width=3568&format=png&auto=webp&s=842a43e0c151186c8ef7e1d7d736e0a0fce164a5"

    "combined_text": "Title: Glycine as a 'Neuro-Brake' for anxiety & sleep... but does it hit the brakes on libido too?\n\nPost: Hey r/Supplements,\n\nI wanted to start a discussion about Glycine, as it's one of the most popular and effective supplements out there for a few key reasons.\n\nFor many, including myself, it's been a game-changer. The general benefits are well-known and seem to work for a lot of people:\n\n* **Improved Sleep Quality:** This is the big one. It can help lower core body temperature and promotes a feeling of calm, leading to deeper, more restorative sleep without morning grogginess.\n* **Calming / Anxiolytic Effects:** It acts as a neurotransmitter, which can help take the edge off anxiety and stress during the day.\n* **Collagen & Connective Tissue Support:** It's a key component of collagen, so it’s great for skin, joint, and bone health.\n* **Glutathione Precursor:** It helps the body produce glutathione, a master antioxidant.\n\n**The Surprising (and Unofficial) Side Effect**\n\nHowever, while digging through forums and anecdotal reports online, I've come across a recurring theme: **a noticeable decrease in libido / sex drive.**\n\nI want to be clear, this is **not** a common side effect listed in major clinical studies, which makes it all the more interesting to discuss from a user-experience. To my knowledge, no study has specifically examined the **relationship** between glycine intake and libido\n\n**Diving into the 'Why': The Plausible Pathways**\n\nBefore just dismissing it,  there are actually a few plausible mechanisms that could explain why this might happen in some individuals:\n\n1. **Glycine as an Inhibitory Neurotransmitter:** This is the most likely explanation. Glycine's main job in the central nervous system is to be a \"brake pedal.\" It calms things down. Sexual arousal and libido, on the other hand, require strong \"gas pedal\" signals from excitatory neurotransmitters (like dopamine). It’s possible that by boosting the body's primary \"brake\" system, Glycine inadvertently dampens the excitatory signals needed for a strong libido in some people.\n2. **The Serotonin Connection:** Some research suggests that Glycine can influence and increase serotonin levels in the brain. As many people know from the side effects of SSRI antidepressants, elevated serotonin is very frequently linked to a decreased sex drive. If Glycine is nudging serotonin levels up, it could potentially be causing a similar, though likely much milder, effect.\n3. **Indirect Hormonal Influence (More Speculative):** Glycine can have some influence on the pituitary gland. Any significant shift in hormones like prolactin could theoretically impact libido, though the evidence for this pathway is much weaker than the first two.\n\n**So, I'm turning to the collective wisdom of this sub:**\n\nI'm curious to see if the anecdotal reports hold any weight in a larger group.\n\n* Has anyone else experienced a noticeable drop in libido while taking glycine?\n* If you did, what was your dosage and when did you take it (e.g., 3g before bed)?\n* Did the effect go away if you stopped or lowered the dose?\n* Conversely, has anyone noticed **no effect** or even a **positive** one on their libido, perhaps due to the benefits of better sleep and lower stress?\n\nGlycine is fantastic for sleep. However, some experienced a potential drop in libido. This could be biologically explained by Glycine's role as a primary \"brake\" (inhibitory) neurotransmitter in the body or its potential to increase serotonin. Wondering if anyone in the community can confirm or deny this from their own experience."

    "combined_text": "Title: Hollow undereyes and temples and collagen degradation after taking a Malaysian supplement laced with corticosteroids (18M)\n\nPost: I’m 18 and I need to ask about something unusual that happened after taking a supplement called Kian Pee Wan which I very recently found out is laced with corticosteroids. I have no idea which corticosteroid exactly. Based on the manufacturer’s other products and what I've read about them it’s most likely dexamethasone.\n\nDuring each period I took this supplement, my temples and under-eyes became hollow noticeably. Before taking it, despite being severely underweight for years, I had a lot of volume just UNDER my eyes and my temples weren’t THAT thin (but my cheeks were, obviously) the back of my jaw didn't look big or anything.\n\nThe hollowing worsened with each round of exposure. Looking back, the changes happened only during the times I took the supplement, I didn’t realize it at the time. This is not normal aging. This time this has become too hard to ignore I cannot keep living in denial and I highly suspect the corticosteroid in the supplement has been somehow hurting. My eyes literally look sunken, my face looks absolutely horrible from below/lower angle. My eyes used to be narrow and wide and now they look rounded as if something is constantly very lightly pulling on the bottom of them and there is this weird ridge on my eyelids from it as if there is excess skin.\n\nIn the Summer of 2024 I did a 1-month course. January 2025, 2 week (ish) course. In last may I did a 3 week course and starting on June 20th I did a roughly 45-day course which is the most recent. now I completely stopped.\n\n\nEven though I gained 20 pounds during the last round NONE of the fat went to my temples. they’re still hollow and look even worse than before\n\nMy arms actually gained subcutaneous fat which is really weird since corticosteroids supposedly cause fat loss in the arms. Yes I did get moon face in the lower half of my face (everything under my cheekbone), my stomach got a little bit bigger, but no fat loss in the arms??\n\n\nI also suspect the corticosteroids severely impacted my collagen and skin health my nasolabial folds are now very pronounced my skin barrier feels destroyed, and skin looks unhealthy overall and aged. Indentations on my forehead appeared that weren’t there before. Also after the first time I tried this supplement, I noticed dehydration lines around my mouth that I had never seen before in my life.\n\n\nI cannot find anybody else that has experienced this issue. Everything on reddit and google talks about moon face, buffalo hump, or peripheral limb fat loss, but nothing like this.\n\nI want to make this clear I did not take prescription corticosteroids deliberately. This was a contaminated supplement. I was laced. I'm not trying to promote anything illegal/dangerous and I don't plan on taking this shit ever again.\n\nHas anyone else experienced hollow temples or under-eyes after corticosteroids? Does anyone know how this might have happened and if this might improve after stopping, losing the gained weight, and waiting long-term? Because that's what I plan on doing. I also plan on taking biosil for my collagen, and a multivitamin since my diet has always been pretty lacking. I would seriously appreciate any insight.\n\nTL;DR: Took a Malaysian supplement (Kian Pee Wan) that was secretly laced with corticosteroids. Instead of just “moon face,” I developed severe hollowing in my temples/under eyes and skin/collagen damage that got worse each round. Stopped now and wondering if anyone else had this and if it can improve long-term"

Over time, I ended up with a whole box full of pills. I drink 4–5 liters of water daily, go to the gym regularly, had blood tests done, and even asked a doctor if I was doing anything wrong. He said no, but warned me not to overdo it.\n\nI don’t want to stop because whenever I take a week off, I feel terrible. I mainly take them because my diet consists only of meat, rice, and avocado, so I use supplements to cover the micronutrients I don’t get enough of from food. But I wonder could this lead to allergic reactions over time? Should I cut back a bit?"

Like 70 bucks/ month for one bottle, one month supply. \n\nTwo products are testosterone support. They have several herbs, fernigreek and such. Amino acids. That sort of thing.\n\nThey also contain shilajit, which I know from doing a little reading is generally not legitimate in a capsule form. It needs to be a resin, it's kind of rare and kind of expensive, mixing it up with a bunch of stuff in a capsule is just sort of suspicious. Suspicious for being poor quality, amounts to nothing, a waste of money, is what I mean. \n\nCurious if anyone has any insight or commentary or experience with this individual or his products.

I think his profit margins might be massive on these products, which appear to be basic blends of fairly common minerals and herbs and such.. . . that are sold at a fairly exorbitant price."

Honestly, I don’t fully understand this division — what are the judges really looking for here? Is it about conditioning, presentation, or more about elegance and stage presence?\n\nBoth look amazing to me, but I can’t really tell what would make one better than the other. Can someone who follows this category explain how the judging works and maybe who has the edge here?\n\nCredits: https://www.instagram.com/p/DNlwg5eiZj2/?img_index=1&igsh=MTZucnQwcHk2MmR3MA=="

Wasn’t quite as lean as I could’ve been.\n\nGot feedback from Bill Sibilia, an Olympia level judge, he said “You have everything in the right place, shape is perfect, massive potential… but I’d like to see you closer to your weight cap.  Take the year or even 2 to fill out your cap and you’re going to go very far.”\n\nMy original plan was to do this show then rebuild for 2 weeks and then cut for 6 weeks to hit the Hurricane Classic on October 16.  But one of the big take away from the pro seminar (10 Olympia level athletes) was to tune out the noise, listen to your coach and judges feedback…\n\nSo we are taking the feedback and going all in on growth.  Gonna get to my cap next season (PEELED)… was 227 at weigh ins… cap is 242 so if we assume I could’ve been 5 lbs leaner I’ve got 20lbs of tissue to build."

When I was in high school I was a major bodybuilding fan and knew I wanted to compete then, but then life happens as it does and I lost sight of that vision. So glad to be back and actually pursuing something I’ve been passionate about for a long time. \n\nBasically I am wanting to compete in the Texas State Pro/Am in 14 weeks, but due to it being a more competitive show  (from what I’ve heard) and me having 0 stage experience, I think it would be beneficial to do a smaller show to get some experience. I think I could bring a decent package in 7 weeks with the idea of being peeled and peaked for the TXST. \n\nMy diet is extremely aggressive, eating a meal plan provided by my coach. Lean proteins, veggies, fruit, and 1 carb meal ~2h pre workout. \n\nCardio\n4x week stairs 40 mins 6 speed\n2x week incline walk 15% 3 speed \n10k steps daily, 12k Sunday (minimum)\n\nTraining \nPPL Rest UL"

Robinson, Jr. photographed by Richard “Dick”Falcon.\nRichard “Dick” Falcon 1909-2005.\nBorn in Italy and raised in Ohio, Falcon emerged as a seminal figure in mid-century American physique photography. His early passion for physical culture led him to bodybuilding, gym ownership, and life modeling at Ohio State University—where his eye for the male form took artistic flight. Working primarily in gelatin silver prints, Falcon’s imagery appeared in vintage physique magazines like Tomorrow’s Man, and his studio served both fitness enthusiasts and a discreet network of collectors. His Columbus-based Falcon Athletic Club became a hub for photographing hundreds of athletes with anatomical precision and subtle emotion.\n\nLetter from Robinson to bodybuilder Stuart Wright:\n“Dear Stu-\n\nWas concerned for your safety so I called your Dad to see if you are okay and not in need up to your big beautiful pecs. Was glad to hear you are high, dry, & handsome. Of course I already knew you were handsome.\n\nEnclosed are some recent pics of a Florida gig. They are by Dick Falcon. Have ordered 13 of them in 8x10. Thought you might enjoy these. Do hope you get by A.M.D. while you are there- I know you’d enjoy yourself and have fun if you do.\n\nAm driving everywhere now. I really enjoy the freedom. Drove to Houston June 3-5. Got the flu- was real ill for 2 weeks. Ok now except for cough. Hope the pants [?] and shirt fit. Write when you can.\n\nP.S. I really appreciated your XMAS visit, you looked great! Sincerely, Bill”"

Given skin colour, do I need a tan or would the stage glaze that’s given as part of show be enough?\n2. Weight cap is 98.4kg, does that seem feasible given current state/condition to come in competitive? It will be a natural show, no plans on stepping on gear until maybe mid 30s at earliest if ever tbh \n3. When it comes to the final weeks, is there anything that I really need to make sure to think about? Asking experienced competitors. Essentially what tips do you have for peaking as well as possible?\n4. In terms of cardio, would steps be enough to get to where I need to or would there need to be specific focused cardio? Thinking of doing 30mins on stairmaster from like 8 weeks out. \n5. I do have exams to study for.

    "text": "Cuproptosis represents a novel form of mitochondria-dependent cell death, demonstrating a unique antitumor potential. However, tumor cells have evolved robust metabolic compensation mechanisms that mitigate the cytotoxic effects of copper ions; this barrier must be disrupted to trigger cuproptosis. In this study, a metallic metabolic nano-regulator (MC@BSA; MC, manganese-copper nanocomposite; BSA, bovine serum albumin) is designed, which efficiently accumulates in tumor tissues and disrupts copper homeostasis by inhibiting copper efflux and promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). MC@BSA perturbs the copper ion equilibrium, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, lipoylated protein aggregation, and ATP depletion. MC@BSA downregulates the PKM2/HIF-1α/DLAT signaling axis, effectively decoupling glycolysis from the mitochondrial metabolism and enhancing the cellular sensitivity to cuproptosis. The therapeutic potency of MC@BSA is augmented by the addition of a PKM2 activator (TEPP-46) to form an MC@BSA + TEPP-46 complex. TEPP-46 stabilizes PKM2 in its tetrameric form and inhibits its nuclear transcriptional functions, thereby intensifying metabolic disruption and oxidative stress, and amplifying the antitumor efficacy. In vivo experiments confirm that MC@BSA + TEPP-46 suppresses tumor growth without inducing significant systemic toxicity, highlighting its therapeutic safety and robust pharmacological profile. This strategy advances the understanding of copper-mediated cell death mechanisms and introduces a powerful avenue for metabolic intervention in cancer therapy."

While cationic materials are widely utilized for cfDNA capture, their safety during in vivo delivery remains a critical concern. Additionally, macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses exacerbate disease progression. Here, we propose a charge-reversal and enhanced nanoassembly responsive to the inflammatory microenvironment, composed of a block polymer termed polycaprolactone-poly (N, N-dimethylacrylamide)-thioketal-polyethylene glycol (PCL-PDMA-TK-PEG, PPTP), a copolymer methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly-l-lysine-2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (mPEG-PLL-DMA, PLM), and 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI). Charge reversal in acidic inflammatory microenvironments and ROS-responsive enhancement of positive surface charge, significantly improving cfDNA capture efficiency within inflammatory sites. Mitochondrial targeting through electrostatic interactions, promoting 4-OI release to inhibit macrophage-driven inflammation. Reduced protein shielding during systemic circulation, enabling precise accumulation in inflamed joints. The 4-OI@PPTP/PLM nanoassembly effectively suppresses inflammatory cytokine production, mitigates synovial hyperplasia, and attenuates bone erosion in collagen-induced arthritis models. This strategy integrates cfDNA scavenging with microenvironment reprogramming, offering a dual-action therapeutic platform for RA management."

These approaches will enable novel gene therapy treatments as well as other nucleic acid and protein therapies, while doing so in a manner that is noninvasive, improves drug efficacy, and reduces systemic side effects. Despite the exciting potential of delivering macromolecules to the lungs, there has been only one therapeutic (i.e., Pulmozyme®) approved by the FDA in the last 30 years. The significant challenges to pulmonary delivery have hindered the development of many potential treatments. These challenges include the stability of proteins/nucleic acids during both encapsulation and delivery, the clearance mechanism of the airway and lungs, and the safety of the delivery vectors. Researchers have developed multiple approaches and materials to address these issues, including modification of the macromolecule, development of novel materials (polymers, lipids, and inorganics) for fabricating nano/microparticles, and the addition of excipients to the formulation. In this review article, we summarize and compare synthesis methods, encapsulation, delivery, controlled release strategies, and the shortcomings of recently developed prospective pulmonary protein/nucleic acid delivery vectors."

In this study, we developed a series of novel D-π-A structured fluorescent probes (PM-1, PM-2, PM-3, and PM-4), Among which PM-4 demonstrates weak monomer emission (540 nm) in aqueous solution. The pyridine side chain of PM-4 forms hydrogen bonds with the dual carboxylate groups of Asp/Glu, triggering the formation of emissive excimers. This process generates a new, enhanced red-shifted emission peak at 630 nm, enabling specific detection. The detection limits reached 1.26 μM (Asp) and 1.29 μM (Glu), with high selectivity. The formation mechanism of the probe-analyte complex was confirmed by NMR titration experiments. PM-4 successfully monitored diurnal fluctuations of Asp/Glu in saliva samples from healthy volunteers and concentration variations after smoking, revealing a correlation with emotional states (e.g., peak concentrations observed 10 min after smoking). The developed PM-4 probe integrates high sensitivity, selectivity, providing a powerful analytical tool for neurometabolic studies and disease biomarker detection. Its demonstrated performance highlights promising potential for both fundamental research and diagnostic product development."

Central to our approach was a \"sandwich\" assay, where MUC1 was anchored between aptamer-functionalized bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and magnetic nanobeads. The biosensor was applied to monitor MUC1 in serum samples through SERS signals from the reporter molecule 4-ATP, exhibiting a strong linear correlation across a wide dynamic range and the lower the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.96 fg/mL. To support clinical decision-making, the protocol was integrated with a machine learning (ML)model for the classification of SERS signal patterns, demonstrating performance metrics of 96% accuracy and 93.7% specificity when applied to diverse serum samples. This integration enabled robust, non-invasive preclinical screening that informs therapeutic regulation and patient monitoring long before clinical symptoms present. By establishing a scalable framework for continuous monitoring of MUC1 levels across large populations, our study offered a forward-thinking tool, namely, dual-aptamer-SERS biosensor, that may optimize individualized treatment planning and improve overall clinical management strategies."

A compact fluorescence detector for the MFS-PT was also fabricated using an LED and a micro-photomultiplier (μPMT). C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with the MFS-PT-ELISA using the MFS-PT and the fluorescence detector, and the limit of CRP detection (3σ) was estimated to be 0.78 ng/mL. The MFS-PT-ELISA was approximately 1.4 times more sensitive for the measurement of CRP than an ELISA using a PT without MFS. The measurement time and sample consumption were reduced, compared to conventional methods, to approximately 1/3 (55 min) and 1/33 (3 μL), respectively. Measurement of CRP in human serum based on the MFS-PT-ELISA method gave quantitative values that were generally consistent with those obtained by the conventional method using a micro-well plate. This result indicates that the developed method can be used for the measurement of actual samples. The MFS-PT can be fabricated easily and at low cost to enable rapid ELISA implementation with simple pipetting operations; therefore, it is expected to evolve as an on-site diagnostic tool that is applicable to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, and food safety."

In this study, an electrochemical biosensor for the selective detection of C-reactive protein (CRP) was developed by modifying gold screen-printed electrodes (Au-SPE) with molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The high-performance sensor film was prepared by the electropolymerization of an aniline monomer in the presence of chitosan polysaccharide and a CRP template on the Au-SPE surface. Key parameters, including the removal agent, scanning rate and the number of electropolymerization cycles, were systematically optimized. Optimal MIP performance, characterized by an enhanced electrochemical response upon recognition of the template molecules, was achieved using a scan rate of 50 mV/s and five electropolymerization cycles. The results demonstrated that this biocompatible biosensor platform exhibited exceptional selectivity and sensitivity, enabling the detection of CRP at concentrations ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. The incorporation of chitosan into the MIP matrix represents a strategic advancement with significant potential for healthcare applications, owing to its inherent biocompatibility and well-documented benefits in tissue engineering. Additionally, chitosan improves the stabilization of macromolecular templates and enhances their binding interactions with functional monomers. Importantly, this study represents one of the first applications of chitosan-based MIPs in point-of-care (PoC) protein diagnostics."

The bioanalysis of payloads is challenging due to the need to measure trace amount amidst abundant ADC, with minor ADC degradation potentially causing substantial payload overestimation. Successful assays require careful evaluation of payload structures and effective management of ADC-related interferences. This study identifies challenges for lactone-containing free payloads, mitigates their impact on bioanalysis, and develops a validated methodology for accurate measurement of these payloads in human serum. Lactone hydrolysis and its formation from carboxylate were evaluated at various pH values in buffer solutions and serum. The lactone was completely hydrolyzed at pH 8.5 (25°C) within 25 min; it took several hours at pH 7 and was stable at pH ≤ 6. Lactone regeneration from carboxylate was rapid at pH 3 (within 5 min) and slower at pH ≥ 4. In human serum, lactone hydrolysis was relatively fast (approximately 2 h at 37°C), suggesting the carboxylate form predominates in circulation. Stability experiments showed lactone hydrolysis in serum is reversible, eliminating the need for sample treatment at clinical sites. These insights were applied in the design of a method based on protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction to quantify total payload exposure (50-10,000 pg/mL) in serum in the presence of ADC (250 µg/mL). A double liquid-liquid extraction was employed to purify the ADC before use to prevent interferences in the selectivity and stability assessment. The assay was validated according to M10 guidance and used to support clinical studies."

RCPM selectively targeted CDDP-resistant A549 (A549R) cells, efficiently accumulating within tumors. Exhibiting exceptional photothermal (PT) properties, RCPM facilitated PT-induced tumor ablation. Within the tumor microenvironment, RCPM underwent degradation, releasing high concentrations of V, Fe, and CDDP. The liberated V and Fe ions catalyzed the Fenton reaction, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing ferroptosis. Simultaneously, these metal ions synergistically suppressed the expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), glutathione (GSH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), effectively disrupting DNA repair pathways, preventing CDDP inactivation, and enhancing its cytotoxicity against A549R tumors. Furthermore, RCPM demonstrated complete and rapid renal clearance, ensuring excellent biosafety and strong clinical translational potential. In vivo studies revealed that a single administration of RCPM, combined with PT therapy, significantly inhibited NSCLC progression.

Among serious reports, both RSVPreF3 and RSVpreF were associated with 9 important medical events (IMEs), including immune thrombocytopenia, which was also classified as a designated medical event (DME). Three pregnancy-related IME signals-hemorrhage in pregnancy, fetal death, and fetal hypokinesia - were reported for RSVpreF. Descriptive analysis of time-to-onset complemented the overall safety profiling, and sensitivity analysis offered further support for the observed disproportional reporting trends in certain adverse events (AEs). Our study utilized real-world data from large-scale spontaneous reporting systems to detect AEs that were disproportionately reported following RSV vaccination, thereby generating early safety signals to inform hypothesis development and support clinical awareness."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Positive urine cultures are common in urinary stone patients, yet tools for early infection prediction are limited. To address this gap, a user-friendly, dynamic online nomogram was developed to predict the incidence of positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with 3,641 patients with urinary stones at the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. The cohort was split into training and validation sets. Key variables were identified using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, while Random Forest and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were applied to assess their importance. Online nomograms were developed and evaluated for performance through metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), probability density function (PDF), and clinical utility curve (CUC).\n\nRESULTS: Multivariate logistic analysis identified four significant predictors-bacteria (BACT), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitrite, and leukocyte esterase (LEU)-which were integrated into the nomogram. The AUC values for the overall, training, and validation sets were 90.53, 91.22, and 89.06%, respectively. Calibration curves confirmed the nomogram's accuracy, and DCA demonstrated its superior performance over individual metrics. The PDF/CUC method revealed a threshold of 0.168, which effectively distinguished 88.54% of negatives from 78.70% of positives.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This dynamic online nomogram accurately predicts positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis, helping clinicians identify high-risk individuals , optimize antibiotic use, and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and biomarker exploration are needed to enhance its generalizability."

However, the role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in AKI remains insufficiently explored. This study sought to identify potential FRGs associated with AKI through bioinformatics approaches and experimental validation.\n\nMETHODS: AKI-related datasets and FRGs were first collected. Differentially expressed FRGs linked to AKI were identified through analytical methods, followed by an examination of their biological functions. Diagnostic biomarkers were then selected using LASSO, RFE, and RF algorithms. Additionally, small pharmacological molecules associated with DE-FRGs were identified to explore the connection between DE-FRGs and AKI. qRT-PCR analysis revealed FAR1 expression in AKI, while Western blotting and IHC confirmed corresponding FAR1 protein changes in kidney tissues. TUNEL staining confirmed cell death in AKI. ROS production and ferroptosis markers were evaluated in FAR1-knockdown and FAR1-overexpressing HK-2 cells.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 106 DE-FRGs were identified, with functional enrichment analysis revealing strong associations with the MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways, as well as ferroptosis. Eight diagnostic biomarkers were selected using multiple algorithms, and their predictive accuracy was validated through ROC curve analysis. Furthermore, 13 pharmacological molecules were identified to establish a relationship between DE-FRGs and AKI. AKI renal tissue exhibited elevated cell death and reduced FAR1 expression.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study identified signaling pathways and small molecules associated with DE-FRGs in AKI.

Protein-based nanoparticle drug delivery systems (PNP-DDSs) have emerged as promising platforms to overcome limitations of conventional IBD therapies by improving drug stability and bioavailability while enabling colon-specific delivery. This review systematically classifies PNP-DDSs derived from natural proteins (albumin, gelatin, silk fibroin, and plant-derived proteins) and discusses their design principles along with strategies for intestinal targeting, including particle size and surface charge modulation, stimuli-responsive release (triggered by pH, reactive oxygen species, or enzymes), and active targeting. It highlights recent preclinical advances with oral PNP-DDSs delivering curcumin, resveratrol, 5-aminosalicylic acid, quercetin, and other anti-inflammatory agents, which demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these nanoplatforms in IBD models. Despite promising preclinical outcomes, clinical translation of PNP-DDSs remains challenging due to patient heterogeneity, manufacturing scale-up difficulties, and safety concerns. Future progress will require interdisciplinary innovation and optimization of multi‑stimuli-responsive designs for precise and safe clinical application of PNP-DDSs in IBD management."

The aim of this study is to investigate the economic impact associated with SI on healthcare costs and resource utilization among individuals with concomitant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing Danish national health registers, the study identifies patients with incident ASCVD and CKD from 2012 to 2022 based on diagnosis codes and laboratory results. SI is defined as CRP from 2 mg/L to 20 mg/L. The increased cost and use of healthcare services associated with SI is identified by comparing individuals with SI with individuals without SI. Statistical adjustments are made for age, sex, and comorbidities to control for confounding factors.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients with ASCVD and CKD, the presence of SI was significantly associated with higher healthcare interactions, with an average increase of 6.7 outpatient and 7.0 more inpatient contacts over the study period compared to those without SI. Furthermore, SI is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in healthcare expenditure, resulting in an excess cost of EUR 14,370 per patient over the first 3 years of the follow-up period.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The lack of a definitive onset date for SI complicates the analysis, as it is based on CRP tests conducted within 2 years of ASCVD and CKD diagnoses, potentially excluding individuals with prolonged SI prior to testing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SI is associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with ASCVD and CKD."

Collagen-based scaffolds offer significant promise for tissue engineering applications. This study presents a novel 5-layer collagen laminate engineered to facilitate both infection control and bone and tissue regeneration in open bone fractures. The laminate employs a layering strategy with rose bengal and green light-induced crosslinking to facilitate assembly while enabling the controlled release of three bioactive molecules, vancomycin, Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1α). Mechanical properties were evaluated using a high-capacity load cell, revealing that multi-layer configurations exhibited reduced stiffness and tensile strength compared to single-layer laminates. Notably, incubation with Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) holds the potential to enhance interlayer cohesion and improve the mechanical integrity of 5-layer laminates. Furthermore, the composition of collagen within the laminate played a critical role in determining both mechanical behavior and release kinetics. Singular sheets of Endoform™ Natural (E) collagen displayed rapid release, while Geistlich Bio-Gide® (G) collagen sheets provided sustained release, reflecting their distinct structural characteristics.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSA and AF comorbidity were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape, and hub genes were identified with the CytoHubba plug-in. A diagnostic model was then built based on these hub genes, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in both the test and validation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using CIBERSORT.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 1,462 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for the comorbidity of AF and OSA.

Benefits of vaccination were calculated through incremental differences for coverage rates of 30% and 70% versus no vaccination. Uncertainty in key inputs was explored using one-way sensitivity analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Among adults ≥60 years, 22.3 million RSV ARI cases, ~936,000 RSV LRTD hospitalizations, ~862,000 pneumonia, and ~89,000 deaths were projected across the six countries, over 5 years. Assuming a 30% coverage, adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination would prevent 2.6 million RSV ARI cases, 140,138 hospitalizations, 128,996 pneumonia cases, and 13,315 deaths.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results showed a substantial burden of RSV in Latin America that could be greatly alleviated through adjuvanted RSVPreF3 vaccination of adults ≥60 years."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Transthyretin (TTR) is a highly conserved protein with crucial and broadly protective physiologic roles across organ systems and diseases. Evidence shows that TTR contributes to neuroprotection, cognition, glucose regulation, pregnancy, muscle development, and bone mineralization. In several disease states, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and osteoporosis, higher TTR levels may be protective. Numerous studies have shown that low levels of TTR are associated with increased mortality overall and in relation to cardiovascular disease and several malignancies.\n\nPURPOSE: There is a growing portfolio of approved and investigational transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) treatments that differ in their mechanisms and effects on circulating TTR. When selecting an ATTR therapy, clinicians must decide whether to stabilize and preserve TTR and its functions or knockdown and drastically reduce TTR. This review summarizes the vital physiologic roles of TTR in health and disease. We consider the potential effects on normal biologic pathways that may occur while therapeutically suppressing TTR and discuss clinical decisions concerning ATTR therapies in the context of the summarized literature.\n\nDISCUSSION: TTR is essential for a broad range of physiologic processes and may confer clinically protective effects in neurologic and other organ systems. While a link between low TTR and severe disease and mortality is well established, it remains unclear whether long-term TTR suppression\n\nCONCLUSION: TTR serves vital physiologic roles across organ systems. Given its clinically protective properties, continued investigation into the potential long-term impact of TTR suppression"

Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on DEMAGs. The PPI protein interaction network and machine learning were applied to identify Hub genes, which were also validated by GSE46474, an external validation set. We constructed a rat model of acute rejection of kidney transplantation and sequenced the transcriptome of the serum, and using the sequencing results, we analyzed the expression levels of the Hub gene. Then, a correlation analysis was carried out based on the Hub genes and different immune cell infiltration levels. Finally, GRNdb, miRDB, and GeneCards databases were applied to study the transcription factors, miRNAs, and regulatory drugs of Hub genes, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: The results of the Cibersort analysis revealed that M2-type macrophages were expressed higher in the Normal group. In addition, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the expressions of Hub genes were negatively correlated with M1-type macrophages and positively correlated with M2-type macrophages.\n\nCONCLUSION: A diagnostic model of the macrophage-associated acute renal transplant rejection in peripheral blood was constructed based on CCR2 and TLR3, which can accurately diagnose the biological alterations of acute kidney transplant rejection.

In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections."

Participants were classified into two groups based on the timing of delivery: PE-delivery (delivery within 1 week of sample collection) and PE-non-delivery (no delivery within 1 week). Urine and serum samples were collected at the time of PE diagnosis, and cases were classified based on the presence of maternal or fetal complications.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 53 singleton pregnancies were analyzed and classified into the PE-delivery (n = 32) and PE-non-delivery groups (n = 21). No significant differences in L-FABP levels were observed between severe and non-severe PE cases. However, L-FABP levels were significantly higher in cases of severe PE due to maternal factors. In the PE-delivery group, urine and serum L-FABP levels were significantly elevated in cases requiring delivery within 1 week due to maternal indications compared to the PE-non-delivery group, whereas no such differences were found in cases with fetal indications. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed strong predictive performance of L-FABP levels for delivery within 1 week due to maternal deterioration, with areas under the curve of 0.892 (urine, cutoff: 12.3 μg/gCr) and 0.795 (serum, cutoff: 1.64 ng/mL).\n\nCONCLUSION: Maternal urine and serum L-FABP levels are closely associated with PE severity due to maternal complications and may serve as reliable biomarkers for imminent maternal deterioration."

    "text": "The human gut microbiome impacts host health through metabolite production, notably short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from digestion-resistant carbohydrates (DRCs). While DRC supplementation offers a means to modulate the microbiome therapeutically, its effectiveness is often limited by the microbial community's complexity and individual variability in microbiome functionality. We utilized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from the AGORA collection to provide a system-level overview of the metabolic capabilities of human gut microbes in terms of carbohydrate trophic networks and propose improved therapeutic interventions, based on microbial community design. Our study inferred the capability of AGORA strains to consume carbohydrates of varying structural complexities - including DRCs - and to produce metabolites amenable to cross-feeding, such as SCFAs. The resulting functional database indicated that DRC-degrading abilities are rare among gut microbes, suggesting that the presence or absence of specific taxa can determine the success of DRC-based interventions. Additionally, we found that metabolite production profiles exceed family-level variation, highlighting the limitations in predicting intervention outcomes based on gut microbial composition assessed at higher taxonomic levels. In response to these findings, we integrate reverse ecology principles, network analysis and GEM community modeling to guide the design of minimal yet resilient microbial communities to better guarantee intervention response (purpose-based communities). As a proof of principle, we predicted a purpose-based community designed to enhance butyrate production when used in conjunction with DRC supplementation that displays resilience under nutritional stress, such as amino acid restriction. We further seeded the identified purpose-based community into modeled human microbiomes previously demonstrated to accurately predict SCFA production profiles. The analysis confirmed that such intervention significantly promotes butyrate production across samples, with those that presented a comparatively lower butyrate production pre-intervention displaying the largest increase in butyrate production after seeding. Our work highlights the potential of combining GEMs with community design to infer effective microbiome interventions, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes."

This study examined the relationship between umbilical cord blood levels of angiopoietin-like protein 7 (ANGPTL7) in term neonates born to mothers with GDM and myocardial development, assessing its potential as an early predictive marker.\n\nMETHODS: The study involved 46 newborns exposed to GDM and 46 healthy controls. Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness. In the poorly-controlled GDM subgroup (GDM-A), neonates had significantly higher ANGPTL7 levels and IVS/LVPW ratio (1.19 vs. 1.03), indicating more severe myocardial abnormalities.\n\nCONCLUSION: ANGPTL7 may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy in GDM neonates by promoting insulin resistance. Monitoring ANGPTL7 levels in umbilical cord blood could help identify high-risk neonates and guide optimal glycaemic management during pregnancy. Although the sample size was small, the study offers new evidence of ANGPTL7's clinical utility.

    "text": "Adynamic bone disorder, common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), results from reduced bone turnover, often due to medications such as calcimimetics or high-dose vitamin D analogs that induce low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Numerous factors contributing to PTH hyporesponsiveness, which also induces low bone turnover, include deficient PTH, uremic toxins like indoxyl sulfate, malnutrition, inflammation, and diabetes. Diagnosis typically involves bone biopsy, although it is inconvenient. Biomarkers like bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and intact PTH (iPTH) show promise in distinguishing between low and high bone turnover. Meta-analysis suggests that levels of iPTH below 150 pg/mL or BALP levels below 20 μg/l indicate low bone turnover. Treatments aim to improve bone density without hindering repair, with osteo-anabolic medications being favored for low PTH levels and anti-resorptive agents being cautioned. Romosozumab, while effective, has safety concerns that limit its use. Uremic toxins are reduced by AST-120 treatment, which alleviates PTH hypo-responsiveness and bone toxicity. Adjunctive measures include addressing vitamin D deficiency, and diabetes, and utilizing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. Overall, BALP and iPTH appear as potential promising biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring adynamic bone disorder in CKD, effectively guiding therapeutic interventions."

In multivariable analyses, DD was associated with the composite outcome (HR 3.37, 95% CI: 2.03-5.59, P < .001). Ninety-seven patients (11.3%) had DD. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that older age at catheterization, greater body mass index (BMI), nonleft ventricular morphology, and higher ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) were associated with DD.\n\nCONCLUSION: DD, defined as an EDP >13 mm Hg, is linked to over 3-fold higher risk of adverse outcomes. Risk factors for DD include older age, higher BMI, nonleft ventricular morphology, and larger EDV. The presence of risk factors may warrant screening catheterization to identify DD and modify care accordingly."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (APAP) is a widely used antipyretic and analgesic agent, and acute exposure can lead to renal injury. Sesamin (Ses) is known for its various health benefits. However, it remains unclear whether Ses exerts a protective effect against APAP-induced kidney injury.\n\nMETHODS: In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with Ses and injected intraperitoneally with APAP. In vitro, human kidney proximal tubule cells 2 were pretreated with Ses, and then models of kidney injury induced by APAP were established. Kidney damage was evaluated by morphological, inflammation, oxidative stress and protein analyzes.\n\nRESULTS: Ses significantly improved APAP-induced nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo models. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in ferroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways, identifying heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) as a core protein. In the Ses-treated group, ferroptosis and apoptosis were significantly inhibited, while HMOX1 was effectively restored. In cell experiments, both the HMOX1 agonist hemin and Ses attenuated ferroptosis and apoptosis. HMOX1 inhibitor Zinc Protoporphyrin significantly eliminated the protective effect of Ses.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ses alleviates APAP-induced renal injury by mediating the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis via HMOX1. This study provides a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of drug-induced renal injury."

Living organisms undergo the ageing process simultaneously with their growth and development, characterized by constant cell division that leads to a decrease in the telomeric region of the chromosome. An active telomerase enzyme that adds a sequence of nucleotides to telomeres can keep them from shortening. The telomerase enzyme, on the other hand, is generally not active in skin cells due to constrained regulation. Research has demonstrated that anti-ageing drugs under development can activate the telomerase enzyme. The study used a computer-based method to examine how well patchouli plant parts could work as telomerase enzyme activators in cells' metabolic pathways. This research uses an in silico approach with three primary methods: network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. According to the network pharmacology study, the compounds found in the patchouli plant parts can turn on the telomerase enzyme through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Compounds in the patchouli plant activate the AKT1, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 proteins. These proteins are part of the telomerase enzyme activation pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics analyses show that patchouli plant compounds bind well to each protein, implying that the patchouli plant can activate telomerase. Both in vitro and in vivo tests are required to verify these findings."

    "text": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are often designed to not only bind targets via their antigen-binding domains (Fabs) but to also engage with cell surface receptors, FcγRs and FcRn, through their Fc regions, which may result in a variety of functional outcomes, including antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and alteration of circulating half-lives. Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs."

This study explores the non-linear relationship between the metabolic equivalent of recreational physical activity (MET-RPA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and depressive symptoms, assessing hs-CRP's mediating role.\n\nMETHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2020 were used, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores, hs-CRP, and PA data. Restricted cubic spline models analyzed non-linear relationships, and mediation analysis assessed the mediating role of hs-CRP.\n\nRESULTS: MET-RPA exhibited a non-linear \"U\" shaped relationship with depressive symptoms, where increased MET-RPA initially reduced depressive symptoms risk until a lowest point (3072.96 MET-min/week; i.e., 375 min of vigorous exercise or 750 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week), beyond which the risk increased. A non-linear \"L\" shaped relationship was observed between MET-RPA and CRP, with a lowest point of 3888.24 MET-min/week. Furthermore, a significant inflexion point was identified at a CRP level of 9.85 mg/L, where depressive symptoms risk increased with rising CRP levels but at a slower rate beyond this point. Mediation analysis revealed that CRP significantly mediated the relationship between MET-RPA and depressive symptoms, accounting for 8.14 % of the total effect.\n\nCONCLUSION: Moderate levels of RPA significantly reduce depressive symptoms, while excessive RPA slightly increases the risk of depression. The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise, represented by decreased hs-CRP levels, plays a partial but significant mediating role in the relationship between RPA and depression."

The present study aimed to determine the gene expression profiles of the cytochrome 450 3 A family of genes, CYP2C8, multidrug resistance 1 and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), through the comparisons of patients with steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS), using the prediction of miRNAs as a prognostic biomarker. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to identify gene expression patterns in each group, and the Gene Expression Omnibus database was used to predict groups of genes with co-expression patterns. Moreover, a network-based interaction analysis was performed using Human Protein Atlas and STRING databases, to identify the specific gene group involved in NS. MiRDB was also used to determine the specific miRNA associated with the aforementioned gene groups. Results of the present study demonstrated that male patients were more susceptible to NS development. Moreover, in both males and females in the SRNS group, NR3C1, CYP2C8, CYP3A7, CYP3A5 and CYP3A4(statistically insignificant) were upregulated. In addition, results of the present study revealed 10 unique hub miRNAs in the SRNS group that exhibited potential as gene targets for above genes. Collectively, results of the present study may provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying NS development, which may aid in the development of personalized therapeutic strategies."

Existing models exhibit limitations in accurately predicting tumor drug resistance and identifying resistance-associated genes. Furthermore, they often fail to effectively integrate multidimensional omics data and pathway-level information, lacking biological interpretability.\n\nMETHODS: We propose GC-PGE (Gene Correlation and Pathway Graph Encoder Network), a novel deep learning model to predict tumor drug resistance and identify core resistance genes. First, leveraging graph neural network, we constructed a gene correlation network incorporating protein interactions, gene homology, and signaling pathway data. We then integrated the tasks of drug-resistant gene prediction and tumor sample classification into a unified network architecture using a Bayesian learning approach, enabling mutual validation and enhancement between the tasks. Additionally, we developed a pathway graph encoder. This module employed graph structure to encode gene feature weights, simultaneously classifying tumor sample drug resistance and extracting core resistance genes along with their characteristic pathways.\n\nRESULT: GC-PGE significantly outperformed traditional models including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), and naive Bayes model (NBM) in predicting tumor drug resistance. It also demonstrated superior performance over baseline models including differential expression (DE), mutual information (MI), and random forest (RF) in identifying resistance-associated genes. Furthermore, GC-PGE elucidated key signaling pathways and core resistance genes associated with drug resistance in liver cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma, providing valuable mechanistic insights.\n\nCONCLUSION: By integrating multidimensional biological data and signaling pathway information, GC-PGE provides an effective framework for predicting tumor drug resistance and pinpointing core resistance genes. The model not only enhances prediction accuracy but also improves interpretability, thus positioning it as a promising approach for advancing personalized cancer therapy and novel therapeutic target discovery."

However, the implementation of unique manufacturing processes may result in the observation of new impurities. When new impurities are identified, comprehensive characterization of these species is needed to understand the potential impact to the safety and efficacy of the product. In this study, the assessment of a unique purification mode, protein L affinity chromatography, for purification of a bsAb resulted in high levels of free light chain (LC) in the final product. It was discovered that the free LC formed oligomers of various sizes upon accelerated stress in a concentration-, time-, and temperature-dependent manner. This is the first time free LC oligomer has been reported as a product-related impurity. Characterization of the free LC and free LC oligomer species was performed using a variety of chromatographic, electrophoretic, and mass spectrometry tools to gain insight on the formation and behavior of these impurities in the product.

Furthermore, the use of RCS models revealed a negative linear exposure-response gradient of diet quality scores in the odds of sleep disturbance and stroke. The WQS regression also demonstrated a beneficial impact of dietary composition on sleep disturbance and stroke, with high-quality protein, fish, nuts and fiber being the food groups that contributed most significantly to health across different dietary indices.\n\nCONCLUSION: Whichever dietary pattern is referred, low-quality diets are linked with a high odds of sleep disturbance and stroke.

This study aims to compare the performance of two widely used Ki-67 antibody clones, MIB1 and SP6, and to evaluate their impact on molecular subtyping in breast cancer. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from 35 primary breast carcinoma cases were stained using MIB1 and SP6 antibodies. Histological tumor characteristics and receptor statuses were evaluated for each case. The Ki-67 proliferative index was assessed following the latest recommendations of the International Ki-67 in Breast Cancer Working Group. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation, paired t-test, Welch's ANOVA, and McNemar's test. A strong correlation was observed between Ki-67 indices obtained using MIB1 and SP6 (r = 0.755, p < 0.001), with no statistically significant difference in mean values (p = 0.288). Ki-67 index correlated significantly with tumor grade for both antibodies. Among Luminal HER2-negative tumors, 17 % showed discordant molecular subtyping between MIB1 and SP6 using a 20 % cut-off. Similar discrepancies were observed at 14 % and 25 % cut-offs, suggesting that antibody choice may affect subtype classification. In conclusion, both MIB1 and SP6 provide reliable assessment of proliferative index in breast carcinoma, however, discrepancies in individual cases may impact molecular subtyping and subsequent clinical decision-making. Therefore, reporting the antibody clone used in Ki-67 evaluation may be advisable, pending further validation."

DNA damage repair (DDR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. The aim of this study was to identify core DDR genes involved in IFP progression and to assess their diagnostic potential and immunological relevance.\n\nMETHODS: Utilizing Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and previous research, we obtained publicly available IPF disease data and DDR gene set data. Through WGCNA, LASSO, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, we identified DDR-related hub genes, which were subsequently validated using external validation sets. ROC analysis was employed to assess and identify IPF diagnostic markers. Immune microenvironment of IPF group and its correlation with diagnostic genes were evaluated by ssGSEA algorithm and Spearman correlation analysis. Potential miRNAs and functional genes regulating diagnostic genes were predicted utilizing Network Analyst and GeneMANIA platforms.\n\nRESULTS: We identified HMGB2 and PRPF19 as diagnostic markers for IPF, both of which exhibited excellent diagnostic performance across three datasets. Comparisons at both single-cell and transcriptome levels revealed that HMGB2 was overexpressed in IPF, while PRPF19 was underexpressed. Immune microenvironment assessments indicated high infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in IPF group, suggesting presence of an inflammatory fibrotic immune microenvironment. Correlation analysis showed that various immune cells in IPF immune microenvironment were significantly associated with HMGB2 and PRPF19, indicating that these genes may influence immune microenvironment.\n\nCONCLUSION: By combining WGCNA and LASSO analyses, this study identified two hub genes, HMGB2 and PRPF19, that can serve as diagnostic markers for IPF and modulate its immune microenvironment. This finding provides new directions for clinical diagnosis of IPF and research into DDR-related mechanisms."

However, it remains unclear how preclinical findings translate to humans. Moreover, optimal TfR binding affinity remains a subject of debate. Model-informed drug discovery and development is a powerful approach that has been successfully used to support research and development. The goal of this analysis was to expand a published brain minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to investigate the optimal TfR binding affinity for maximal brain delivery in NHP and to facilitate prediction of the PK of anti-TfR bsAbs in humans from NHP data. Literature data for plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain exposure after administration of non-TfR mAbs and monovalent bsAbs with respect to TfR in NHP were used to develop the TfR mPBPK model. Clinical validation using human PK data from plasma and CSF for the monovalent anti-TfR bsAb trontinemab demonstrated good predictive performance without major model recalibration. The availability of the TfR mPBPK model is envisaged to provide better understanding of the relationship between TfR binding affinity, dose, and brain exposure, which would lead to more robust selection of lead candidates and efficacious dosing regimens."

In transplanted kidneys, IL-2RB is predominantly expressed elevated in T cells from rejection samples and is associated with decreased renal function. 10 hub genes were identified based on T cells with high and low expression of IL-2RB, of which NGboost reached AUC 0.77. The SHAP method obtained the gene with the greatest model contribution: the IL-2RB gene.\n\nCONCLUSION: NAAG plays a protective role in graft dysfunction, and part of the effect is mediated by inhibition of IL-2RB, which is verified as an important gene that functions in transplant kidney rejection. NAAG and IL-2RB may be novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets for graft dysfunction."

Microcephaly, hydrocephalus, ocular deformations, and meningoencephalitis characterize this disease. The plaque assay is the gold standard used in scientific research laboratories to quantify the virus titer on a sample and assess their relationship with the infectious dosage. However, it requires costly infrastructure and specialized technical training. In this study, a nano-immunosensor based on gold nanoparticles was developed to detect Zika virus using FTIR spectroscopy. Three calibration curves were established to estimate ZIKV titers by measuring the intensity of absorption bands associated with functional groups in viral samples at different concentrations. The detection sensitivity ranged from 5 × 10⁴ to 5 × 10⁷ PFU/mL for the lipid group (CO, 1750 cm⁻¹), 5 × 10 ³ to 5 × 10⁷ PFU/mL for the protein group (amide I, 1680 cm⁻¹), and 5 × 10⁵ to 2.2 × 10⁸ PFU/mL for the carbohydrate group (C-O, 860 cm⁻¹).

We aim to explore the potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of TLS in IgA nephropathy by bioinformatics methods, hoping to provide treatment methods. The datasets GSE226840, GSE237120, and GSE116626 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed to investigate the potential therapeutic targets of TLS in IgAN. The R was used to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of three datasets, and the Venny was used to intersect the above three parts of the DEGs to obtain the common DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on obtained genes using Metascape. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The intersection of the above common differential genes and IgAN differential genes was obtained by Venny tool. The Nephroseq platform was used to screen core genes and explore their relationship with clinical features. Meanwhile, CIBERSORT was utilized to further delve into the correlation between core genes and immune cells. 92 TLS-related genes and 486 IgAN related genes were obtained, and 6 common genes were obtained after crossing the two genes. The intersection genes were verified by Nephroseq, and CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6, and CD48 were identified as core genes. At the same time, there were differences in the composition of immune cells between the disease group and the control group when the immune infiltration analysis was performed. And by further analyzing the correlation between core genes and immune cells, the study found that the four genes were positively correlated with T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and other immune cells. By exploring the relationship between core genes and clinical features, CDKN1A and DUSP6 were negatively correlated with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and positively correlated with proteinuria in IgAN patients. CD48 was negatively correlated with GFR and positively correlated with Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). The four genes highly associated with TLS and IgAN were screened using GEO database in study. And CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6 and CD48 may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TLS in IgAN. At the same time, studies have found that T cells, B cells, and macrophages may be involved in the formation of TLS in IgAN."

However, this approach may compromise chirality-dependent therapeutic efficacy and potentially underestimate the significance of chirality in nanomedicine. Herein, supramolecular chiral nanoparticles, D/L-arginine (Arg)-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (TCPP), were constructed through the self-assembly of D/L-Arg and TCPP. Owing to the interaction between D/L-Arg and TCPP, chirality transfer from D/L-Arg to TCPP was observed, which resulted in the direct chiral induction of TCPP within supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, driven by enantioselective interaction with proteins, D-Arg-TCPP demonstrated 1.5-fold greater cellular uptake efficiency than L-Arg-TCPP via caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Thus, the enantiomer-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capacity-induced photodynamic anti-tumor performance, with D-Arg-TCPP exhibiting 1.9 times higher efficacy than L-Arg-TCPP, was verified. Our findings not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying chirality-dependent behavior of porphyrin-based supramolecular assemblies, but also pave a new avenue for optimizing chirality-mediated cancer therapy."

A nomogram was constructed in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort.\n\nRSEULTS: The training and validation cohorts included 696 and 275 patients, respectively. The nomogram incorporated blood plateletlevels, total protein, tumor location, tumor size, mitotic count, tumor rupture, Ki-67 index, and gene mutations. The C-index and AUC were 0.758 and 0.781 in the training cohort and 0.841 and 0.755, respectively, in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA curves confirmed favorable discrimination, calibration accuracy, and clinical benefits. Using the nomogram, patients were categorized into a general high-risk groupand a very high-risk group. Among the general high-risk group, no significant difference in RFS was observed between patients who received adjuvant imatinib for 2.5 years or longer. Conversely, in the very high-risk group, patients receiving adjuvant imatinib for five or more years had markedly improved RFS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the largest nomogram-related multicenter study in high-risk GIST, the nomogram accurately predicted RFS in patients with high-risk GIST and provided guidance on adjuvant therapy for the first time. For general high-risk patients, 3 years of adjuvant imatinib is adequate, whereas very high-risk patients benefit significantly from more than 5 years of adjuvant imatinib."

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development. In light of these findings, current nutritional strategies should be seriously reconsidered and recommended protein intakes for children must be urgently reevaluated."

Using the Ancestral and BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 strains as model systems, we developed the Q-NAb IgG Test for the quantitative determination of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants, traceable to WHO International Standards. The test utilizes a novel Fusion Protein that mimics the Spike receptor binding domain docked to the human ACE2 protein and effectively blocks non-neutralizing antibodies in the sample. After pre-blocking samples with Fusion Protein, direct binding of the residual neutralizing antibodies to variant RBDs coated in the wells of the microtiter plate is measured with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Results of the Q-NAb IgG Test agree with a live-virus microneutralization assay for both the Ancestral strain (WA1-2020) and the Omicron BA.5 (COR-22-063113/2022) variant (Spearman's correlation, ρ = 0.87 and 0.92, respectively). The analytical performance (sensitivity, linearity, precision, and interference) of the Q-NAb IgG Test was established along with specificity using a panel of monoclonal neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clinical sensitivity and specificity using pre-pandemic, convalescent, and vaccinated serum and plasma samples is also reported.

This study employs an integrated computational approach to identify inhibitors of IrtAB, a critical iron transporter in Mtb, leveraging structure-based drug design to overcome existing resistance mechanisms. Virtual screening of 201,544 compounds from the ZINC20 database was performed using defined drug-likeness criteria (MW 300-350 Da, LogP 1-3.5, neutral charge at pH 7.4), followed by molecular docking. Three lead compounds demonstrated high-affinity binding to IrtAB's histidine-rich substrate pocket (His356/402/407): ZINC000225478236 (DPTU, -8.55 kcal/mol), featuring a triazole-urea scaffold; ZINC000038021820 (DMPA-HCl, -8.18 kcal/mol), with optimized morpholine-propylamino acid pharmacophores; and ZINC000004689680 (TMSPI, -8.16 kcal/mol), a spirocyclic indole derivative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of top candidates revealed significant correlations between binding affinity (S) and molecular descriptors (R²=0.819 for PCA1). Molecular dynamics simulations (50 ns, OPLS3e force field) confirmed complex stability, with DMPA-HCl showing superior rigidity (RMSD <0.8 Å). Comprehensive ADMET profiling using SwissADME and ProTox-3.0 predicted favorable pharmacokinetics (Lipinski compliance, high GI absorption) and low toxicity risks for DMPA-HCl (hepatotoxicity probability=0.61). While these computational results identify promising IrtAB inhibitors, key limitations include the relatively short duration of MD simulations (50 ns), which may not fully capture long-term protein-ligand interaction dynamics, and the lack of experimental validation to confirm the biological efficacy and safety of the candidate compounds. This work establishes a rational foundation for developing novel antitubercular agents targeting iron acquisition, with DMPA-HCl emerging as the prime candidate for further optimization."

The majority of A1M is present in the blood in free form and in a bound form with IgA dimers, with the free form thought to have antioxidant capacity. However, the dynamics of A1M in chronic kidney disease patients being susceptible to oxidative stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the profile and changes in A1M resulting from blood purification in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) (including hemodiafiltration). Eighteen patients on stable maintenance HD were included in the study. For analysis, residual serum samples were collected from these patients during routine blood tests. A1M was measured using a latex agglutination immunoassay. The abundance of the free and bound forms of A1M was determined by native PAGE. The A1M concentration was 91.58 ± 26.34 mg/L, the percentage of free A1M was 72.62 ± 20.02%. The pre- and postdialysis mean concentration of free A1M were 68.74 ± 29.78 and 52.13 ± 22.48 mg/L, respectively. The mean reduction rate in free A1M after blood purification treatment was 20.49 ± 20.91%, showing the significant difference between pre- and postdialysis concentrations. The predialysis mean concentration of protein-bound A1M was 22.85 ± 15.16 mg/L, with a postdialysis concentration of 24.73 ± 12.82 mg/L. The novel finding of this study is that A1M in patients on maintenance HD exists pre-dominantly in the free form and can be effectively removed by hemodialysis."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: The consumption of sports drinks before, during, and after endurance exercise is a common practice among athletes. These drinks typically contain a variety of components, each of which has been shown to offer individual benefits. However, the combined effects of these components, as formulated in many sports drinks, have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to evaluate the impact of typical sports drink components on endurance performance, perceived exertion, and carbohydrate and fat metabolism, using a sequential additive design.\n\nMETHODS: Twelve healthy, trained endurance athletes aged 20 to 35 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study involved a baseline assessment and four exercise protocols, each separated by a 7-day washout period. During each exercise protocol, participants cycled for 40 minutes at 80% of their previously determined peak oxygen uptake , followed by an incremental protocol performed to voluntary exhaustion. Participants were randomly assigned to ingest one of four 300 ml solutions 60 and 30 minutes before each exercise protocol: solution A (placebo mineral water), solution B (dextrose and sodium), solution C (solution B + beetroot extract), or solution D (solution C + arginine and L-citrulline). Ventilation and heart rate were continuously monitored before and throughout the exercise. Lactate and glucose levels were measured at specific time points before and during the exercise, while ratings of perceived exertion were recorded every 10 minutes. Power output was continuously tracked throughout the exercise protocol. Body weight was assessed both before and after each exercise session.\n\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the four solutions in terms of time to exhaustion (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of the tested sports drink compositions on performance during the selected exercise protocol to voluntary exhaustion appears minimal. This study found no significant differences between the solutions and the placebo. Thus, it can be concluded that consuming a dextrose-based solution before exercise did not offer any performance advantage over water. The additional substances included in solutions B, C, and D did not influence performance, carbohydrate metabolism, or fat metabolism during the exercise."

While apelin peptides are promising therapeutic candidates due to their critical role in vascular homeostasis, their efficacy as agonists is limited by insufficient lesion-specific targeting and suboptimal in vivo stability. Here, we developed an engineered extracellular vesicle (EV) platform for precise apelin delivery to PAH lesions, maximizing therapeutic impact. Using interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a type II transmembrane protein, we oriented the apelin peptide on the EV surface with its C-terminus fully exposed, preserving the critical binding interface for functional interaction with the apelin receptor. To further enhance targeting specificity, we integrated the PAH-targeting peptide CARSKNKDC (CAR), which selectively binds to heparan sulfate overexpressed on PAH endothelial cells, into the IFITM3-apelin scaffold, creating CAR-Apelin EVs. This dual-engineered EVs demonstrated exceptional targeting and therapeutic efficacy in PAH models. CAR-Apelin EVs significantly reversed pathological vascular remodeling and improved cardiac function, as evidenced by reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy. Our findings establish CAR-Apelin EVs as a transformative therapeutic strategy, providing a targeted and effective approach to meet critical unmet needs in PAH treatment."

Nevertheless, its role in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains to be elucidated.\n\nMETHODS: We identified the differentially expressed genes in the glomeruli of IgAN patients through weighted gene co-expression network analysis across three datasets. Through clinical renal pathological tissue and cellular experiments, we further validated the gene and investigated its relationship with the inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to peritumoral normal tissues, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling pathway have been identified as key elements in IgAN pathogenesis from two GEO databases and a validation dataset. PCK1 was identified and validated as one of the most promising candidate genes. The expression of PCK1 in clinically collected kidney specimens was significantly downregulated in patients with IgAN compared to healthy controls. The expression of PCK1 was inversely correlated with clinical indicators such as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-hour proteinuria. In experiments with SV40-transformed mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MCs), PCK1 and PPARγ protein expression levels were significantly decreased in polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1)-stimulated MCs, which contrasts with the increased expression of inflammatory and fibrotic factors. Overexpression of PCK1 inhibited cellular inflammation and fibrotic changes induced by pIgA1, demonstrating protective effects against cellular fibrosis similar to rosiglitazone.\n\nCONCLUSION: PCK1 exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on mesangial cell inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN, potentially offering a novel therapeutic target for its treatment."

Gliadin, a component of gluten, triggers oxidative stress in celiac disease. Using sensitive analytical methods, especially in foods containing high amounts of these proteins, is crucial for food safety. Aptamer-based biosensors are widely preferred in electroanalytical methods. One of the promising approaches regarding biosensors is the studies in which aptamer-based sensors are combined with molecularly imprinted polymers. The antibody-like binding and ability of MIP to distinguish between molecules increases the method's selectivity. Using a platform modified with aptamer and molecularly imprinted polymer hybrid (MIP) as a new synthetic receptor film, this study presents a selective and sensitive label-free aptasensor for detecting a food allergy gliadin. For this purpose, screen printed gold electrode was used. The electrode surface was electrochemically coated with gold nanoparticles to bind the aptamer to the surface; then the aptamer-gliadin complex was dripped onto the surface and adhered to it, then, o-phenylene diamine monomer was used to synthesize a MIP surface. Gliadin was determined by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in a wide range from 0.25 fg/mL to 1000 pg/mL. The developed method calculated LOD for gliadin determination as 0.011 fg/mL and LOQ as 0.034 fg/mL. The devised aptasensor was not only capable to the discrimination of the commonly found allergen compounds such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, and ara-H1, but also it could detect the gliadin in spiked real samples such as gluten-free bread, crackers, cookies and brown rice cakes samples in the high recovery range of 98.1-104.6 %. The method could be a promising candidate for the sensitive determination of several allergens in food sample analysis."

Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17.0, with effect sizes expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 18 RCTs involving 1,497 patients were analyzed. Combination therapy significantly improved total effective rate (TER) (MD 2.61, 95% CI 1.62-2.64) and reduced key renal and metabolic markers. Urinary protein excretion rate (UPER), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 24-hour urinary protein (24h-UTP), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels all significantly decreased in the combination group. Subgroup analysis showed that patients aged ≤55 years had greater reductions in SCr (WMD -25.62, 95% CI -29.41 to -21.83) and BUN (WMD -2.51, 95% CI -2.75 to -2.27). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of findings. No publication bias was detected for TER, SCr, BUN, 24h-UTP, TG, and adverse reactions, though UPER and TC showed potential bias.\n\nCONCLUSION: SKI combined with RAAS blockers may enhance renal function and metabolic profiles in DN patients. Further high-quality RCTs are needed to validate these findings and assess long-term safety."

In vivo, renal function was assessed via serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance measurements, alongside histopathological evaluation of renal fibrosis and inflammation. In vitro, hypoxia-treated HK-2 cells were analyzed for fibrotic markers (fibronectin, collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18). Molecular mechanisms were probed through protein expression analysis of HIF-1α and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, with NLRP3 inflammasome activity evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: SSR treatment significantly improved renal function in CRF rats, reducing serum creatinine (Scr) and urea nitrogen (BUN) while enhancing creatinine clearance.

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Inflammation and oxidative stress are important pathological processes of contrast-induced acute renal injury (CIAKI). This study explored whether DMF had therapeutic effects and investigated the underlying mechanism in CIAKI.\n\nMETHODS: A CIAKI animal model was established in C57BL/6J mice with iohexol, and DMF was used as an intervention.\n\nRESULTS: DMF improved the renal function of CIAKI model mice. Enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched mostly in the acute phase response and the JAK-STAT pathway. The results revealed that inflammation, ERS and pyroptosis increased in the CIAKI group but decreased after DMF treatment. Further study revealed that the JAK2-STAT3 pathway was overactivated\n\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that DMF had renoprotective effects on CIAKI. DMF ameliorated pyroptosis through the inhibition of ERS and the JAK2-STAT3 pathway."

This vaccine is based on a recombinant subunit protein platform, with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) as its target antigen. The study compared the candidate's safety and immunogenicity to the control group vaccine, the Sinovac vaccine, 28 days after administration. This was an observer-blinded and randomized Phase 1 trial which recruited 175 subjects. The subject received 0.5 ml of vaccine in two doses. The subjects were split into five treatment groups, consisting of different combinations of doses between RBD and CpG. The safety of this vaccine was evaluated within 7 days after the first dose and for 6 months after the second dose, while the immunogenicity was evaluated on days 14 and 28 after the second dose. The overall incidence of AEs was 54.86% from the beginning of the vaccination to 28 days after each injection. Most AEs were local pain and had no serious AEs. The study revealed a significant rise in the Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) of IgG antibodies in every group, indicating a strong immune response. The phase I data demonstrated that the new vaccine candidate showed promising results in safety and immunogenicity."

Although extensive literature has been reported on Nectin-4, it is worth noting that no studies have yet systematically investigated the hotspots, cutting-edge directions, and tissue expression of this target using a combination of bibliometric analysis and bioinformatics methods. Findings reveal growing interest in Nectin-4's role in cancer immunotherapy and ADC development. Urothelial carcinoma remains the primary focus, with breast and bladder cancers gaining traction. Key research priorities include optimizing ADC safety profiles, particularly managing cutaneous adverse events. Notably, dual targeting strategies combining Nectin-4 with TROP-2 show promise for next-generation ADC therapies. The study highlights evolving clinical needs, from target validation to treatment optimization, positioning Nectin-4 as a versatile biomarker bridging multiple cancer research domains. These insights emphasize the protein's translational potential while underscoring the importance of balancing therapeutic efficacy with toxicity management in ADC development."

In this study, we developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 NP-RNA interaction. Using this HTRF-based approach, we identified two natural products, sennoside A and sennoside B, as effective blockers of this interaction. Bio-layer interferometry assays confirmed that both sennosides directly bind to the NP, with binding sites located within the C-terminal domain. Additionally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that sennoside B significantly inhibited RNA-induced LLPS of the NP, while sennoside A displayed comparatively weaker activity. Thus, the developed HTRF-based assay is a valuable tool for identifying novel compounds that disrupt the RNA-binding activity and LLPS of the SARS-CoV-2 NP. Our findings may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 NP."

The participants were randomly divided into a training set (711 people) and a validation set (305 people) at a ratio of 7:3. A risk prediction model was established according to the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration curve analysis, the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and decision curve analysis (DCA).\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis in patients on maintenance hemodialysis was 32%. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), catheterization history, hemodialysis duration, autologous arteriovenous fistula stenosis and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were independent risk factors for autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis. These five predictors were used to construct a predictive nomogram. The AUC was 0.818 in the training set and 0.826 in the validation set. The calibration curve of the nomogram was close to the standard curve, indicating that the model was well calibrated. The DCA results confirmed that the model provided good net clinical benefits.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, a predictive nomogram for arteriovenous fistula thrombosis was established and validated."

We recruited 178 women, including 73 who had experienced at least one early clinical pregnancy loss and 105 patients with one live birth and no history of pregnancy loss. Data on demographics, disease history, menstrual and reproductive history was collected. The case group patients were sampled immediately upon presenting with pregnancy loss at their first visit. The reference group patients underwent samples when they chose to participate voluntarily. All vaginal discharge was performed DNA Preparation and Metagenomics Sequencing. DNA extraction was performed using the phenol/trichloromethane method and the DNA fragments were then size-selected to 300-700 bp using magnetic beads. The selected fragments were repaired and ligated with indexed adaptors. The captured DNA was amplified again by PCR and circularized to create a single-stranded circular (ssCir) library. The ssCir library was subsequently amplified through rolling circle amplification (RCA) to produce DNA nanoballs (DNBs). The DNBs were then loaded onto a flow cell and sequenced using the DNBSEQ Platform. Nonparametric tests, including Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests, were employed. Relative abundance between groups was compared, and differential species selection was performed using the LEfSe software with linear discriminant analysis.\n\nRESULTS: 1. PCoA analysis based on Bray-Curtis distances at the species level revealed a difference between the groups (\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study highlights the association between vaginal microbiota dysbiosis and EPL, identifying specific microbial taxa that may contribute to pregnancy loss. These findings underscore the importance of the vaginal microbiome in reproductive health and open up new avenues for research into microbiome-based diagnostics and therapies.

Despite advancements in cancer therapies, challenges such as cellular toxicity and drug resistance to chemotherapy persist. Regulated cell death (RCD), once regarded as a passive process, is now recognized as a programmed mechanism with distinct biochemical and morphological characteristics, thereby presenting new therapeutic opportunities. Ferroptosis, a novel form of RCD characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and unique mitochondrial damage, differs from apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. It is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation and is implicated in tumorigenesis, anti-tumor immunity, and resistance, particularly in tumors undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ferroptosis is associated with ischemic organ damage, degenerative diseases, and aging, regulated by various cellular metabolic processes, including redox balance, iron metabolism, and amino acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism. This review focuses on the role of epigenetic factors in tumor ferroptosis, exploring their mechanisms and potential applications in cancer therapy. It synthesizes current knowledge to provide a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic regulation in tumor cell ferroptosis, offering insights for future research and clinical applications."

However, previous research shows they commonly experience suboptimal intakes of energy and carbohydrate. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the causes of their poor dietary intakes. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess infantry trainees' dietary intakes and (2) explore their beliefs, barriers, and self-efficacy toward performance nutrition using the Health Belief Model (HBM).\n\nMETHODS: Participants undergoing their 17-week Australian Army Infantry Initial Employment Training (Infantry IET) were recruited. During weeks 1 and 17, self-reported dietary intakes were assessed, and four focus groups were conducted.\n\nRESULTS: Mean daily energy, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were 7864 ± 1135 kJ, 1.8 ± 0.6 g/kg, and 1.5 ± 0.3 g/kg, respectively, in week 1, and 9084 ± 2535 kJ/day, 2.2 ± 1.1 g/kg and 1.5 ± 0.2 g/kg, respectively, in week 17. Three themes and seven subthemes were developed from the focus group data, falling under the following HBM domains: Cues to Action, Perceived Barriers, and Self-Efficacy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Infantry trainees' ability to eat well for their health and performance was hindered by their limited time during their intensive training schedule, their limited access to a sufficient variety of healthy foods, and their limited self-efficacy regarding performance nutrition. They require further performance nutrition knowledge, especially in regard to adopting practical fueling and refueling strategies surrounding physical training, as well as access to a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods outside of their main mealtimes."

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has categorized supplements based on scientific evidence regarding their efficacy and safety. Despite extensive global research on dietary supplement use among athletes, data on Polish athletes remain limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate supplement use among Polish athletes, considering their competitive level and gender. Additionally, it assessed whether athletes select supplements in accordance with the AIS classification and examined their awareness of supplement certification programs.\n\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 659 Polish athletes (309 women, 350 men) from various sports, representing both professional (57.7%) and nonprofessional (42.3%) levels. An online questionnaire was used to assess dietary supplement consumption, sources of information regarding supplementation, and knowledge of anti-doping and supplement certification programs. Supplement use was categorized according to the AIS classification (Groups A - D). Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and Mann - Whitney U tests, were conducted to evaluate differences between professional and nonprofessional athletes, as well as between male and female participants.\n\nRESULTS: A high prevalence of dietary supplement use (91.1%) was observed among Polish athletes, with no significant differences between professional (95.8%) and nonprofessional (94.3%) athletes or between men (92.0%) and women (90.0%). The most frequently consumed supplements were sports drinks (63.9%), electrolyte supplements (51.6%), and isolated protein supplements (54.6%), vitamin D (71.6%), vitamin C (59.8%), with significantly higher intake among professional athletes. Male athletes were more likely than females to consume caffeine (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the widespread use of dietary supplements among Polish athletes, irrespective of competitive level or gender. While many athletes select supplements from AIS Group A, their knowledge of AIS classification and supplement certification programs remains limited. The high reliance on social media for supplement information, combined with the lack of professional guidance, underscores the need for improved education on safe and effective supplementation practices. Given the risks associated with supplement contamination, targeted initiatives should enhance athletes' awareness of anti-doping regulations and certified supplement options."

It is categorized as ribosomopathy related to heterozygous allelic variations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a rare and etiologically heterogeneous condition, defined by the clinical triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We present a 5-year-and-2-month-old Chinese boy diagnosed with DBA combined with RPS. He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28. RPS28 is one of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes, which may contribute to DBA-related phenotypes.

    "text": "Patients presenting monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) and IgA vasculitis collectively have rarely been reported. This study reports one patient with monoclonal IgA and λ, and with IgA positive-mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis. The patient manifested slight chronic nephritic syndrome, and his serums tested positive for M protein (monoclonal IgA and λ). As a result of bone wear, the plasma cell ratio of these patients was confirmed to be mildly increased in peripheral blood smears. Just like typical IgA nephropathy or IgA vasculitis patients, serum poorly galactosylated IgA1 antibodies were found in the patient compared to the controls. The patient was diagnosed with mild mesangial proliferative IgA vasculitis based on renal biopsy. Besides, immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry confirmed immune deposits predominantly containing galactose-deficient IgA1 (GD-IgA1) and λ in the glomerular mesangium and the walls of the skin's blood vessels. The pathological findings support the hypothesis that monoclonal IgA, which originate from bone marrow plasma cells, rather than mucosally primed B cells, also may be galactose deficient. This may be a new pathological source of IgA-proliferative glomerulonephritis."

Body composition was measured using the InBody770 multi-frequency body composition analyzer. Plasma TMAO concentrations were assessed by ELISA. Cross-sectional analysis was performed after collecting demographic data, dialysis-related data, laboratory parameters, and body composition data from MHD patients.\n\nRESULTS: In MHD patients, the PEW group exhibited lower levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), transferrin (TF), creatinine (Cr), triglycerides (TG), prealbumin (PALB), soft lean mass (SLM), body mass index (BMI), percent of body fat (PBF), arm muscle circumference (AMC), and phase angle (PHA) compared to the non-PEW group, while C-reactive protein (CRP) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels, as well as Extracellular Water/Total Body Water (ECW/TBW) ratio, were higher in the PEW group than in the non-PEW group. After full adjustment, TMAO and ECW/TBW ratio were independent risk factors for PEW in MHD patients. Further, plasma TMAO levels correlated negatively with Cr, ALB, Hb, BMI, and PHA, and positively with ECW/TBW in MHD patients with PEW. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma TMAO in predicting PEW in MHD patients was 0.788.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma TMAO levels and certain body composition are associated with the occurrence of PEW in MHD patients. Plasma TMAO levels appear to serve as a potential predictive marker for the onset of PEW."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Rugby union is a high-contact team sport where professional rugby players are exposed to considerable training and game loads in pre-season and in-season. Some studies have shown that rugby players' dietary intake remains inadequate for the three macronutrients (carbohydrates [CHO], proteins and fats) required for optimal performance. This study aimed to describe the macronutrient intake of professional male rugby players at Zebre Rugby Club in Parma, Italy, during in-season, and to compare players' macronutrient intake to international recommendations.\n\nMETHODS: Thirty-four professional male rugby players participated in the cross-sectional study. A self-developed questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire and food records (on training and competition days and off day) were used to investigate players' macronutrient intake. Anthropometric measurements were obtained using the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized techniques. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations were investigated using chi-square, Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank tests as applicable.\n\nRESULTS: The players' median age was 25.8 years (range 20.6-33.0 years) and 47.5% were Italian. Most players (64.7%) held forward positions and had a median of 5 years (range 2-14 years) of professional experience. More than 75.0% of players lived with a spouse or partner and 30.3% earned between 4 000-4 999 euros per month. The median body weight and height of players were 106.9 kg and 186.3 cm, respectively. The forwards weighed heavier (\n\nCONCLUSION: The study's findings can assist various stakeholders at Zebre Rugby Club to align rugby players' dietary requirements to their workload, and encourage players' adherence to dietary guidelines and recommendations. It is advised that attention be focused on accurate dietary education, intake and monitoring to promote individualization and optimal performance and recovery. Future research is needed to adapt standardized macronutrient recommendations for rugby-specific requirements and address obstacles that may impede the optimal intake of macronutrients."

While extreme nighttime sleep duration is linked to glomerular injury by prior studies, its impact on tubular damage remains unclear. Given that 7-9 h of sleep per night is widely recommended for maintaining overall health, this study aimed to assess whether long nighttime sleep duration is associated with renal tubular damage using both observational and genetic evidence.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 2,683 adults in rural China to assess the link between nighttime sleep duration and renal tubular damage (measured by retinol-binding protein and β2-microglobulin). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the causal relationship between prolonged nighttime sleep duration and elevated kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels.\n\nRESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression indicated that sleeping more than 9 h per night was associated with a 1.38-fold increased risk of renal tubular damage (95% CI: 1.11-1.71) compared to 7-9 h of sleep, with particularly pronounced effects observed in elderly individuals and women. MR analysis further supported a causal relationship between genetically predicted long nighttime sleep duration and elevated KIM-1 levels (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide observational and genetic evidence linking prolonged nighttime sleep to increased renal tubular damage risk. Given that 7-9 h of sleep per night is the widely accepted recommendation for maintaining overall health, our results emphasize the potential risks of excessive sleep duration exceeding 9 h."

This group was compared to 26 consecutive patients with stable AVFs. Key parameters analyzed included dialysis efficiency (urea reduction ratio, blood flow rates, venous/arterial pressures) and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein [CRP]).\n\nRESULTS: L-TDCs remained in use for an average of 40.6 ± 27.5 months (range: upto 113 months). Despite similar dialysis efficiency between groups (urea reduction ratio: 72.5% vs. 68.5%,\n\nCONCLUSION: Although L-TDC users achieve comparable dialysis efficiency to AVF patients, they experience persistent inflammation, as indicated by significantly elevated CRP levels. These findings underscore the need for closer monitoring and strategies to mitigate long-term inflammatory risks in patients requiring prolonged catheter use."

This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of monocyte distribution width (MDW) in detecting sepsis in patients with HIV. A prospective observational study was conducted at Shanghai Public Health Center, involving 488 hospitalized patients with HIV aged 18-65 between December 2022 and August 2023. MDW was measured at admission, and its diagnostic accuracy was compared with Sepsis-3 criteria. Survival rates on day 28 and 90 were also recorded. Additionally, five machine learning (ML) models were tested to enhance diagnostic efficacy. Of 488 subjects, 90 were in the sepsis group and 398 in the control group. MDW showed a diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, comparable to C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) with AUCs of 0.78 and 0.82, respectively. With a cut-off value of 25.25, MDW had a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.76. The positive and negative predictive values were 44% and 95%, respectively. When MDW was combined with platelet count, serum albumin, and hemoglobin in a random forest model, the AUC improved to 0.931. The model achieved a sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 0.732. MDW is a useful diagnostic marker for sepsis in patients with HIV, with strong sensitivity and specificity. Combining MDW with other lab markers can further enhance diagnostic accuracy."

The structure-activity relationship (SAR) data on the amino acids, fatty acids, linkers and biological effects in vitro and in vivo of TRA01-24 have been summarized. Furthermore, peptide-protein molecular docking elucidated the structural basis for the biased agonist activity of TRA22 at GLP-1R, characterized by strong GLP-1R activation but weak GCGR and GIPR activation.

The model was trained following a pre-training-then-fine-tuning paradigm and was subsequently applied to identify new molecules with potential anti-orthopoxvirus activity. Notably, a cinnamoyl anthranilic acid derivative (compound 6) was successfully predicted and demonstrated potent anti-orthopoxvirus effects both in vitro and in vivo.

Selenium-enriched fresh noodles were prepared by selenium-enriched wheat flour. The results indicated that organic selenium in selenium-enriched wheat flour improved the viscoelasticity of dough. High selenium noodles (HSN) exhibited superior cooking quality compared to control (plain noodles, PN). In FT-IR analysis, organic selenium in selenium-enriched noodles may promote the development of protein ordered structure, enhancing CH stretching vibration and the forming hydrogen bonds with starch. Additionally, the in vitro digestion study revealed that HSN had the highest resistant starch (RS) content of 42.28 %, which was 12.37 % higher than that of PN. In sensory evaluation, HSN received the highest overall score. Therefore, using selenium-enriched wheat flour with an appropriate selenium content to make fresh noodles can enhance both the quality and health benefits of the noodles."

    "text": "Recent studies have confirmed the significant potential of the histamine H2 receptor (H2R) as a therapeutic target for multiple diseases, creating an urgent demand for efficient drug screening methodologies. To address this need, we developed an innovative technique utilizing immobilized H2R for the rapid identification and characterization of bioactive compounds from complex matrices. Compared with the previous screening methods, this approach can detect the binding mode of ligands on the basis of screening. In this study, the prepared H2R chromatographic column was successfully applied for kinetic interaction analysis between two specific ligands and the receptor. The bioactive compound screened and collected via the H2R column was identified as liquiritin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-IT-MS). Competitive displacement assays revealed that liquiritin competes with nizatidine and ranitidine for the same binding sites. Notably, as the concentration of famotidine in the mobile phase increased, an inverse shift in the retention time of liquiritin was observed. To elucidate this phenomenon, molecular docking simulations were performed. The results suggest that nizatidine and ranitidine compete with liquiritin for the same binding sites, reducing liquiritin-protein binding and increasing the proportion of free liquiritin, thereby causing a forward shift in the retention peak. In contrast, the acidic residues (ASP186, ASP98) of famotidine may reorganize the protein's surface charge through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, altering the electrostatic interactions of liquiritin and leading to the observed peak shift. Additionally, at higher concentrations, famotidine may form multimolecular complexes that indirectly stabilize liquiritin-protein binding. Literature review revealed that, compared to nizatidine and ranitidine, famotidine exhibits a positive regulatory effect on β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization. These findings further demonstrate that the established H2R receptor chromatography model can effectively screen bioactive components and determine their binding modes. This study lays the foundation for screening bioactive compounds from traditional Chinese medicines using receptor chromatography and provides preliminary insights into their mechanisms of action."

In this study, the effects of cold plasma (CP)-assisted alcalase treatment on the structure, digestibility and allergenicity of TM were investigated. The results showed that CP pretreatment promoted the hydrolysis of TM by unfolding the structure and reducing the spatial site resistance. Compared with native TM, CP-assisted alcalase protease-treated TM showed a significant decrease in α-helix content, along with an increase in irregular curl and free sulfhydryl content. CP-assisted alcalase significantly decreased the IgE and IgG binding capacities of TM compared to native TM (87.56 % and 47.59 %, respectively). Moreover, the reduced stability of trypsin digestion further inhibited allergic reactions induced by TM. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that extensive enzymatic cleavage sites were identified within alcalase including M11, L46, A109, L144, and A235 substantially compromised the integrity of TM antigenic epitopes. The amount of intact antigenic epitope peptides in the TM from CP-assisted hydrolysis was reduced by 164 compared to hydrolysis alone, revealing the mechanism of reduced allergenicity of TM. It can be concluded that CP-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis presents a promising novel strategy for desensitizing aquatic products."

Our findings revealed that kaempferol (KA) was highly effective in inhibiting HSA, while others like malvidin-3-glucoside (M3G) and ferulic acid (FA) showed varying degrees of efficacy. Their distinct inhibition kinetic modes, either competitive or mixed, could be interpreted by in silico molecular docking, which visualized interactions with both active and non-active site amino acid residues of HSA. Additionally, PP binding induced conformational changes in HSA, evidenced by a reduced enzyme intrinsic fluorescence. Further, saturation transfer difference - nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) revealed close interactions between specific parts of the PP's structure (e.g., aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups) and the enzyme surface, highlighting the key role of the structure-activity relationship. The binding epitopes aligned well with predicted binding poses, bridging experimental and computational approaches for a comprehensive understanding."

We prepared two fermented isolates using different starter cultures and one conventional control. Both cultures grew in the protein solution, primarily consuming sucrose naturally present in peas, while producing lactic acid, lowering pH to 4.8 in 4-7 h. The protein yield was unaffected by fermentation, but undesirable flavors were reduced, and bitterness decreased threefold. Powder solubility decreased by 20 %, but water absorption and foaming capacity increased twofold. Oil holding capacity, emulsion activity, protein surface hydrophobicity, and in vitro protein digestibility showed minimal changes.

Structural analysis revealed that CH-FA was formed spontaneously, driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The electron tongue results demonstrated that the bitter value of CH was reduced by 30.89 %, which may be due to the improvement of the hydrophobic amino acid microenvironment and the reduction of binding to the bitter receptor, thereby reducing the bitterness.

However, how shear forces affect protein molecular structure leading to pasta quality and the allergenicity of pasta is not well understood. This study explored the impact of varying screw speeds (150 rpm and 550 rpm), which directly influence specific mechanical energy (SME) input during extrusion, on protein molecular weight distribution, cooking properties, and starch and protein digestibility in both regular durum wheat pasta and gluten-enriched pasta. Pasta produced at 550 rpm exhibited reduced water absorption and cooking time but significantly increased cooking loss, accompanied by a decrease in disulphide bonds. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results indicated that high screw speed caused the insolubility of glutenins and globulins while increasing the solubility of gliadins. Additionally, these structural changes corresponded to decreased ionic and hydrogen bonding and increased hydrophobic interactions. Although starch and protein enzymic digestibility was decreased with added gluten, the increased screw speed enhanced their digestion. Proteomic mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS analysis) revealed a reduction in the number of identified proteins and allergens in the digestate of pasta produced at 550 rpm, while the number of identified peptides increased. Additionally, added gluten delayed protein hydrolysis during the gastric phase and offset differences due to screw speed. This understanding aids in optimizing processing and formulations, balancing efficiency with pasta's nutritional and cooking quality."

DKR was calculated using the formula: (0.9 × fat +0.46 × protein) / (0.1 × fat +0.58 × protein + carbohydrates). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for 19 confounders (demographics, comorbidities, lifestyle), restricted cubic splines, and mediation analyses. Robustness was assessed via propensity score matching.\n\nRESULTS: A higher DKR showed a linear dose-response reduction in depressive symptoms risk (OR = 0.13 per unit increase, 95 % CI:0.03-0.48, p = 0.003; Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 0.59, p = 0.012).. Mediation analyses revealed opposing effects: traditional obesity metrics (BMI, waist circumference, BRI) mediated adverse associations (-14.69 % to -11.43 %), while the body shape index (ABSI) displayed protective mediation (11.03 %, p < 0.001). None of the 12 inflammatory markers showed significant mediation, as indicated by p-values >0.05 or mediation proportions <5 %.\n\nCONCLUSION: DKR inversely associates with depressive symptoms risk, potentially through body composition remodeling rather than anti-inflammatory pathways. ABSI served as a positive mediator in the inverse association between DKR and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm causality and clinical utility of DKR."

Encouragingly, most of these compounds exhibited a selectivity index (SI) >3333.3 and CC₅₀ values >100 μg/mL against Vero cells, indicating they are over 3000 times more toxic to M. tuberculosis than to mammalian cells and demonstrate absence of cytotoxicity at concentrations effective against TB (MIC = 0.03 μg/mL). Among them, 12a, 14a, and 14d demonstrated remarkable activity against drug-resistant strains of Mtb with an MIC of 0.03 μM. Time-kill kinetic studies revealed that 12a, 14a, and 14d exhibited bacteriostatic properties. Furthermore, 12a, 14a, and 14d demonstrated synergistic effects with the FDA-approved anti-TB drugs rifampicin (ƩFIC 0.093), ethambutol (ƩFIC 0.061), and moxifloxacin (ƩFIC 0.154-0.281), exhibiting bactericidal time-kill properties in combination with these drugs.

    "text": "BACKGROUND: The transition from acute kidney injury (AKI) to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by persistent renal fibrosis, in which abnormal lipid metabolism plays a crucial role. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) has been implicated in various tissue remodeling processes; however, its role in lipid metabolism and fibrosis during the progression from AKI to CKD is not well understood.\n\nMETHODS: This study used a murine model of unilateral ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI-to-CKD progression for in vivo analysis and employed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced fibrosis in Human Kidney-2 cells and primary mouse tubular epithelial cells for in vitro studies. The tubule-specific knockout and overexpression of SDC-1 mice were utilized to investigate kidney fibrosis and lipid metabolism.\n\nRESULTS: Following unilateral ischemia-reperfusion and TGF-β stimulation, SDC-1 expression was significantly reduced, exacerbating renal fibrosis. Notably, SDC-1 deficiency led to lipid accumulation in the kidneys, while its overexpression alleviated lipid overload and improved metabolic parameters. Furthermore, SDC-1 played a crucial role in regulating fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), and its absence resulted in increased FABP7 levels. Inhibition of FABP7 not only reduced fibrosis but also restored carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α expression, which suggests that the SDC-1/FABP7 axis is critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis and mitigating fibrosis in the kidney.\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings underscore the importance of SDC-1 in lipid metabolism and suggest that targeting lipid metabolic pathways may represent therapeutic strategies that can slow the progression of AKI to CKD."

    "text": "Advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) treatment primarily involves targeted therapy and immunotherapy; however, many patients exhibit resistance to these modalities. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this resistance is essential for improved outcomes. Herein, we created a pazopanib-resistant 786-O-PR cell line, revealing an active mitophagy pathway and increased Parkin expression in the resistant cells. Knocking down Parkin enhanced the sensitivity of resistant cells to pazopanib, while its overexpression in parental cells induced resistance, which was partially reversed by the mitophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). In xenograft models, Parkin knockdown and pazopanib administration inhibited tumorigenesis. We further identified GLI Family Zinc Finger 2 (GLI2) as a potential Parkin regulator, with high expression correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Knocking down GLI2 increased pazopanib sensitivity and diminished mitophagy level in resistant cells; however, its overexpression enhanced resistance and mitophagy, with partial rescue achieved using 3-MA. Furthermore, GLI2 knockdown reduced Parkin mRNA and protein levels. In pazopanib-resistant 786-O-PR cells, GLI2 knockdown and Parkin overexpression partially restored pazopanib resistance, while GLI2 overexpression and Parkin knockdown in parental cells partially restored sensitivity. GLI2's binding sites on the Parkin promoter were identified using JASPAR database analysis and confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (CHIP-qPCR) and dual-luciferase assays, indicating GLI2's role in Parkin transcription. This study demonstrated that the GLI2-Parkin mitophagy pathway may be a therapeutic target for overcoming targeted therapy resistance in ccRCC."

Natural plant-based bioactive products are frequently preferred over synthetic chemicals for their safety and efficacy. This study aims to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of a botanical formulation, Immunogrit, in mitigating stress-associated senescence markers in the skin. d-Galactose (D-Gal) has been used to induce senescence-associated stress markers in HaCaT human keratinocytes. Additionally, a thorough chemical characterization employing ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (UPLC/MS-QToF) and high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) was performed to generate a comprehensive phytochemical profile of Immunogrit. In HaCaT cells, d-Gal-induction increased oxidative and nitrosative stress with a perturbed expression of cell cycle biomarkers. Enhanced SA-β-galactosidase activity and subsequent downregulation of nuclear protein, LMNB1, further established the suitability of d-Gal-induced HaCaT cells as the relevant skin model for investigating senescence-associated interventions at the molecular levels. Treatment of Immunogrit with d-Gal induction, prevented the upregulation of p16, p21, and p53 levels; and maintained the basal SA-β-galactosidase activity. This study also identified pAMPK and iNOS2 as the targets of d-Gal orchestrating oxidative and nitrosative stress. Immunogrit mitigated the d-Gal-modulated levels of pAMPK and iNOS2. Moreover, collagen degradation and upregulation of metalloprotease (MMP1 and MMP9) in d-Gal-induced HaCaT cells were ameliorated by Immunogrit treatment. Our findings highlight Immunogrit as a promising botanical therapy for alleviating the key cellular markers of senescence, in human keratinocytes."

Using the SARS-CoV-2 nAb as a proof-of-concept target, this system comprised a hybrid probe with the viral RBD as an antigen module covalently conjugated to a reporter DNA, and magnetic beads functionalized with the ACE2 mimic mini-protein as a receptor module, thereby recapitulating the natural antigen-receptor interactions. With this design, the neutralizing capability of nAb against the antigen was transformed into a competitive reduction of the probe binding and DNA amplification signal by qPCR. The NAD-qPCR demonstrated robust performance in quantifying commercial SARS-CoV-2 nAb with a LOD of 4 ng/μL. Furthermore, it was demonstrated to be capable of effectively profiling a large number of vaccinated donor serum with broad neutralization activity. Notably, the hybrid probe and the capture beads were designed modularly, which allows for straightforward adaptation to other pathogens by replacing the module component. This platform offers a rapid, high-throughput, and universally applicable approach for nAb detection in vaccine development and immune monitoring."

Although oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammation are associated with AAD, the precise interplay among these responses has remained unclear. In this study, aortas from mouse AD models were subjected to integrative ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis. The pathogenic targets governing oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammation were identified by single-cell RNA sequencing, ROS staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with PCR (ChIP-PCR), and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) analysis in the IFN-γ-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), mouse AAD model, and human ascending aortas. The transcriptional profiles of 191 differentially expressed genes revealed the IFN-γ response, oxidative stress-related NOD-like receptor, STING signaling pathways and marked elevation of STAT1, activated inflammation, DNA damage and ROS. Mechanistically, the activation of STAT1 binding on promoters of GBP3, H2aX and IFN-γ gene in nuclear as well as the interaction of GBP3 and STING protein in cytoplasm, determining a STAT1-GBP3-STING positive feedback loop triggering inflammation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress. Targeting this loop using STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine impedes aortic degeneration while improving survival (60 % vs. 90 %) and reducing aortic expansion (2.34 ± 0.18 mm vs. 1.55 ± 0.15 mm) in the mouse AAD model. This study provides novel insights into a transcriptional program permitting aortic degeneration, warranting consideration of a critical target STAT1 for an anti-inflammation, anti-DNA damage, and anti-oxidative stress intervention as an attractive strategy to manage temporal-specific AD by modulating the STAT1-GBP3-STING positive feedback loop."

Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that osteoporosis is consistently associated with vascular calcification, drawing attention to the interactions between bones and blood vessels, and giving rise to the concept of the bone-vascular axis. The bone vascular axis involves several factors, including osteokines such as FABP3, PDGF-BB, MYGDF, and Aging Bone-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (AB-EVs), which influence vascular calcification. Simultaneously, calcified blood vessels secrete sclerostin, Dickkopf1 (Dkk-1), Activin-A, and frizzled-related protein (SFRP), further affecting bone metabolism. The bone-vascular axis is characterized by reciprocal regulation and influence between the skeletal and vascular systems, and is crucial for maintaining bone metabolic homeostasis and preventing cardiovascular disease. However, the causal relationship between these two systems, as well as the specific regulatory mechanisms and targets, remains unclear. Therefore, this review aims to explore the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between bone and blood vessels from both the skeletal and vascular perspectives, as well as their common pathways, and to provide an overview of current therapeutic agents, with the goal of enhancing understanding of the bone-vascular association and offering new insights and approaches for clinical treatment."

The primary hypothesis of this study was that oxidative damage, caused in vivo by oxidative stress-a key factor in aging and various inflammatory diseases-deteriorates bone tissue quality by damaging bone collagen, the main component of the bone's organic phase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038). The hypothesis that physiological levels of oxidative damage generated in vitro degrade cortical bone mechanical properties by damaging the bone collagen has been confirmed. This suggests that oxidative damage of bone collagen is important towards understanding the degradation of bone quality in aging and various diseases."

This study investigates the interaction between proteins and structurally different nitrocellulose (CN) membranes and the resulting effects on signal intensity in an LFA under the influence of various buffer additives. The experiments focused on quantitative protein adsorption, protein stability, protein line printing and changes in signal intensity in a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-assay. A method was established for detecting the widths and intensities of fluorescent protein lines. We were able to show that changes in signal intensity of LFAs are driven by accessibility of the antibodies, by hydrophilicity of the membrane or assisted adsorption of antibodies onto the membrane. Additionally, the inclusion of sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate can enhance signal intensity. The method developed for protein line analysis has proven to be effective and can help to understand protein-membrane-interactions on a macroscopic level. We demonstrate that LFA-manufacturers have a range of options to fine-tune assay performance without major modifications to assay components."

The NHs were assigned following a 1:1 allocation ratio for control and intervention. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model, intervention components were participatorily developed over the first 6 mo and implemented over the remaining 6 mo. Muscle strength was measured via hand grip strength and a 30-second chair stand test. The Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit assessed the care-related QoL.

The protein 3C protease plays a crucial role as it blocks the virus replication. This study explores the potential of natural inhibitors, specifically Propolis compounds targeting the protein 3Cpro, which is a promising and less toxic alternative compared to the standard synthetic inhibitor, Rupintrivir.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A set of 60 propolis-derived molecules was selected and prepared for molecular docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinity to 3Cpro, then ligand-3Cpro protein interactions were visualized. A 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, then the following MD parameters were analyzed: RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonding. Binding free energies were further estimated using MM-PBSA, and per-residue energy decomposition was performed to identify key stabilizing interactions.\n\nRESULTS: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A displayed binding energies of -8.0 kcal/mol and -8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, outperforming the reference inhibitor Rupintrivir (-6.66 kcal/mol). MD simulations revealed that both ligands effectively stabilize 3Cpro, with RMSD scores of 1.02 ± 0.10 nm and 1,21 ± 0.22, respectively, and are also more stable in the pocket than Rupintrivir. These ligands also reduced RMSF, SASA, and Rg scores. MM-PBSA calculations showed more favorable binding energies for Rutin (-35.65 kcal/mol) and Retusapurpurin A (-31.59 kcal/mol) compared to Rupintrivir (-25.44 kcal/mol). Per-residue decomposition further revealed strong energetic contributions from catalytic site residues (His40, Glu71, and Cys147), especially in the Rutin complex.\n\nCONCLUSION: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A are promising inhibitors targeting 3Cpro, exhibiting elevated potential efficacy compared to Rupintrivir. These results pave the way for the development of natural antivirals derived from Propolis and support its use as a dietary supplement for the treatment of rhinovirus infections. The chemical diversity of Propolis could limit the emergence of viral resistance. However, in vitro and in vivo experimental validation is required to confirm these observations."

    "text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition with incompletely understood pathogenesis, affecting over 10 % of the global population. The poor understanding of these mechanisms impedes therapeutic development, leaving current treatments largely ineffective at halting or reversing disease progression. The balance between damage and repair in renal tubular epithelial cells, the primary renal parenchymal cells, is pivotal to CKD progression, and excessive damage to these cells significantly contributing to tubular atrophy and renal fibrosis. Recent studies leveraging single-cell sequencing reveal disease-associated dynamics and molecular drivers in renal tubular epithelial cells, with findings suggesting that alternative splicing (AS) represents a novel pathogenic mechanism in CKD. This review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of AS and its documented and emerging roles in CKD pathogenesis. Certain CKD driver molecules can globally regulate AS, while key CKD marker genes are prone to generating functionally distinct splice isoforms. In addition, the pathogenic mechanism of many familial kidney disease patients is gene mutation leading to abnormal splicing. This review aims to elucidate the functional link between AS and CKD, highlighting AS-targeting approaches as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, future research should further investigate the dynamics of AS and its regulators in CKD, and delineate their functional contributions."

Static DNA nanodevices have been engineered for the imaging and therapy, but they rely on the pre-assembly of DNA components and are limited by the low imaging contrast. Herein, we demonstrate the tumor microenvironment-responsive dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires for high-contrast imaging of multiple mRNAs and chemotherapy. We design a cruciform DNA module (C-model) as a basic structural unit of DNAzyme nanowire, which consists of two DNAzyme strands and two substrate strands with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) being inserted into the C-models by inlaying between guanine and cytosine. Once approaching tumor cells, C-models with two split i-motif spontaneously assemble into a DNAzyme nanowire through protonation-driven Hoogsteen interaction in response to extracellular acidic microenvironments. Upon the internalization, intracellular TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA hybridize with the overhangs of DNAzyme strands and substrate strands to form a stable DNAzyme/substrate/target three-way junction, inducing the cleavage of substrates by DNAzymes and the recovery of Cy5/Texas Red fluorescence. AS1411 aptamer-functionalized DOX-nanowires can selectively endocytose into cancer cells via AS1411-mediated recognition of nucleolin overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. Notably, the dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires is characterized by efficient intracellular delivery and intrinsic resistance to nucleases, facilitating the high-contrast imaging of mRNAs. This method can accurately measure TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA in living cells and discriminate multiple mRNAs in breast cancer tissues and their normal counterparts, providing a powerful platform for clinical diagnosis."

The process was successfully scaled from flask to bioreactor, maintaining the aroma profile without off-flavors. Aeration and vitamin B1 and C supplementation significantly increased key aroma compounds: (E,Z)-2,4-decadienal and (E,E)-2,4-decadienal reached odor activity values of up to 142 and 261, respectively, compared to 63 and 28 in the standard bioreactor fermentation. Dimethyl disulfide and methyl propyl disulfide, associated with \"onion-like\" notes, were reduced below 1 (vs. 38). Benzothiazole, potentially contributing to \"meat-like\" aroma, increased to 1. Cytotoxicity assays confirmed 100% cell viability, indicating safety. Flavored water and oil phases obtained from flask fermentation, extracted in situ, were applied to pea protein-based burger patties, and significantly enhanced \"meat-like\" and \"tallow-like\" odor attributes. These findings support the use of fungal fermentation to improve the flavor of plant-based meat alternatives."

Plasma FA profile was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Body composition and hepatic steatosis were analysed using computerised tomography. Tumour tissue underwent transcriptomic analysis for consensus molecular subtype (CMS) stratification. Patients with CC (median age 73 years, 46.5% women) had significantly decreased total plasma FA content versus controls (median age 58 years, 41.2% women) (1510.0 nmol/mL vs. 4194.6 nmol/mL median values respectively, p < 0.001). This reduction (≥50%) was consistent across all species, independently of sex, age, body composition or cancer stage. An elevated unsaturated-to-saturated FA ratio was observed in CMS2 tumours (p = 0.01). Plasma inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) were above normal range in patients in a stage-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Hepatic enzymes fell within normal range, yet increased with tumour stage. This study indicates that plasma FA content reduction is an intrinsic metabolic alteration of CC already occurring in early stages. Further research will aid clinical significance."

Participants completed self-reported questionnaires on demographic characteristics, physical health, activity levels, dietary index scores, dietary habits, and depressive symptoms.\n\nRESULTS: Participants were female (OR: 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.30-1.46), divorced or widowed (OR: 1.56, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.85), had a higher waist-hip ratio, and (OR: 2.22; 95 % CI: 1.43-3.43) and engaged in prolonged sedentary time (OR: 1.51; 95 % CI: 1.41-1.62) were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Regarding dietary factors, an anti-inflammatory dietary (OR: 0.79; 95 % CI: 0.75-0.83) and a protein-enriched dietary (OR: 0.87; 95 % CI: 0.83-0.92) were associated with a lower risk of depressive symptoms.

These findings suggest potential links between dietary and lifestyle factors and depressive symptoms, which may warrant further investigation in prospective or interventional studies."

Ritonavir, XK263, and AHA001 are inhibitors that can bind to Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) protease to disrupt its enzymatic activity. However, various dynamic intracellular environments can develop a harmonic force, ultimately dissociating these ligands from the HIV-1 binding pocket, which are essential to study. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enable a platform to efficiently visualize and quantify the bound-unbound states of these ligand molecules in the presence of applied harmonic forces. We investigate the unbinding of Ritonavir, XK263, and AHA001 molecules from the HIV-1 protease dimer using an all-atom Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulation that induces an external stimulus as a constant harmonic force. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from the trajectories generated by SMD simulations show insights into the free energy landscape associated with the ligand's dissociation from HIV-1 protease, including the energetic barriers and favorable interactions involved in the process. Our results show that Ritonavir, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA approved antiretroviral drug for HIV-1, has enhanced binding strength, followed by AHA001, which also shows a strong binding affinity comparable to many other FDA-approved drugs, as evidenced by the binding free energy calculations derived from Umbrella Sampling (US) simulations. The transient variations of corresponding protein-ligand interaction energies and calculations for hydrogen bond formation agree with the earlier findings. The predictions contribute to understanding how these three ligands can act as effective inhibitors for the HIV-1 viral protein."

    "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). α-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a key protein implicated in PD pathogenesis, with its structural and biophysical properties widely investigated due to their role in disease mechanisms. The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach. Studies suggest that berberine (BBR) may mitigate PD-related neuropathology. However, the exact mechanisms by which BBR exerts its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. This review explores the potential molecular pathways through which BBR could alleviate PD pathology."

Utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) in conjunction with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we identified proteins that exhibit significant associations with delirium. Additionally, we investigated the bidirectional relationship between delirium and aging-related indicators, such as the frailty index (FI), Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), PhenoAge, and life expectancy. This was achieved through mediation analysis and Bayesian colocalization to assess the intermediary effects of these indicators. Finally, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the identified proteins via molecular docking studies.\n\nRESULTS: MR analysis revealed causal relationships between delirium and several aging-related indicators, including FI, IEAA, PhenoAge, and life expectancy. Eleven proteins were causally associated with delirium. Mediation analysis showed that the effects of HIBCH and IMPAD1 on delirium were mediated by PhenoAge, while IEAA mediated the effect of MICB. MST1's effect on delirium was mediated by FI and life expectancy. Bayesian colocalization confirmed strong associations between HIBCH, MST1, and delirium. Molecular docking studies indicated that MST1 and HIBCH exhibited low binding energies with midazolam and dexmedetomidine, suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets.\n\nCONCLUSION: HIBCH and MST1 are key players in delirium pathophysiology and represent promising therapeutic candidates.

Next, MD simulations of six protein- golden ligand complexes (PDB IDs: 4QXQ, 5GS4, 5JL6, 5LX6, 6ME6, and 7PCD), performed with GROMACS over 100 ns at 298.15 K, provided valuable information about their structural dynamics. Analysis of the radius of gyration (Rg) revealed that, while five complexes (7PCD, 5GS4, 5LX6, 4QXQ, and 5JL6) maintained compact structures (Rg between 1.7 and 2.3 nm), the 6ME6 complex exhibited a more extended and flexible conformation (average Rg ∼3.4 nm). Complementary RMSD analysis confirmed that most complexes rapidly stabilized with minimal deviations (generally <0.3 nm), whereas the 6ME6 complex showed higher variability, reaching up to 0.67 nm. Furthermore, Binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA and PBSA methods further supported these findings, with energies ranging from -21.45 ± 2.28 kcal/mol (5LX6) to -39.79 ± 1.34 kcal/mol (6ME6), indicating an optimal balance between intrinsic interactions and desolvation costs in the 6ME6 and 5JL6 systems.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) from astrocytes drive this process, yet the release mechanism, potentially involving extracellular vesicles (EVs), remains unclear. Rab27a releases EVs from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by enabling their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. We confirmed Rab27a expression, and its localization, subsequently, EV release was validated with CD9, Alix, and TSG101 markers. Rab27a-mediated EV release was confirmed in both Rab27a-induced and Rab27a-siRNA-treated cells. Rab27a-derived EVs inhibited neuronal cell growth, while Rab27a-siRNA EVs promoted neuronal growth. Our study also observed upregulated Rab27a expression in the rat contusion model of SCI. Further analysis showed increased CSPG expression in Rab27a-induced conditions via the Rho/ROCK pathway, with altered pAkt, and β-tubulin III, levels. Immunohistochemistry confirmed CSPG/Rab27a/GFAP and CSPG/CD9 co-localization in tissue sections, verifying that Rab27a mediates EV release containing CSPG from astrocytes. These findings suggest that Rab27a plays a crucial role in CSPG release via EVs and scar formation. Functional recovery was significantly improved with Rab27a-siRNA treatment, suggesting Rab27a as a potential target for astrocytic scar modulation in SCI. The study reveals the detailed mechanistic insight of Rab27a-dependent CSPG release via EVs for sub-acute scar formation in contusion SCI."

Nevertheless, the inherent drawbacks of PROTAC technology hinder its clinical translation. The integration of nanotechnology with PROTAC molecules to create nano-PROTACs for combined therapy offers a promising solution. Among the various cancer treatment methods, phototherapy is considered the optimal choice to integrate with specific PROTACs due to its proven effectiveness and non-invasive nature. Herein, a nano-PROTAC formulation (ARV@PEG-ICG) consisting of a phototherapeutic agent named indocyanine green functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-ICG) and a BRD4 degrader (ARV-825) was fabricated for cancer photo-immunotherapy. Activated by acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), ARV@PEG-ICG nanoparticles (NPs) will decompose rapidly for ARV delivery. PEG-ICG generated abundant ROS with laser irradiation, downregulating the expression of Bcl-xL and inducing the cleavage of PARP to stimulate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the degradation of BRD4, a transcriptional cofactor, inhibited nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generation to improve phototherapeutic efficacy. In a 4T1 breast tumor model, dying 4T1 cells released tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to serve as the immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, facilitating DC maturation and T cell activation and amplifying systemic immune response. The distant tumor growth can also be inhibited due to the activation of long-term immune response. Overall, the current study aims to combine typical PROTAC with functional nanomaterials to form nano-PROTAC with high performance for PROTAC delivery mediated cancer treatment."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have emerged as a leading platform for gene therapy, supported by several FDA-approved products and numerous clinical trials. Due to their biological complexity and heterogeneity, rigorous analytical methods are essential to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of rAAV-based products. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as aggregation, full/empty capsid ratios, viral protein composition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) must be monitored comprehensively. While several chromatographic techniques address individual CQAs, there is a growing industrial need for techniques that enable multi-attribute analysis in a single run.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography-ultraviolet detection-reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-UV-RPLC-MS) method for the comprehensive characterization of rAAV vectors. The method enables simultaneous assessment of high molecular weight species (aggregates), capsid identity, and PTMs. In the first dimension, SEC separates intact viral particles and quantifies aggregates, followed by a targeted heart-cut of the monomeric fraction. This fraction is then subjected to RPLC for protein separation under denaturing conditions, with high-resolution MS used to identify viral proteins and their modifications. Initially optimized for rAAV8, the method was successfully extended to other rAAV serotypes, demonstrating its adaptability across serotypes. A forced degradation study under thermal stress conditions further highlighted the method's ability to monitor structural integrity and stability of the viral vectors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This study presents a novel 2D-LC-MS approach for streamlined, multi-attribute analysis of viral vector products. By combining multiple analyses into a single run, this 2D-LC-MS method can be considered as a powerful tool for comprehensive analysis of gene therapy vectors in the future. Potential applications include real-time in-process control, comparability studies, stability testing, support during process development for aggregate or PTM profiling, and drug substance or product characterization."

Inspired by the heterogeneous interfacial structure of natural skin, this study developed a chitosan(CS)-based Janus wound dressing with asymmetric wettability. The inner layer consists of methacrylated chitosan (CSMA), incorporating polydopamine-coated silica (PDA-SiO₂) nanoparticles to form a hydrophilic sponge with hemostatic, antioxidant, and pro-angiogenic properties. The outer layer is a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofiber membrane integrated with antibacterial agent zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), creating a hydrophobic barrier to prevent bacterial invasion. In vitro tests confirmed effective bacterial resistance, while hemostasis assays demonstrated enhanced platelet and red blood cell aggregation, accelerating coagulation. In vivo evaluations using rat liver injury and tail amputation models confirmed superior hemostatic performance, with blood loss reduced by 0.44 g and 0.23 g, respectively, and bleeding time shortened by 41.52 s and 59.47 s compared to Gauze. Furthermore, in full-thickness skin wound models, accelerated healing was achieved through infection prevention, increased collagen deposition (20.82 % higher than Control), and stimulated angiogenesis (3.10 % higher CD31 expression). These findings highlight CM@PS/TZ as a promising Janus dressing integrating antibacterial activity, hemostasis, and pro-angiogenic effects, offering an innovative solution for hemorrhagic wound treatment."

We designed and synthesized a series of O-glucoside derivatives by introducing nitrogen-containing heterocyclic fragments. Among them, compound E9 showed the most protective effect on the glucose-free DMEM-induced injured cardiomyocytes, and the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of these compounds were preliminarily evaluated in cardiomyocyte injury model. Furthermore, compound E9 significantly enhanced the inhibition of SGLT2, NHE1, and SOD enzyme activity, increased ATP levels in damaged cardiomyocytes, and suppressed Ang II-induced myocardial fibrosis, the autophagy receptor protein P62 and the expression of cell injury markers. Additionally, compound E9 significantly improved cardiac function in TAC-induced HF mice, inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition, ameliorated myocardial tissue damage, enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in injured cardiomyocytes, and ultimately increased survival rates in HF mice. In conclusion, this study reveals that the novel O-glucoside derivative E9 was a promising compound for the treatment of heart failure."

Traditional animal-based proteins pose environmental concerns, contributing to high carbon emissions, and overconsumption can lead to health issues. Alternative proteins, including plant-based, cultured meats, insects, algae, and microbial proteins, offer promising solutions; however, knowledge of their digestibility is limited, and the reported documents are often quite low. For instance, plant proteins contain anti-nutritional factors like phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors, which hinder absorption. Similarly, insects, algae, and microbial proteins have complex cellular structures or compounds that can interfere with protein breakdown and absorption. On the other hand, cultured meats may lack certain components critical for optimal digestion. Thus, novel and conventional processing methods are being studied to improve digestibility. In this context, continued research is essential to refine these techniques for different protein sources, ensuring a sustainable production of alternative proteins with high nutritional quality."

Quercetin and caffeic promoted nearly iron release at all polyphenol-to-complex levels studied (0.5:1 to 3:1), whereas gallic acid only promoted iron release at higher ratios (3:1). Polyphenol retention after digestion was relatively low (1 %-7 %), except for caffeic acid (21.5 % at 3:1). A Caco-2 cell assay showed that ferritin production was enhanced at high gallic acid levels (3:1), and intermediate quercetin levels (1:1), but not under other conditions.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression, Pearson correlation, and mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate odds ratios and associations between inflammatory indicators and depression.\n\nRESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed significant negative associations between four inflammatory indicators (CRP, C-reactive protein; PC, platelet count; SII, systemic immune-inflammation index; PPN, product of platelet count and neutrophil count) and HDL cholesterol, as well as between HDL cholesterol and depression, while the inflammatory indicators were significantly positively correlated with depression (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for covariates, demonstrated that elevated levels of these four inflammatory indicators (CRP: adjusted OR = 1.011, CI = 1.003-1.025; PC: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004; SII: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.003; PPN: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004) were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression in the total study population. Finally, mediation analysis indicated that HDL cholesterol mediated the presumed causal associations between CRP (6.7-13.2 %), PC (4.5-12.8 %), PPN (4.8-14.9 %), and depression, whereas SII was identified as an independent predictor of depression development.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting HDL cholesterol and inflammatory indicators such as CRP, PC, SII and PPN may provide potential interventions for mitigating depression risk."

The development of an analysis method for the sensitive monitoring of antifungal drugs is crucial, given their narrow therapeutic index. Traditional plasma sample processing involves several complex steps. Some of the processes are time-consuming, may result in the loss of trace components, and increase the difficulty of detection. To address these limitations, this work focused on developing a multi-component covalent organic framework (COF) coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber for efficient extraction and determination of triazole antifungal drugs in human plasma.\n\nRESULTS: The multi-component COF TAPT-DMTP-TFTA was synthesized using 4,4',4''-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthaldehyde (TFTA), and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP), which exhibited high surface areas, considerable regular porosity and multiple recognition sites, rendering it an ideal adsorbent for the efficient enrichment of antifungal drugs.

    "text": "Microplastics (MPs), particularly polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs), have emerged as significant environmental pollutants with potential risks to human health. Their presence has been detected in human tissues, including blood and placental tissue, raising concerns about developmental effects. However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation. These results underscore the detrimental impact of PS-MPs on embryonic kidney development and highlight the urgent need for further investigation into the health risks associated with microplastic exposure during early human development."

    "text": "Glycosylation of membrane proteins plays an essential role in diverse biological processes. However, it remains unknown whether this posttranslational modification occurs on ciliary membrane proteins. Herein, by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that multiple membrane proteins localized in the ciliary transition zone undergo core fucosylation, an N-linked glycosylation specifically catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8). In-depth analysis reveals that FUT8 interacts with transmembrane protein 67 (TMEM67), a transition zone component closely linked to ciliopathies, and catalyzes its core fucosylation. Functional investigation shows that core fucosylation stabilizes TMEM67 by impeding its degradation via the autophagy pathway, thereby ensuring its proper localization to the transition zone to promote cilium formation. Fut8-deficient mice exhibit ciliary defects in multiple organs, such as the kidney, brain, and trachea. These findings uncover a critical role for TMEM67 core fucosylation in ciliogenesis and have important implications for the pathogenesis of ciliopathies."

Gremlin 1 (GREM1), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist family, has emerged as a central regulator of cellular and extracellular dynamics, exhibiting dual roles in oncogenesis and fibrosis. By modulating BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways, GREM1 orchestrates critical pathogenic processes, including immune evasion, stromal dynamics, fibroblast activation, and angiogenesis. This review compiles current mechanistic insights into GREM1's dual roles in cancer and fibrosis, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. GREM1 contributes to tumor progression by promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and therapy resistance while driving extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling in fibrotic disorders. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including demethyleneberberine (DMB), anti-GREM1 antibodies, and circular RNAs, demonstrate potential in mitigating GREM1-driven pathological processes. GREM1's pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cancer and fibrosis highlights its promise as a target for innovative combination therapies and biomarker-based precision medicine approaches. However, translating these insights into clinical practice requires addressing challenges related to delivery specificity, off-target effects, and patient heterogeneity."

It exerts this effect by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), attenuating insulin activity. It is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily member, which includes a wide range of enzymes encoded by 107 distinct genes. The catalytic site of the PTP superfamily is positively charged and highly conserved among its members, which presents a significant challenge to developing inhibitors in terms of selectivity and oral bioavailability. T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which plays a crucial role in the proliferation of T-cells and B-cells, is a close homologue of PTP1B, sharing 74 % sequence similarity within the catalytic domain. Although considerable efforts have been made to develop a selective and potent PTP1B inhibitor, no molecule has yet been developed as a drug. However, a few candidate compounds reached phase II clinical trials, but their further study was discontinued due to suboptimal efficacy and the manifestation of undesirable side effects. In this review, we aimed to decipher the complications associated with the PTP1B enzyme and the design strategies used by various research groups to develop small-molecule inhibitors, emphasising the structure-activity relationship of small molecules synthesized for this target. This review also delineates the molecular features, which will aid in designing rational approaches and foster further research into this target of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

The paper discusses molecular representations, performance evaluation metrics, and current trends in Generative AI-driven drug discovery, such as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), drug-target interactions (DTIs) and de-novo drug design. However, these approaches face significant challenges, including applicability domain issues, lack of interpretability, data scarcity, novelty, scalability, computational resource limitations, and the absence of standardized evaluation metrics. These challenges hinder model performance, complicate decision-making, and limit the generation of novel and viable drug candidates. To address these issues, strategies such as hybrid models, integration of multiomics datasets, explainable AI (XAI) techniques, data augmentation, transfer learning, and cloud-based solutions are proposed. Additionally, a curated list of databases supporting drug discovery research is provided.

Considering their multifactorial nature, research has focused on the study of small molecules able to simultaneously tackle different targets involved in their onset and progression. In this paper, two sets of acylaminopyrazole-based compounds were designed to exploit the aminopyrazole core as a privileged structure properly decorated with an acyl moiety and a further amide function, connected with a proper spacer. Indeed, acylated aminopyrazoles could be able to establish the appropriate hydrogen bond pattern to both bind GSK-3β, responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation, prevent the formation of insoluble Aβ-protein aggregates and have the structural features to show chelating properties towards metals involved in neuroinflammation. The collection of compounds was tested in vitro for GSK-3β inhibition activity, antiaggregating and chelating properties. Selected compounds were able to inhibit GSK-3β in the low micromolar range with a reversible and competitive mechanism of action, as established by Microfluidic Mobility Shift Assay (MMSA) and showed metal chelating ability. Preliminary Structure Activity Relationships (SARs) to hit these distinct and interconnected targets for neuromodulation were established. Finally, selected compounds showed good apparent permeability values in parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) together with good cellular safety profile. The collected results validated acylaminopyrazole as promising scaffold for the development of multitarget-directed ligands. Compounds 1c and 4c emerged as promising prototypes, and deserve further optimization in the search for drug candidates for polypharmacological approach in neurodegenerative disease."

The intestinal transport of peptides in these digests was studied using a model of Caco-2 simulated intestinal epithelial layer. Results suggest that treatment with digests of oxidized MPs not only induces ROS and inflammatory stress of Caco-2 cells (evidenced by increased ROS levels, increased mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β, and decreased enzyme activity of SOD, CAT, and GPx), but also negatively affects cell viability.

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes. For both polyphenols, binding significantly decreased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic regions, reorganized secondary structure (α-helix loss and β-sheet gain), and markedly enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity. These findings demonstrate that selecting an appropriate polyphenol type and dose can simultaneously confer hypoallergenic potential, controlled digestibility, and elevated antioxidant function. These findings highlight the potential of non-covalent protein-polyphenol assemblies to develop plant-based foods and nutraceuticals with improved health benefits."

The results showed that both encapsulation and ultrasonic treatment significantly enhanced the Qu embedding rate (ER), yield, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the nanoliposome by 43.15 ± 1.29 %, 8.57 ± 0.74 %, and 24.38 ± 1.53 %, respectively, with an 87.50 ± 3.28 % decrease in diameter compared to unsonicated MP-Qu-Lipo.

However, the bioavailability of its conjugated linolenic acids, an essential factor for assessing their impact on health, remains poorly understood. This study used the harmonized in vitro protocol INFOGEST to investigate the bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil in comparison to olive oil. Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, punicic acid is efficiently released by digestive lipases, suggesting good bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil. This finding paves the way for its potential application in oral therapeutic use."

Tenovin-1 (Ten-1), a sirtuin-1/2 inhibitor, decreased the SIRT2 activity in human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, which was rescued by EGCG and GT. Ten-1 decreased the protein level of CLDN4, which was rescued by EGCG, whereas CLDN1 expression was changed by neither Ten-1 nor EGCG. Ten-1 decreased the tight junctional localization of CLDN4, transepithelial electrical resistance, and paracellular permeability to FD4, a fluorescence paracellular flux marker, which were rescued by EGCG. Ten-1 increased the acetylation level of CLDN4, which was inhibited by EGCG without affecting NAD"

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Age is a well-established predictor of poor prognosis in patients with ischemic stroke (IS) undergoing endovascular treatment (EVT). The endothelium plays a central role in the pathophysiology of IS, and its function can be evaluated using various methods. This study aims to investigate the relationship between endothelial dysfunction, age, and clinical outcomes in IS patients treated with EVT METHODS: Patients with IS treated with EVT were included in the study. Ninety-day prognosis was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Endothelial function was assessed through flow-mediated dilation (FMD) measured by brachial artery ultrasound, and by quantifying pre-EVT arterial serum levels of arginine metabolites, homoarginine (hArg), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Clinical, radiological, and EVT procedural data were recorded as independent variables. The outcome variable is good functional outcome by dichotomized mRS<2. Bivariate, multivariate, and mediation analyses were conducted to explore associations.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 150 stroke patients were included in the analysis (median age was 77 years and 50.7 % were female). Older patients exhibited poorer endothelial function, reflected by lower FMD values and altered arginine metabolite profiles. They also showed worse clinical outcomes at 90 days. Among the metabolites, SDMA emerged as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (OR = 1.343 per 0.1 umol/l increase, p < 0.01). Moreover, SDMA was identified as a mediator in the relationship between age and unfavorable outcomes following EVT CONCLUSION: Endothelial dysfunction, as indicated by circulating biomarkers such as SDMA, may partially mediate the association between age and poorer outcomes in stroke patients treated with EVT."

For this, the study included 34 patients diagnosed with PPGLs. Pre-operative and postoperative serum samples were analyzed using 1D-proton NMR spectroscopy, and NMR spectral data were processed using Bruker software Topspin. The quantitative metabolic profiles were estimated using CHENOMX NMR-Suite, and multivariate data were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal PLS-DA followed by random forest (RF) classification method (a machine learning approach). The multivariate analysis revealed distinct metabolic differences between pre-operative and postoperative samples with respect to normal control (NC) samples, indicating a metabolic shift following tumor resection. RF classification, with an out-of-bag error rate of 0.186, effectively distinguished between NC, presurgery, and postsurgery groups, underscoring the distinct metabolic states in PPGL and the restorative effect of surgical intervention. Pre-operative serum profiles of PPGL patients were characterized by decreased levels of key metabolites, including glucose, citrate, amino acids (glutamine, glycine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, and alanine), histidine, myo-inositol, and creatinine, suggesting altered energy metabolism, and amino acid catabolism induced by catecholamine excess. Postsurgical profiles showed partial metabolic restoration, with significant increases in proline, glutamate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) (p < 0.01), indicating normalization involving lipid oxidation and amino acid metabolism. Although plasma metanephrines normalized postsurgery, full biochemical recovery lagged, as metabolic profiles of postoperative patients remained distinct from healthy controls. In conclusion, the present untargeted NMR metabolomics revealed significant metabolic reprogramming in PPGL patients and captured the partial normalization of metabolic pathways following tumor resection. Metabolites such as proline, glutamate, and 3-HB emerged as potential biomarkers of treatment response. These findings underscore the utility of metabolomics to identify biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, assessing postsurgical recovery, and improving our understanding of PPGL pathophysiology."

PhenoAge was calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers (albumin, creatinine, glucose, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte%, mean cell volume, red blood cell distribution width, alkaline phosphatase, and white blood cell count). PhenoAgeAccel was derived as residuals from linear regression of PhenoAge on chronological age. Participants were stratified by PhenoAge [<46.6792 (792-64.774 (T1-T2), ≥64.774 (≥T2)] and PhenoAgeAccel [<-4.3382 (382-0.9896 (T1-T2), ≥0.9896 (≥T2)] tertiles.

    "text": "Proper brain function relies on an adequate supply of energy - mainly glucose - to power neuronal activity. Delivery of this nutrient to the neuropil is mediated by the Glucose Transporter1 (GLUT1) protein. Perturbing glucose supply to the brain is profoundly damaging and exemplified by the neurodevelopmental disorder, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS). Resulting from haploinsufficiency of the SLC2A1 (GLUT1) gene, GLUT1DS is characterized by intractable infantile-onset seizures and a disabling movement disorder. Ketogenic diets, which supply the brain with an alternate energy source, ketone bodies, are currently the preferred therapeutic option for Glut1DS patients but do not address the underlying cause - low brain glucose - of the disease. One intuitively appealing therapeutic strategy that does, involves restoring GLUT1 levels to the patient brain. Here, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of the human GLUT1 genomic locus in a mouse model of GLUT1DS raises brain GLUT1 levels and reduces disease burden. Augmenting GLUT1 levels in mutants correspondingly raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels, improved motor performance and reduced the frequency of seizures characteristically observed in GLUT1DS. Interestingly, the increased GLUT1 in mutants harboring the human GLUT1 locus was at least partly the result of an increase in murine Slc2a1 (Glut1) activity, most likely the effect of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) embedded in the human transgene. Collectively, our work has not only shown that repleting human GLUT1 mitigates GLUT1DS but also has yielded transgenic mice that constitute a useful tool to test and optimize clinically promising agents designed to stimulate this gene for therapeutic purposes."

    "text": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, leading to reduced SMN protein expression. Increasing evidence implicates neurotransmission deficits in the pathophysiology of SMA. In particular, alterations in neuroactive amino acids involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission have recently been identified in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMApatients and the spinal cord of SMNΔ7 mouse models. L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, plays a critical role in glutamatergic receptor signalling, influencing neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. However, it remains unclear whether SMN deficiency affects L-arginine metabolism in SMA. To address this, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to investigate whether SMN deficiency alters L-arginine homeostasis in the central nervous system of SMNΔ7 mice and in the CSF of SMA patients with varying disease severity, both before and after treatment with the SMN-inducing therapy Nusinersen. Notably, we observed significantly reduced L-arginine levels in the brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic SMA mice compared to age-matched wild-type littermates. Consistent with these findings, we revealed lower L-arginine levels in severe SMA1 patients compared to milder SMA2 and SMA3 patients and healthy controls, enhancing the translational strength of our findings. Importantly, Nusinersen-mediated SMN upregulation fully restored L-arginine homeostasis in the CSF of severe SMA1 patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a dysregulation of L-arginine in SMA and highlight a role for SMN-enhancing therapies in restoring neurochemical alterations observed in patients with this neurodegenerative disease."

RNA-Seq analysis of colon tissues and UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS phytochemical profiling were integrated with functional validation using erastin-induced ferroptosis in Caco-2 cells. Virtual docking, molecular interactions, and gene-editing were employed for mechanistic investigation.\n\nRESULTS: PHE administration significantly attenuated DSS-induced weight loss and disease activity index elevation, while preserving intestinal mucosal integrity. Transcriptomic analysis and in vivo experiments revealed PHE's regulation of glutathione metabolic pathways and ferroptosis. The flavonoids in PHE, especially aromadendrin, were identified as the primary active component binding to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(KEAP1)'s Kelch domain, thereby activating Nrf2 signaling and upregulating glutathione (GSH) synthesis genes. Nrf2 ablation or KEAP1 over-expression abolished PHE's protective effects, confirming pathway specificity.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings establish that PHE exerts anti-colitis effects through KEAP1/Nrf2/GSH axis-mediated ferroptosis inhibition, with aromadendrin serving as the key bioactive compound. This mechanistic elucidation provides translational rationale for developing PHE-based therapies for ulcerative colitis."

Each segment of the SpA operon, from the 5' promoter region and signal peptide to the 3' cell wall anchoring region, has been exploited for various innovative applications in areas such as immunology and biotechnology. We provide an overview of selected applications and concepts that have had a significant impact on life science research, and some that have also led to significant commercial implications. In the 1980s, the SpA promoter and signal sequence were utilized in Escherichia coli for recombinant production of various proteins, yielding product secretion to the culture medium and thereby simplifying product recovery. The five homologous Ig-binding domains of SpA gained tremendous interest in the late 1980s, largely due to the rise of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use, prompting a growing demand for effective affinity ligands to facilitate their purification. Over the years, these Ig-binding domains have been extensively investigated and re-engineered to bind proteins other than antibodies, leading in the mid-1990s to the development of the affibody affinity protein technology. Today, affibody molecules are being investigated in late-stage clinical trials as potential protein therapeutics for various indications. Finally, the cell wall anchoring regions of SpA inspired the development of a surface display system for Staphylococcus carnosus, which has emerged as a technology platform in combinatorial protein engineering for work with large peptide, antibody and affibody libraries."

However, targeted metabolomics studies of serum amino acids in silicosis patients remain limited. Herein, we developed a specific serum amino acid metabolomics assay for identifying differential amino acids as biomarkers, providing a sensitive and reliable basis for diagnosing silicosis. A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 21 amino acids in serum was established by optimizing chromatographic and sample preparation conditions. The method validation results showed good linearity (r > 0.99), recovery (78.3 %-128.4 %) and precision (1.27 %-13.01 %). The developed method was utilized to detect the levels of 21 amino acids in the serum of the silicosis patient group (SP; n = 104) and the healthy control group (HC; n = 118). The concentration of four amino acids (glutamate, arginine, aspartic acid and ornithine) was significantly different between the SP and the HC. Single diagnostic biomarkers exhibited area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.712 to 0.892, while the glutamate-arginine combination achieved superior performance (AUC = 0.915, 86.1 % sensitivity, 90.0 % specificity). The aforementioned results indicate that four biomarkers were screened for the diagnosis of silicosis, with glutamate emerging as the most accurate single biomarker for predicting silicosis. The diagnostic performance was further enhanced by combining glutamate with arginine, which improved both sensitivity and specificity."

Although neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes have been implicated, the roles of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in treatment-naïve RLS remain unclear.\n\nMETHODS: In this case-control study, 108 treatment-naïve RLS patients and 90 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Serum levels of GFAP, BDNF, and NfL were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Symptom severity and quality of life were assessed using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) and the RLS Quality of Life Questionnaire (QoL-RLS), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate biomarker associations with disease risk. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to assess the discriminative ability of serum GFAP, BDNF, and NfL levels in differentiating RLS patients from controls. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate diagnostic performance.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to controls, RLS patients had significantly higher serum levels of GFAP (148.27 ± 32.53 vs. 96.44 ± 27.81 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and NfL (15.35 ± 4.82 vs. 9.78 ± 3.59 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and lower levels of BDNF (18.71 ± 5.69 vs. 23.95 ± 6.12 pg/mL, p = 0.002). Multivariate analyses confirmed these markers as independent predictors of RLS (GFAP: OR = 1.592, BDNF: OR = 0.372, NfL: OR = 1.953, all p < 0.01). NfL was positively correlated with both IRLS (β = 0.531, p = 0.012) and QoL-RLS scores (β = 0.356, p = 0.007), while GFAP was associated with QoL impairment (β = 0.724, p < 0.001), and BDNF showed a negative association with symptom severity (β = -0.287, p = 0.003). ROC analyses showed strong discriminative power for GFAP (AUC = 0.919), NfL (AUC = 0.856), and BDNF (AUC = 0.797).\n\nCONCLUSION: Serum GFAP, BDNF, and NfL are independently associated with RLS presence and severity, highlighting their potential as peripheral biomarkers of neuroglial and axonal dysfunction. These findings provide mechanistic insight and support their utility in the diagnosis and monitoring of RLS and may serve as peripheral indicators of neurobiological involvement and could have potential utility in future research related to disease monitoring or treatment response."

    "text": "In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern the pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy of drugs, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the \"black box\" nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding."

In intestine, tryptophan is metabolized primarily by the kynurenine pathway, which is regulated by the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). Tryptophan flow into the kynurenine pathway limits its availability for the formation of microbiota-derived indole derivatives including butyrate, and limits availability of tryptophan for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) pathway. Feeding Ldlr-/- mice a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD+HCD) increased intestinal IDO1 activity, decreased levels of tryptophan, fecal butyrate, and 5-HT. Ldlr-/- mice deficient in intestinal Ido1  ( Ldlr-/-Ido1-/- ) on HFD+HCD had increased intestinal levels of 5-HT, increased gut permeability, increased gut inflammation, increased LPS, and increased aortic atherosclerosis. Ldlr-/- mice fed HFD+HCD and treated with a 5-HT pathway inhibitor had increased fecal indole levels, improved gut-barrier, increased antimicrobial peptide levels, and decreased aortic atherosclerosis without a change in plasma cholesterol.\n\nSUMMARY: These studies demonstrate the importance of microbiota-derived products and intestinal tryptophan metabolism in atherosclerosis."

Our prior in vivo studies demonstrated that the absence of lipocalin prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) leads to the development of fatty liver disease, and L-PGDS expression significantly decreased when C57BL/6 mice were kept on a high-fat diet. Briefly, L-PGDS belongs to the arachidonic acid pathway and enzymatically isomerizes prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2, which imparts pharmacological effects via two receptors called DP1 and DP2. L-PGDS is an essential key player in fatty liver disease, but its mechanistic regulation still remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to study the mechanistic regulation of L-PGDS using a palmitate-induced cellular MASLD model. We successfully recapitulated the MASLD phenotype in HepG2 cells with palmitate treatment. Our results showed significant lipid accumulation and increased lipidassociated protein and gene expression, along with palmitate concentration-dependent L-PGDS downregulation. To study the L-PGDS downregulation, we employed MG132, chloroquine, and cycloheximide to assess proteasomal degradation, autophagy, and translational activity, respectively. Our gene and protein expression data suggested the possible reason for L-PGDS downregulation via inhibiting transcription and subsequently translation. Additionally, our autophagy results also showed a role in LPGDS downregulation. In summary, it can be concluded that palmitate treatment downregulated L-PGDS, possibly involving transcription-translation and/or autophagy pathways. However, further studies are needed to delineate the precise molecular mechanism and apply this knowledge to MASLD pathogenesis and treatment."

    "text": "As the demand for functional foods and precision nutrition continues to rise, there is an urgent need for advanced delivery systems that improve the stability, bioavailability, and targeted release of sensitive bioactive compounds. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), commonly found in fermented foods, have taken on a dual role-as both passive encapsulation targets and active delivery carriers-forming a conceptual basis for the development of next-generation food delivery systems. This review examines the interactions between LAB and various food-grade encapsulation materials including proteins (such as whey protein, casein, zein), polysaccharides (like alginate, chitosan), and lipids (such as liposomes, W/O/W emulsions), highlighting roles of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, covalent cross-linking, and interfacial self-assembly. Moreover, four emerging LAB-based delivery systems are classified: (i) surface adsorption via non-covalent interactions, (ii) intracellular loading driven by membrane transport or biosynthesis, (iii) co-encapsulation in hydrogels and emulsions, as well as (iv) engineered LAB capable of in situ synthesis and targeted release. The review also summarizes practical applications in hydrocolloid-rich food systems, such as yogurt, plant-based gels, and functional beverages. These applications highlight LAB's contribution to enhancing structural stability, controlled release, and nutritional functionality. Finally, key challenges are discussed, including the limited compatibility between encapsulating materials and food matrices, insufficient understanding of the interactions between exopolysaccharides and interfaces, and the need for in vivo validation. Based on these insights, future directions are proposed to guide the rational design of next-generation LAB-based delivery systems for precision nutrition and functional food innovation."

This study focuses on NLRP3 expressed in circulatory immune cells, to elucidate the systemic level significance of NLRP3 inflammasome in contributing to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. We therefore, aim to investigate the mRNA expression signature of genes encoding the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in circulatory immune cells and its association with severity of DKD in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from the blood samples of 160 T2DM patients presenting with varying grades of DKD severity. RNA extracted from the PBMCs was used for relative quantification of our target genes using SYBRGreen real-time RT-qPCR. Association of DKD progression with NLRP3 component genes' mRNA expression was analyzed statistically.\n\nRESULTS: Expression of NLRP3, CASP1, and IL1β mRNAs were significantly elevated in DKD; higher HSP72 mRNA expression accompanied normoalbuminuric T2DM. PBMC-derived NLRP3 mRNA levels correlated positively with circulatory monocyte population. Plasma NLRP3 protein and NLRP3 mRNA expressed in PBMCs were associated inversely with decreasing eGFR, independent of diabetes duration, age and sex. Contrastingly, HSP72 mRNA levels declined with decline in eGFR. No association between NLRP3 complex genes and HSP72 mRNA expression in PBMCs was observed, although HSP72 exhibited inverse characteristics to that of NLRP3 complex in the study.\n\nCONCLUSION: A dynamic interplay exists between DKD progression and PBMC-derived mRNA expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and HSP72. At the systemic level, while NLRP3 exasperates inflammation, the protective role of HSP72 is extinguished. Their expression patterns in circulatory immune cells are associated with eGFR decline, tying systemic inflammatory state to worsening kidney disease outcomes."

In this study, we investigate the interplay between adipokines, cytokines and complement proteins in lupus nephritis patients.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment naïve renal biopsy proven (2003 ISN/RPS) LN patients (n = 72) and healthy volunteers (n = 65) were enrolled (January 2017-January 2021). Serum adipokines, cytokines, complement proteins, C- reactive protein, Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) profile, anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-phospholipid antibody (APA) profile were estimated using immunoassay. Serum C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometer.\n\nRESULTS: Elevated adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, progranulin, galectin-3 and pentraxin-3 levels and reduced leptin levels were seen in LN patients when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Serum IL-1β, INFγ, IL-6 and MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated whereas IL-4 levels were prominently reduced in LN patients when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). Serum C1q and CFP levels were significantly reduced in LN patients (p < 0.05). Elevated pentraxin-3 levels directly correlated with long disease duration and high SLEDAI score (p < 0.05). Declining renal function parameters strongly correlated with raised adiponectin, adipsin and resistin levels (p < 0.05). Adipsin levels positively correlated with complement components C3, C4 and CFB levels (p < 0.05). The PCA of serum proteins in LN patients identified three distinct clusters comprising of 37 (Cluster1), 24 (Cluster2) and 1 (Cluster3) patients in each. Adiponectin, resistin and CRP levels were found to be elevated in patients belonging to Cluster1. On the contrary, MCP1 levels were raised in Cluster2 LN patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The association of raised resistin, adipsin, pentraxin-3 levels with deteriorating renal function is suggestive of their potential role in LN pathogenesis. The association between adipokines and complement components indicates the regulatory role of adipokines on complements and vice versa. The identification of patient clusters based on serum protein profile indicated involvement of unique biological profiles in diverse LN pathogenesis mechanism."

However, their clinical potential is often limited by instability under physiological conditions, primarily due to exonucleolytic degradation and structural flexibility. To address these challenges in a model system, we designed a circular RNA aptamer targeting the HIV-1 Tat protein. Enzymatic circularization of the aptamer was performed using T4 RNA ligase, and circularization was confirmed by mobility shift assays and RNase R digestion. Binding affinity was assessed via filter dot blot assay, while structural stability was evaluated using 1D imino proton NMR and CLEANEX-PM experiments. Intracellular stability was monitored using in-cell NMR following transfection into HeLa cells. In our study, the circular aptamer showed approximately tenfold higher binding affinity compared to its linear counterpart, as determined by filter binding assay. NMR analysis indicated improved structural rigidity, preservation of native base pairing, and reduced solvent exchange. Notably, in-cell NMR revealed that the circular aptamer remained detectable up to 18 h post-transfection, whereas the linear aptamer degraded within a few hours. In this system, circularization substantially improved the binding performance and intracellular persistence of the RNA aptamer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying RNA circularization to enhance aptamer functionality in living cells and lay the groundwork for future therapeutic exploration."

PS and falls are prevalent in aging populations, yet their combined impact on long-term stroke risk remains underexplored, particularly in Asian cohorts. This study investigates the association between fall history and incident stroke among middle-aged and older Chinese adults with PS.\n\nMETHODS: Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2015-2018), we analyzed 4605 participants with PS (mean age: 64.8 years). Fall history was assessed by self-reported response to \"Have you fallen in the past two years?\" Stroke was physician-diagnosed via self-report. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models evaluated stroke risk, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), and biomarkers (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed robustness.\n\nRESULTS: Stroke incidence was 9.3 % among fallers and 6.7 % among non-fallers, with a P-value of 0.036. Participants with fall history exhibited a 37 % higher risk of incident stroke compared to non-fallers (adjusted OR: 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.84). The association remained consistent across age, sex, BMI, and most comorbidity subgroups, except for dyslipidemia (interaction P = 0.022). Sensitivity analyses, including multiple imputation for missing data, exclusion of adults >80 years, and removal of hip fracture cases, consistently confirmed the robustness of the findings.\n\nCONCLUSION: Fall history independently predicts stroke risk in individuals with PS, highlighting the potential of fall prevention to reduce stroke burden in this population. This study provides novel evidence of a prolonged stroke risk trajectory in Asian PS cohorts, complementing Western studies focused on short-term post-fall risks. The study has several limitations. Self-reported falls may introduce recall bias and lack mechanistic details. Unmeasured confounders such as diet and medication use constrain causal interpretation. Data constraints prevented differentiation between stroke subtypes."

At 96 h, biofilm matrix components (exoproteins, eDNA, and carbohydrates) and microbial viability (confocal microscopy and PMA-qPCR) were quantified. Relative gene expression analysis was also conducted with species-specific genes (gtfB, sagP, arcA, argG, argH).\n\nRESULTS: For carbohydrates, no significant difference was identified among treatment groups (p>0.05). Protein content for 0.5 % Arg+LRG was significantly lower than LRG (p<0.05). The lowest eDNA content was observed in LRG (p<0.05); while eDNA content of 0.5 % Arg+LRG, was similar to 0.5 % Arg and control (p>0.05). Using confocal imaging, the highest proportion of live cell was found in 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05), followed by 0.25 % Arg+LRG, 3-D biofilm imaging demonstrated increased biomass with smoother architecture in biofilms treated with 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05). 0.5 % Arg+LRG significantly enhanced growth of commensal streptococci (S. gordonii, S. sanguinis) compared to monotherapies and control, while also reducing viability of S. mutans compared to control (p<0.05). Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of S. mutans virulence (gtfB) and upregulation of commensal metabolism (sagP, arcA) for 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The 0.5 % Arg+LRG synbiotics uniquely integrates ecological modulation by regulating biochemical matrix components, promoting commensal enrichment and suppressing cariogenic pathogens.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A deliverable Arg-LRG synbiotics for caries prevention addresses a global public health priority. This strategy aligns with microbial homeostasis principles, presenting a novel paradigm for caries prevention. The Arg-LRG synbiotics can counter the limitations of fluorides to establish a diverse oral microbiome, imparting an ecologically driven approach to caries prevention."

L-based phytoconstituents was developed. We employed machine learning (ML) data pre-processing, screening of differentially expressed transcripts and genes, identification of common transcriptional signatures and pathways and function enrichment analysis of dengue infection; and protein-protein interaction network construction and identification of hub genes. ML data revealed that NS5 mRNA was downregulated by betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside. Moreover, administering these compounds can alleviate host innate immune factor suppression mediated by NS5, thereby exhibiting antiviral activity. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetics studies revealed a potential therapeutic role of betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside phytoconstituents as potent antiviral phytocompounds. MD simulation and post-simulation analysis, including principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation, confirmed the antiviral therapeutic potency of betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside against dengue virus infection. In vitro cytotoxic studies also depicted nontoxic effects of betanin and quercetin hydrate in Vero and CHO cells at a concentration range of 20-0.31 μM.

We assess HDCA's immunomodulatory effects, particularly its Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibition, and discuss potential therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases and sepsis. The review addresses challenges in translating rodent studies to human applications and explores future directions, including the development of HDCA derivatives and integration with microbiome modulation strategies. Ethical and regulatory considerations for microbiome-derived therapeutics are also discussed. We propose that HDCA research may catalyze paradigm shifts in understanding host-microbiome-BA interactions, calling for interdisciplinary approaches to harness its potential fully."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely related to skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR). Currently, there is still a lack of relevant treatments. Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a vital tool for identifying druggable targets in skeletal muscle to develop T2DM treatments.\n\nMETHODS: Potential causative genetic factors in skeletal muscle and blood causally associated with T2DM were identified by SMR analysis. Bayesian colocalisation were used to validate causality. Pleiotropic impact of drug targets was assessed using phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR). Then, targeted overexpression or knockdown of AEBP1 in mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12) and human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) further validated the functional phenotype. Protein docking, co-IP and SPR were used to demonstrate protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Both European and Asian populations revealed that AEBP1 was significantly associated with T2DM and its glycemic profile in blood and skeletal muscle, and was identified as a risk factor. Co-localisation analyses suggest that AEBP1 and T2DM originate from the same genetic variants. Meanwhile, targeted AEBP1 therapy has no potential adverse effects. Furthermore, AEBP1 was significantly expressed in in vivo and in vitro IR models and was consistent with the SMR results. Overexpression of AEBP1 further impaired insulin signalling and glucose transport mechanisms, exacerbating skeletal muscle IR. Targeting AEBP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Protein interaction experiments revealed that PI3K (p110β) is a direct target protein for AEBP1 to exert molecular functions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeting AEBP1 therapy is expected to be a pivotal approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM."

(Xuta) is a new crop whose seed kernels are rich in high-quality proteins and fat; however, they contain antinutrients such as trypsin inhibitors, phytic acid and lectins. Hydrothermal treatment has been shown to significantly reduce these antinutritional factors, leading to the recent approval of Xuta kernels for human consumption by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Despite this, current scientific information is limited, for example, data on the potential genotoxicity of Xuta kernels. In this study, aqueous extracts from three Xuta cultivars were assessed for mutagenicity using the bacterial reverse mutation assay and genotoxicity using the Comet assay with human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Additionally, key antinutritional factors such as lectin activity, trypsin inhibitor activity, and phytic acid content were determined. Hydrothermal treatment significantly reduced antinutritional factors, with lectin activity being completely absent. The results show that the Xuta cultivars tested have no mutagenic or genotoxic potential and are suitable for human consumption after hydrothermal treatment. These findings support the introduction of Xuta kernels as an alternative protein source. Future research should focus on technofunctional properties and applications of Xuta proteins."

This study investigated the roles of phenylalanine (Phe) and cholesterol metabolism in BLCA chemoresistance using integrated omics and computational modeling. Transcriptomic analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets revealed that elevated hexokinase 2 (HK2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression correlates with poor response to cisplatin. Mechanistically, Phe catabolism via phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activated mTORC1 signaling, promoting glycolysis and drug efflux, while cholesterol biosynthesis driven by SREBP2 enhanced ABCG2 transporter activity. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses confirmed causal associations between Phe/cholesterol metabolism and chemoresistance risk. Pharmacological inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase or dietary phenylalanine restriction sensitized BLCA cells to cisplatin both in vitro and in xenograft models. Overexpression of FOLH1 or F7 reversed the inhibitory effects of Phe or cholesterol targeting, respectively, confirming their functional roles in resistance. These findings identify FOLH1 and F7 as mediators of metabolic resistance in BLCA and suggest metabolic targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy. However, whether combined inhibition of Phe and cholesterol pathways provides synergistic benefits over monotherapy remains to be determined in future studies."

This study prepared carboxymethyl starch (CMS)-whey protein isolate (WPI) crosslinked complexes (CMS-WPI/TA) by regulating the interaction in the CMS-WPI system by tannin (TA), and explored the effects of the complexes on the secretion of satiety hormones. The results showed that after the addition of TA, the interaction in CMS-WPI system shifted from electrostatic interactions to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, forming more compact, uniform, and ordered TA-crosslinked complexes. In vitro simulated digestion results indicated that the digestion rates of CMS and WPI in CMS-WPI/TA2 in the upper gastrointestinal tract were reduced to 5.77 % and 26.33 %, respectively, thus permitting most of the CMS and WPI to reach the colon and be degraded by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and amino acids. These metabolic products can stimulate the sustained secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) by L cells, with their secretion increased by 101.02 % and 106.30 % compared to the blank group, respectively. The TA-crosslinked complexes also increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Dialister and Blautia, and reduced the abundance of harmful gut microbiota such as Collinsella. The results of this study provide new insights into regulating starch-protein interactions to improve their resistance to digestion and contribute to the development of functional foods that are beneficial to the human gut microbiota and enhance satiety."

This review summarizes the current knowledge on the impact of the intestinal barrier on UC. The relationship between gut microbiota and the intestinal barrier in UC is also examined. Importantly, this review highlights the advances in the understanding of microbiota-mediated the Trp-AhR pathway in repairing the intestinal barrier. Furthermore, the potential influence of dietary proteins/peptides targeting gut microbiota to regulate the Trp-AhR pathway and alleviate intestinal barrier dysfunction in UC, and the effect of food processing on dietary proteins/peptides to influence gut microbiota and Trp metabolism are discussed. Dietary proteins/peptides could alleviate intestinal barrier impairment in UC by modulating the gut microbiota-mediated Trp-AhR pathway."

The sensory acceptability of bread was not significantly compromised by alfalfa flour inclusion since alterations in protein secondary structure were minor according to FTIR analysis contributing to the maintenance of desirable bread quality. The alfalfa flour quantity had the strongest influence on the content of the investigated nutrients. ASC inclusion was more favourable regarding bread's antioxidant properties compared to GASC, while the usage of sourdough had a positive effect on bread's palatability compared to the standard bread-making process.

This study investigated the changes in gel properties, endogenous enzyme activities, flavor characteristics and metabolic profile during mechanical pre-dehydration of minced fish, compared to the traditional washing process, in order to understand the relationship between changes in endogenous components and processing quality. The results showed that the pre-dehydration process preserved some of the TGase activities (65.96 U/mg) but also some of the proteases and some metabolites (e.g. Histamine and Phosphatidylcholine) that are detrimental to the gelling process, and the gel strength of the obtained surimi gels was lower but acceptable than that of the washed surimi gels (390.97 g·cm and 464.51 g·cm). The gel strength of unwashed surimi was unacceptable (284.03 g·cm). Pre-dehydrated surimi preserved higher levels of amino acids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids than washed surimi, leading to enhanced flavor precursor retention and generation of volatile compounds during gelling. Compared to washed surimi gel, pre-dehydrated surimi gels exhibited stronger warm-over and fishy flavor (Heptanal, Octanal, et al), while retaining more desirable aromas (3-Hexanone, 1-hexanol, et al). This study demonstrates that mechanical pre-dehydration balances gel quality and flavor retention while reducing water usage, offering a sustainable strategy for surimi processing."

FA primer was prepared by mixing ethyl acetate and ethanol as a binary solvent system at solvent ratios of 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, and 4:6. The optimal ratio of ethyl acetate to ethanol was determined by measuring the degree of conversion (DC) and contact angle, combining the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) and fracture pattern immediately and 10,000 thermocycles. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities and adhesive infiltration at the interface were observed, whereas scanning electron microscopy was used to further evaluate nanoleakage and resin rags.\n\nRESULTS: Application of the primer containing a mixed EAC:ET-4:6 solvent resulted in a significant enhancement in the µTBS of both immediate and aging groups, and the contact angle of the demineralized dentin surface. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were further observed the infiltration properties of resin rags in the bonding interface were strengthened. The MMPs activities in the hybrid layer was clearly inhibited, and the degree of nanoleakage at the bonding interface reduced remarkably, thus, it improved the stability and durability of the bond.\n\nCONCLUSION: FA primers containing appropriate ratios of ethanol and ethyl acetate solvents can simplify operation procedures, enhances collagen fiber resistance to enzymatic degradation, and improves hybrid layer sealing, thereby increasing bonding strength.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The FA primer formulated with an ethyl acetate-ethanol mixed solvent aim to achieve high-strength, low leakage, and long-term durable adhesive effects, demonstrating dual functional advantages: Effective collagen crosslinking capacity leading to enhanced bond durability and reduced secondary caries incidence, alongside decreased technique sensitivity. These findings provide novel perspectives for FA primer applications in clinical practice."

Concurrently, TDCPP lowered glutathione (GSH) levels and altered ferroptosis-related protein expression, indicating oxidative stress involvement. In SH-SY5Y cells, co-treatment with TDCPP and MPTP caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and shifted microglia into a pro-inflammatory state-evidenced by increased CD86 expression-and impaired their phagocytic clearance of α-synuclein. These findings demonstrate that TDCPP aggravates PD neurodegeneration through dual mechanisms: ferroptosis-linked oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

To investigate whether sKL may inhibit transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1)-induced EndMT in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (H-dMVECs), cells pretreated with recombinant human sKL and subsequently stimulated with recombinant human TGFβ1 were assessed for morphological changes, gene and protein expression of both endothelial and mesenchymal/myofibroblast markers, and functional contractility through qPCR, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and collagen gel contraction assays, respectively. TGFβ1-treated H-dMVECs underwent significant changes in cell morphology, with loss of endothelial markers (i.e., CD31 and VE-cadherin) and a concomitant increase in the expression of mesenchymal/myofibroblast markers (i.e., α-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen, and S100A4/fibroblast-specific protein 1) and of EndMT-associated transcription factors (Snail1, Twist1, and Zeb1). Moreover, TGFβ1-treated H-dMVECs acquired the ability to contract collagen gel matrices. Pretreatment with sKL significantly attenuated all the aforementioned morphological, molecular, and functional changes, preserving the endothelial phenotype and mitigating myofibroblast-like contractile activity.

    "text": "Sodium valproate (VPA), a widely used antiepileptic drug with good safety profile since many decades. It has increasingly demonstrated therapeutic potential in treating neurological disorders and offering neuroprotection. However, there are neurotoxic properties, underscoring its complex pharmacological profile. VPA works by boosting GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter to reduce nerve excitability and prevent seizures. In bipolar disorder, VPA stabilizes mood by modulating intracellular signaling pathways, including inhibition of histone deacetylases and modulation of G-protein-coupled receptor systems, which influence mood regulation and neuronal plasticity. VPA also prevents migraines by blocking sodium channels and pausing the brain wave disruptions that trigger migraine attacks. Emerging preclinical data suggest that VPA also plays a broader role in promoting neuronal survival, enhancing neuroplasticity, and protecting against neurodegenerative processes. However, despite its therapeutic efficacy, VPA's broad spectrum of action is accompanied by potential neurotoxicities. Chronic use of VPA is associated with adverse effects, including cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and motor dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, excessive inhibition of histone deacetylase, imbalance in neurotransmitters and altered expression of neurotrophic factors are attributed to valproate-induced neurotoxicity. This review explores the neuroprotective effects as well as neurotoxic effects, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse roles. Additionally, we discuss the challenges behind the failure of preclinical neuroprotective data to translate into successful clinical trials. This review aims to provide valuable insights for preclinical researchers designing future studies on VPA."

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that TMAO promotes lipid deposition in both in vivo and in vitro models. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis identified heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β) as a potential downstream effector of TMAO. In both HepG2 cells and HFD-fed mice, TMAO upregulated HSP90β expression, perturbing protein homeostasis. FMO3 Sh reduced HSP90β protein activity and mRNA levels. Meanwhile, proteomic analysis revealed that the TMAO/HSP90β axis disrupts mitochondrial protein homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by MPTP opening, MMP decrease, and ROS production. In vivo, activation of the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by swollen mitochondria with reduced cristae observed via TEM. Notably, FMO3 Sh ameliorated mitochondrial function by suppressing the TMAO/HSP90β axis. In summary, our study demonstrates that the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis promotes MAFLD progression by targeting mitochondrial protein homeostasis and influencing lipid metabolism."

    "text": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review synthesizes recent evidence on nutrition management in neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care, emphasizing the role of preoperative optimization, minimizing perioperative fasting, and personalizing postoperative and intensive care nutritional support. These nutritional interventions can improve functional recovery for neurosurgical and neurocritically ill patients.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: Malnutrition is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes in neurosurgery and neurocritically ill patients. Advancements in preoperative fasting guidelines have shifted towards more flexible approaches, such as allowing clear liquids up to 2 h before surgery and encouraging carbohydrate loading before elective surgery to improve glucose regulation and recovery. Prehabilitation strategies, including protein-rich nutrition and physical activity, improve postoperative recovery, particularly in frail patients. In the neurocritically ill, early enteral nutrition (EN) with low-to-moderate protein and calorie targets improves functional recovery and reduces complications. Recent studies challenge the necessity of prolonged fasting before extubation and ICU procedures. Despite evidence supporting reduced fasting, adherence to protocols remains low.\n\nSUMMARY: Advances in perioperative fasting protocols will likely improve recovery for neurosurgical patients. Early EN improves outcomes in neurocritically ill patients, while excessive calorie and protein intake may be detrimental. Addressing implementation barriers remains crucial for optimizing nutrition in neurocritical care."

    "text": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression is predominantly attributed to podocyte injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain inadequately understood. DKD patients exhibit elevated lactate concentrations due to impaired glucose metabolism. Lactate serves as a substrate for a post-translational modification known as lactylation, which is integral to numerous cellular processes. The study aimed to explore the potential role of lactylation in DKD podocyte injury and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that lactate concentrations were elevated in the plasma of DKD patients, as well as in the serum and renal tissue of diabetic mice. High glucose (HG) resulted in increased lactate accumulation in podocytes, exacerbated podocyte injury and promoted protein lactylation. Protein modification omics demonstrated that LARS1 lactylation was enhanced, specifically at the K970 site, which further aggravated podocyte injury by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis. In vivo transfection with LARS1 siRNA significantly improved renal function and mitigated podocyte injury. Our study identified a novel mechanism linking LARS1 lactylation activity to compromised podocyte autophagy, heightened podocyte injury, and the onset of proteinuria within DKD."

    "text": "Cancer is a metabolic disease influenced by diet, diet-related nutrients, the tumor microenvironment, and metabolic signaling, all of which can significantly affect cancer progression. Although ketogenic diet (KD) has gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects in cancer, the relationship between KD, cancer biology, and metabolic signaling remains underexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of KD on lung cancer biology using an in vivo model developed with AAV and CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in mice fed either a KD or high-carbohydrate diet (HCD). RNA-seq analysis revealed that KD markedly upregulated expression of Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP1A1) in lung cancer tissues compared to HCD. Protein analysis confirmed increased CYP1A1 levels under KD independently of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein levels. Similarly, in A549 and H460 human lung cancer cells treated with β-hydroxybutyrate and low-glucose conditions mimicking KD, CYP1A1 expression was also elevated. Interestingly, we observed that CYP1A1 expression is dependent on AhR activity and nuclear translocation in A549 cells in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of CYP1A1 knockdown A549 cells indicated that CYP1A1 is crucial for regulating cell cycle genes, including cyclin D. These findings highlight the biological significance of CYP1A1 in KD-induced changes in lung cancer, suggesting its role in cell proliferation and tumor development. This study also provides insights into the metabolic signaling underlying the effects of KD on cancer, offering potential directions for future therapeutic strategies."

Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 2(GLIPR2) has been reported to be associated with EndoMT, but whether it can regulate cardiac fibrosis is unknown. This study aimed to explore the contribution of GLIPR2 to post-AMI fibrosis and its underlying mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: Serum protein levels of GLIPR2 were measured in patients with AMI. LAD ligation surgery was used to establish AMI animal models in C57BL/6 J mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-targeted knockdown of GLIPR2 was employed to investigate the effects of GLIPR2 on cardiac fibrosis, cardiac pumping function, and EndoMT after AMI in mice. In human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), GLIPR2 overexpression and knockdown via lentivirus (LV) were utilized to examine angiogenesis, migration, proliferation, and EndoMT under hypoxic conditions.\n\nRESULTS: In the serum of AMI patients, GLIPR2 expression was significantly increased. In mice with AMI, GLIPR2 knockdown reversed EndoMT, attenuated heart fibrosis, and partially restored ventricular pumping function. In a hypoxic cell model, GLIPR2 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, migration, neovascularization, and EndoMT, whereas GLIPR2 knockdown inhibited these processes. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing and recovery studies identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein (PDGFRL)/AKT/mTOR pathway as a critical regulator of GLIPR2-mediated EndoMT.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: GLIPR2 promotes cardiac fibrosis repair by regulating EndoMT through the PDGFRL/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Its inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate cardiac fibrosis and improve ventricular function following AMI."

One approach is the use of preventive therapies to reduce cancer risk; dietary-derived compounds with good safety profiles represent a promising source of potential candidates but translating encouraging preclinical data to successful trials presents significant challenges. Development of curcumin, from the spice turmeric, as a preventive therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is hindered by poor understanding of its mechanism of action. Using patient derived xenografts and ex-vivo 3D-models exposed to clinically achievable curcumin concentrations, we found that it targets proliferating cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) within premalignant adenoma and early-stage cancer tissues, with broad spectrum activity across all molecular subtypes. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that curcumin pushes CSCs towards differentiation over self-renewal, thereby inhibiting tumour development. Evidence suggests these effects involve direct protein binding of curcumin to NANOG, a master regulator of CRC CSCs, and impairment of its transcriptional activity via direct interference with NANOG-DNA binding. Furthermore, curcumin decreased the proportion of proliferating CSCs, defined by NANOG/Ki67 co-expression in patient derived explants and individuals with tumours containing a small fraction of these cells had greatly improved progression-free survival compared to those in the highest quartile for expression. The use of curcumin to minimise this cellular population may yield significant benefit and its clinical evaluation is warranted. Overall, this study provides crucial mechanistic insight, identifying patient populations likely to benefit from curcumin for prevention of sporadic CRC and theragnostic biomarkers for assessing efficacy."

This study aims to investigate whether the administration of IL-10 can suppress disease flares in ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nMETHODS: A UC model was established in mice using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of IL-10. LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were utilized to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\n\nRESULTS: IL-10 administration significantly alleviated clinical symptoms in DSS-induced colitis, including promoting body weight recovery, increasing colon length, and reducing disease activity index scores. IL-10 repaired the intestinal mucosal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, Interferon-γ, and IL-1β), and modulating oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells, IL-10 protected against apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis of control and IL-10 knockout mice showed a significant upregulation of Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) after IL-10 knockout. In contrast, ISG15 expression was downregulated in the LPS + IL-10 group but upregulated in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that ISG15 is a target gene of IL-10 and plays a role in autophagy regulation. Furthermore, IL-10 enhanced autophagy by increasing the protein expression of ATG7, and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, thereby reducing apoptosis and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. Autophagy inhibition with 3-Methyladenine or overexpression of ISG15 diminished IL-10's protective effects.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-10 administration inhibits the progression of UC by activating autophagy and modulating ISG15 expression. In the future, targeted delivery of IL-10 to the intestinal lamina propria may enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects."

The objective of this study was to assess the anti-wrinkle and anti-aging effects of Arazyme in skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts subjected to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and oxidative stress. Keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and fibroblasts (CCD-986sk) were exposed to UVB (15 mJ/cm²) radiation or oxidative stress induced by 2 mM 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), followed by treatment with Arazyme (0.1-0.5 μM) for 24 h. The effects of Arazyme were compared to those of individual treatments with papain, trypsin, or retinol, which served as reference compounds. Key parameters examined included the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13), collagen synthesis, and cellular senescence markers (LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53). Additionally, the impact of Arazyme on cellular signaling pathways, including ERK, JNK, and NF-κB, was assessed. Arazyme significantly suppressed UVB-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells compared to other treatments. In UVB-exposed fibroblasts, Arazyme reduced both mRNA and protein levels of MMPs, while also enhancing procollagen concentration and collagen gene expression. Furthermore, Arazyme inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. In AAPH-stimulated HaCaT cells, Arazyme significantly attenuated the expression of senescence-related markers, including LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53, and decreased the proportion of senescence-positive cells in fibroblasts. Our in vitro findings suggest that Arazyme may help attenuate UVB- and oxidative stress-induced markers of skin aging, indicating its potential as a candidate for further investigation in anti-aging skincare research."

The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of Qiukui Taoren Recipe (QT), and the potential molecular mechanisms in AKI using network pharmacology prediction, in vivo and in vitro experiment. There were 42 active components of QT detected by HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, and network pharmacology showed that these active components mainly could act with 63 core targets such as TNF-α, Caspase-3, BCL2, STAT3, PPARγ, and regulated 110 signaling pathways for alleviating AKI. In addition, QT reduced periocular oedema, renal malformations and size reduction, partially restore renal excretory function, and reduced the accumulation of proteinuria in zebrafish AKI model induced by caristolochic acid (AA). QT could upregulate the mRNA expression of Nephrin and oxidative stress genes (Nrf2, HO-1, PPARγ), and downregulate inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, Caspase-3, P53). Furthermore, QT inhibited ROS elevation and apoptosis activated by cisplatin (CDDP) in HEK293T cells. Western blotting results showed that QT could enhance the protein expression of nephrin, and inhibited the protein expression of Kim-1, IL-18, NLRP3, STAT3, P53 and Caspase-3. Overall, these results indicated the protective effect of QT against AKI was due to the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation-and apoptosis-related pathways."

Although lactylation has garnered increasing attention, its role in TAD remains poorly understood.\n\nMETHODS: Lactylation-related genes (LRGs) were obtained from the MsigDB database. Lactylation-related hub genes (LRHGs) were identified by intersecting LRGs with differentially expressed genes and WGCNA results. Lactylation was assessed in a β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced mouse model and human aortic tissues. Two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from the GEO database were utilized to evaluate lactylation patterns across cell populations and intercellular communication networks. Biomarkers were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Elevated lactylation levels were observed in both TAD tissues and synthetic phenotype vascular smooth muscle cells. Through integrated analysis, we identified 12 LRHGs, which includes LDHA. In the BAPN-induced mouse model, LDHA inhibitors (Oxamate and FX11) significantly reduced mortality rates and decreased aortic lactate levels and protein lactylation. ScRNA-seq analytic results revealed that monocytes and macrophages exhibited the highest lactylation activity, which likely enhanced their inflammatory pathways and intercellular communication. ROC analysis showed the lowest AUC of 12 LRHGs is 0.8893.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of lactylation-related hub genes in TAD, identifying potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers, which provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TAD."

The neural and behavioral mechanisms for such primate-typical food preferences remain poorly understood, despite their importance for human health and their targeting by pharmacological obesity treatments. Here, we review a series of experiments that investigated how the biologically critical properties of foods-their nutrients (sugar, fat, protein) and oral-sensory qualities (viscosity, oral sliding friction)-influence food preferences in monkeys and humans. In an economic nutrient-choice paradigm, macaques flexibly trade nutrients and oral-sensory food qualities against varying food amounts, consistent with the assignment of subjective values. Nutrient-value functions that link objective nutrient content to subjective values accurately model these preferences, predict choices across contexts, and explain individual differences. The monkeys' aggregated choice patterns resulting from their nutrient preferences lead to daily nutrient balances that deviate from dietary reference points, resembling suboptimal human eating patterns when exposed to high-calorie foods. To investigate the sensory basis underlying nutrient values, we developed novel engineering tools that quantify food textures on oral surfaces, using fresh pig tongues. Oral-texture (i.e., mouthfeel) parameters, including viscosity and sliding friction, were shown to mediate monkeys' preferences for high-fat foods. When translated to human subjects, this approach revealed a neural mechanism for preferring high-fat foods from oral texture in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-a key reward system of the brain. Importantly, human OFC responses to oral sliding friction in individual subjects-measured in the MRI scanner-predicted subsequent fat intake in a naturalistic, life-like eating test. These findings suggest that a primate nutrient-reward paradigm offers a promising approach for investigating the behavioral and neural mechanisms for human-typical food reward and food choice, to advance understanding of human eating behavior, overeating, and obesity."

The diagnostic process for HVL is frequently hindered by the disease's nonspecific clinical presentation and the inherent limitations of existing serological assays, which often exhibit suboptimal sensitivity and specificity, predisposing to diagnostic inaccuracies. Developing of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays is crucial for effective HVL control in Brazil, enabling early disease detection and improving treatment outcomes. To enhance diagnostic capabilities, we evaluated the performance of a chimeric protein designed from B-lymphocyte cell epitopes identified through immunoproteomic analysis in serological tests for detecting L. infantum infection. Under the experimental conditions, the chimeric protein demonstrated the following diagnostic performance: 100 % specificity against control samples, 94.12 % specificity against Chagas disease samples, and 100 % sensitivity for HVL-positive individuals. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the following performance metrics: area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9960, 100 % sensitivity, and 97.10 % overall specificity, significantly exceeding the performance of the L. infantum soluble antigen (SLiA) ELISA.

Immunomodulatory approaches, including phosphodiesterase inhibition and cytokine regulation, demonstrate potential in optimizing host immune responses. Novel mechanisms such as ferroptosis inhibition and pyroptosis modulation present promising therapeutic avenues. The review also examines the role of established drugs being repurposed for TB treatment, including statins and antidepressants. While preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of various HDTs, the review emphasizes the need for careful consideration of host-pathogen interactions and potential immunological approaches. The complexity of TB pathophysiology necessitates a personalized approach to HDT implementation. Future research directions should focus on clinical validation, optimal dosing strategies, and combination approaches with standard antimicrobial therapy. This review underscores the potential of HDTs to address drug resistance and persistent infections, while highlighting the importance of continued investigation into their safety and efficacy across diverse patient populations."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: The accumulation of excess lipids within skeletal muscle, which can progress to overt myosteatosis, is more common among persons with HIV (PWH) and contributes to the development of frailty, impaired mobility, and metabolic dysregulation. Excess free fatty acids (FFA) can impair muscle mitochondrial function, which is reflected in higher plasma levels of several acylcarnitines. We assessed the relationship between CT-determined skeletal muscle density and plasma acylcarnitines among male PWH on long-term antiretroviral therapy.\n\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of two prospectively recruited clinical cohorts with harmonized study procedures and imaging.\n\nMETHODS: Linear regression models assessed the relationship of fasting plasma acylcarnitines measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and skeletal muscle density measured by CT, adjusted for study cohort, age, body mass index (BMI), CD4 + cell count, visceral adipose tissue area, total plasma triglycerides, and insulin resistance.\n\nRESULTS: Among 160 male PWH (median age 54 years, median BMI 30.5 kg/m 2 , and 41% Black), higher plasma levels of short-chain acetylcarnitine (C2 : 0) and isobutyrylcarnitine (C4 : 0), the medium chain hexanoylcarnitine (C6 : 1), and the long chain myristoylcarnitine (C14 : 0) and palmitoylcarnitine (C16 : 0) were associated with skeletal muscle density, while others approached significance. None of the C3 and C5 acylcarnitines, largely the products of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, were associated with skeletal muscle density.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CT measurements of skeletal muscle density in male PWH appear to identify impaired mitochondrial FFA oxidation as measured by plasma FFA metabolites, which could serve as a biomarker for future intervention studies to mitigate skeletal muscle deterioration and metabolic dysregulation."

In this work, a S, Pd modified hollow CoNiMnFe Prussian blue analogue nanocomposite (Pd-S-CNMF) was prepared as multifunctional nanoplatform for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided for combined cascade catalyzed therapy and low-temperature photothermal therapy. We found that the co-modification of S and Pd on CNMF could enhance the responsive feature the as-prepared nanocomposite to acidic environment, which endowed the Pd-S-CNMF with multiple enzyme mimicking activities and enhanced NIR light absorption. To construct efficient nanoplatform for prostate cancer therapy, a HSP 90 protein inhibitor, tanespimycin was loaded on Pd-S-CNMF (17Pd-S-CNMF) to inhibit the level of HSP 90 protein, thus increasing the outcome of subsequent photothermal therapy. The constructed 17Pd-S-CNMF is expected to remodel tumor microenvironment (TME), generate sufficient highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia to enhance the efficacy of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). In addition, comparing to the pristine CNMF and S doped CNMF, the as-prepared Pd-S-CNMF possessed superior magnetic TME sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance. Benefiting from these amazing properties, the as-prepared 17Pd-S-CNMF could effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in vitro and vivo. Our findings provide a paradigm for construction of efficient nanocomposites as nanoplatform for cancer diagnose and treatment."

Therefore, we performed a systematic review with pairwise and network meta-analyses to determine the efficacy of different modes of exercise training for improving inflammation in patients with T2D. A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 2024 using four main key words including \"exercise,\" \"cytokines,\" \"type 2 diabetes,\" and \"randomization.\" Randomized control or clinical trials investigating the effects of any exercise training mode, including aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), AT + RT, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and HIIT + RT on inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, or adiponectin in patients with T2D were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects models. Overall, 60 studies involving 3339 patients with T2D were included. Compared to control, exercise training effectively reduced IL-6 [SMD: -0.58], TNF-α [SMD: -0.62], CRP [SMD: -0.78], and leptin [SMD: -0.27], and increased adiponectin [SMD: 0.35]. Based on network meta-analysis, AT reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and leptin and increased adiponectin; and AT + RT reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, and increased adiponectin. However, RT, HIIT, and HIIT + RT did not change any inflammatory markers as compared with controls. Exercise training is an effective approach for lowering chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with T2D; specifically, AT and AT + RT appear to be more effective than RT, HIIT, or HIIT + RT."

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays. RIP and MeRIP assays were conducted to investigate the interaction between YTHDF1 and TOP2A mRNA. Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation. Additionally, YTHDF1 knockdown reduced TOP2A protein expression and mitigated hypoxia-induced PASMCs dysfunction, while TOP2A overexpression reversed these protective effects. Mechanistically, TOP2A activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, driving PASMCs proliferation and migration. Collectively, this study identifies YTHDF1-mediated m6A modification as a key regulator of TOP2A expression, which promotes PASMCs dysfunction and vascular remodeling in PH via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."

Therefore, improving treatment methods is essential for the management of this cancer. Turmerones, which are the main volatile natural components of Curcuma longa Linn, have shown a number of beneficial biological activities both in vitro and in vivo. However, because of their hydrophobicity, their delivery methods need substantial improvement. Niosomes, which are made of non-ionic surfactants, have shown promising results in drug delivery systems (DDSs). Due to their appropriate encapsulation rate, stability, bioavailability, and predictable release patterns, they could be useful tools in DDSs. In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of treatment with turmerone-loaded niosomes on cancerous phenotypes of two HCC cell line in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMETHOD: Turmerone-loaded niosomes were synthesized through thin-film hydration method and characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The impact of turmerone-loaded niosomes on Huh-7 and Hep3B cells were assessed in vitro in term of gene expression, protein production, apoptosis, cell cycle, and some functional assessments such as colony formation potential and migration. Furthermore, tumorigenesis potential of the turmerone-loaded niosomes treated hepatoma cells was assessed in an in vivo model using nude mice.\n\nRESULTS: Our in vitro experiments showed that turmerone-loaded niosomes induced apoptosis (26.04 % for Huh-7 and 29.7 % for Hep3B) and cell cycle arrest in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells. Additionally, turmerone-loaded niosomes treatment down-regulated EMT-inducing genes and significantly decreased the EMT phenotype, as well as decreased colony formation capacity in both cell lines (surviving fraction of 0.27 for Huh-7 and 0.032 for Hep3B). In vivo study showed that upon transplantation, hepatoma cells which have been pre-treated with turmerone-loaded niosomes have less growth rate and produced smaller tumors with significantly few proliferating cells in nude mice.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that turmerone delivery through niosome have higher anti-cancer potentials in comparison to free-turmerone treatment on HCC cell line. Therefore, this approach could have a promising therapeutic potential in combination with other approved clinical settings for HCC treatment."

Excess extracellular PPi (ePPi) inhibits mineralization and affected children prematurely shed deciduous teeth and often suffer weakness and rickets. Yet, HPP severity is greatest among all dento-osseous disorders and not fully explained by autosomal dominant versus autosomal recessive inheritance involving >470 ALPL mutations. Discordance of HPP phenotype sometimes manifests even among full siblings sharing an identical ALPL genotype. Herein, a girl's markedly discordant HPP featured at presentation life-threatening hypercalcemia, failure-to-thrive, and renal compromise. Subsequent pseudotumor cerebri syndrome caused blindness, and then craniosynostosis required cranial vault reconstruction. However, she was not deformed, had moderate hypophosphatasemia, normal plasma PLP level, and mild radiographic features of HPP rickets. Elevated plasma N-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) suggested malignancy, but corrected after kidney transplantation. HPP was diagnosed when whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous ALPL c.1034C>T, p.A345V found in mild pediatric HPP and transmitted by her mother who considered herself well. Genes conditioning ePPi formation and underlying other skeletal diseases were intact. Hypercalcemia, unresponsive to bone antiresorptive drugs, corrected promptly with asfotase alfa TNSALP supplementation therapy. Her markedly discordant findings highlight genotype/phenotype plasticity for pediatric HPP, and her clinical course importance for early diagnosis."

We collected MHM (3-6 months postpartum) from 32 healthy mothers with different parities and delivery modes. Then, GC-MS and LC-MS were used to perform an untargeted metabolomic study. A clear distinction can be observed in terms of MHM metabolites of mothers with different delivery modes and parities with a 95% confidence interval. A total of 119 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified in MHM of women with different delivery modes. Metabolic pathway analyses indicated that these DEMs were mainly associated with fatty acid biosynthesis. The higher abundances of these DEMs in MHM of cesarean women may be due to the differing levels of cortisol and oxytocin between mothers with different delivery modes. Meanwhile, 284 DEMs were identified in MHM of women with different parities. These DEMs were primarily related to ABC transporters, center carbon metabolism in cancer, and D-amino acid metabolism. These findings highlighted the impact of delivery mode and parity on HM metabolite composition. Further research is needed to explore the long-term health implications of these metabolic differences and optimize infant nutrition strategies."

The chimera was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli and demonstrated strong antigenicity, effectively recognizing sera from hamsters infected with diverse Leptospira serovars, indicating its non-serovar-specific nature (P < 0.001). ELISA assays were conducted using 80 human sera previously characterized by MAT.

This study aimed to investigate the role of RD5 in the development of hepatic steatosis in individuals with obesity and explore the detailed mechanisms involved. Protein expression was evaluated via Western blot analysis, whereas hepatic lipid deposition was examined via Oil Red O staining and triglyceride quantification. Autophagosomes were detected via MDC staining. Our findings indicated that RD5 treatment normalized lipogenic lipid accumulation, fatty acid uptake, oxidation, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in palmitate-treated primary hepatocytes. As a cytoprotective signaling pathway, RD5 treatment increased the expression of SIRT6 and autophagy markers, such as those involved in LC3 conversion and p62 degradation. The beneficial effects of RD5 on hepatic lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and ER stress were negated by SIRT6 small interfering RNA or 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, RD5 administration decreased hepatic steatosis, apoptosis, and ER stress in the livers of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In line with the in vitro results, RD5 treatment elevated SIRT6 and autophagy levels in the livers of HFD-fed mice. These novel findings suggest that RD5 improves hepatic lipid metabolism, apoptosis and ER stress through SIRT6/autophagy signaling, thereby attenuating hepatic steatosis. RD5 may have therapeutic potential for treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with minimal side effects."

The MTS-hydrogel platform was subjected to PEFs varying in pulse width and electric field (EF) strength. Treated MTS were monitored and evaluated for viability and proliferation (Live/Dead imaging, XTT Cell Viability Assay), and migration (brightfield imaging) over 5 days post-treatment. In vitro experimentation was validated with a multi-layered spheroid finite element model, evaluating transmembrane potential (TMP), pore density, and pore formation across the spheroid layers. MTS exposed to longer pulse widths (5, 100 μs) and higher EFs (2000, 2500 V/cm) experienced a complete ablation. Smaller pulse widths and lower EFs produced partial ablations initially reducing the MTS, but unable to prevent the MTS from recuperating. Similarly shown with the computational model, a TMP was accomplished through the MTS, inducing electroporation; however, pore formation was dictated by the increase in pulse width and EF beyond the superficial layer. EFs of 2000 V/cm and above severely constrained the migration independent of pulse width."

    "text": "Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) prediction plays a crucial role in the drug discovery process by evaluating the strength of the interaction between a drug and its biological target, which is often a protein. Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models. A case study on cancer-related protein interactions from the DrugBank database further demonstrates the framework's precision in identifying key drug-protein affinities, reinforcing its potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing."

    "text": "Pathway enrichment analysis is a valuable tool for researchers aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying any specific drug or disease associated gene lists derived from biological assays or large-scale genome (omics) experiments. By employing this method, researchers can pinpoint biological pathways that exhibit a higher level of enrichment for a given set of genes than would be anticipated by random chance. These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway. Here we propose a novel method to enrich the molecular pathways and prioritize them based on their importance and crucial role in the biological function using the graph and evidence-based approach and customized datasets called PathwayMind. It includes 2648 pathways, 4539 biological events, 2465847 protein-protein interactions and 124717 gene-to-pathway relationships and the role of 3510 unique initial genes in 11,992 molecular pathways. The current manuscript comprises three major steps: The first step is about the data extraction and datasets creation for pathway enrichment, and the second steps comprises pathway perturbation analysis to identify most perturbed biological pathways and the third steps includes validation of this approach along with standalone tools and visualization algorithms which disclose the molecular involvement and improve the interpretability of the results. The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest. The current PathwayMind tool and its datasets could be very useful for the molecular scientists and system biologists who are interested to understand the therapeutic effects of their drugs or understanding the involvement of biological pathways for specific gene sets which does not require any prior bioinformatics training."

    "text": "Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug discovery and can reduce drug development costs. Recent deep learning-based DTI predictions have demonstrated promising performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) The over-reliance on the extraction of local features and insufficient learning of global features limit the model's performance. (ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human. Case studies further demonstrate that the model provides valuable insights for drug discovery. In addition, our model provides molecular-level interpretability, which can provide more scientifically meaningful guidance."

    "text": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disorder with a complex pathogenesis that requires combination therapies rather than monotherapies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exhibit inherently efficient delivery to the liver and can be engineered to carry various therapeutic substances, making them promising agents. In this study, EVs were engineered to display fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on their surface and encapsulate miR-223 (223/F-EVs), aiming to improve steatosis and alleviate inflammation and fibrosis, respectively. Introducing the 223/F-EVs into human liver cell lines significantly reduced both basal and induced levels of lipid storage, inflammation, and fibrosis markers. Furthermore, using an FGF21-blocking antibody or miR-223 inhibitor effectively diminished the efficacy of the 223/F-EVs, confirming the essential roles of FGF21 and miR-223 in these processes. In a Choline-Deficient, l-Amino acid-defined, High-Fat Diet (CDAHFD)-fed mouse model, intravenously administered 223/F-EVs demonstrated liver-preferential delivery and a marked reduction in the MASH phenotype without compromising bone density, unlike conventional FGF21 treatment. Collectively, 223/F-EVs convey FGF21 and miR-223 exclusively to the liver, offering strategic advantages by mitigating MASH progression via multiple pathways. This study lays a solid foundation for further investigation of engineered EVs as a transformative therapeutic approach for treating MASH."

SjMEP-40 was fragmented into three distinct portions-SjMEP-40 N (N-terminal), SjMEP-40 M (middle), and SjMEP-40C (C-terminal)-to determine which segment provides the best diagnostic performance compared to the whole antigen (SjMEP-40 W) for both IgG and IgM detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyze archived samples from various endemic areas in the Philippines, all previously confirmed either positive or negative for Schistosoma japonicum infection through microscopy or stool PCR. Additionally, cross-reactivity tests were conducted with other parasitic infections, including paragonimiasis, clonorchiasis, and opisthorchiasis. IgG ELISA results revealed that SjMEP-40 M has the sensitivity (82.24 %) and specificity (95.97 %). On the other hand, SjMEP-40 N showed the highest sensitivity (85.5 %) and positivity rates in IgM ELISA with both microscopy and PCR-positive samples. Overall, SjMEP-40 M showed the best diagnostic results for IgG evaluation, whereas SjMEP-40 N is the fragment responsible for antigen detection at the early stage of the disease, as shown by the IgM ELISA results.

Type II collagen was administered to DBA/1J mice to induce CIA. Vehicle or remdesivir was injected subcutaneously three times a week. During 7 weeks of treatment, the arthritis score and incidence were evaluated twice a week. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging were used to evaluate CD4 + T cells in the spleen. FLSs from patients with RA were stimulated in vitro with remdesivir and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and western blotting was used to measure the expression of STING and necroptosis-related markers.\n\nRESULTS: Remdesivir administration suppressed the incidence and progression of arthritis in mice with CIA. Histological analysis revealed lower inflammation and cartilage damage scores in remdesivir-treated than in vehicle groups. Interleukin (IL)-17 + CD4 + T-cell differentiation was inhibited in the remdesivir-treated group. Furthermore, IL-17/-6/-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein -1, and TNF-α expression was reduced in the remdesivir group. In vitro, remdesivir suppressed the expression of STING, nuclear factor-κB, RIPK3, and phosphorylated MLKL in RA-FLSs under TNF-α stimulation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The antiviral agent remdesivir suppressed arthritis by regulating Th cell differentiation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, the STING pathway, and necroptosis."

This work investigated treatment effects between women and men in the PARAGLIDE-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF) trial.\n\nMETHODS: In this prespecified subgroup analysis, we examined outcomes according to sex in the PARAGLIDE-HF trial. The primary endpoint was time-average proportional change in amino terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline through Weeks 4 and 8. We also examined secondary outcomes and tolerability.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 242 women (52%) and 224 men (48%) were randomized. Women had significantly higher LVEF, worse renal function, and less comorbidities than men. In the overall population, the time-averaged reduction in NT-proBNP was significantly greater for sacubitril/valsartan (sac/val) than valsartan (ratio of change 0.85, 95% CI, 0.73-0.999). When examined according to sex, the time-averaged reduction in NT-proBNP was numerically greater with sac/val in both women (ratio of change = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.69-1.070) and men (ratio of change 0.84, 95% CI, 0.67-1.05) with no differential treatment effect (P interaction = .91). Similarly, the secondary hierarchical endpoint favored sac/val over valsartan in both women and men but was not statistically significant. Study drug dosage levels were similar across women and men and there were no sex-specific differences in the incidence of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with mildly reduced or preserved EF >40% and a recent worsening HF event, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sac/val vs valsartan were similar in both women and men, suggesting consistent effects across appropriately selected patients regardless of sex. Future prospective studies are needed to further evaluate sex-specific differences in treatment response of HFpEF therapies.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF; NCT03988634; https://www.\n\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov/study/NCT03988634."

A common form of CKD is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most inherited genetic kidney disease and affects greater than 12.5 million individuals globally. Given that there are over 400 pathogenic PKD1/PKD2 mutations in patients with ADPKD, relying solely on small molecule drugs targeting a single signaling pathway has not been effective in treating ADPKD. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are naturally released by cells from the kidneys and the urinary tract, and uEVs isolated from non-disease sources have been reported to carry functional polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), the respective products of PKD1 and PKD2 genes that are mutated in ADPKD. uEVs from non-disease sources, as a result, have the potential to provide a direct solution to the root of the disease by delivering functional proteins that are mutated in ADPKD. To test our hypothesis, we first isolated uEVs from healthy mice urine and conducted a comprehensive characterization of uEVs. Then, PC1 levels and EV markers CD63 and TSG101 of uEVs were confirmed via ELISA and Western blot. Following characterization of uEVs, the in vitro cellular uptake, inhibition of cyst growth, and gene rescue ability of uEVs were demonstrated in kidney cells. Next, upon administration of uEVs in vivo, uEVs showed bioavailability and accumulation in the kidneys. Lastly, uEV treatment in ADPKD mice (Pkd1"

Results showed that SDF at a low ratio (≤ 3.5) induced a compact matrix structure, which decreased protein digestibility to 67.70 % and total amino acids release to 140.67 mg/g protein, respectively. The compaction of the noodle matrix could be attributed to the promotion of cross-linking between D-type low molecular weight gluten and γ-gliadin by a small amount of SDF, reducing lacunarity from 0.28 to 0.16. A high SDF ratio (>3.5) induced a more fragmented matrix structure, increasing protein digestibility to 76.88 %. Notably, at a higher SDF ratio (>4.5), the concentration-dependent static quenching on enzymatic sites of SDF became prominent, slightly reducing gastric protein digestibility. In summary, an SDF ratio of 2.0-2.5 helps to reduce the inhibition of SDF on protein digestion."

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation. These findings provided practical applications for improving the taste of wine and offered a theoretical foundation for modulating undesirable tastes in other beverage systems."

    "text": "OBJECTIVES: Cardiac troponins (cTn) are used to detect and quantify acute cardiomyocyte injury. In patients presenting with symptoms that could indicate myocarditis, elevated cTn concentrations typically mandate cardiac catheterization and heart muscle biopsy or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Accordingly, increased cTn levels due to macrotroponin - a complex between patient anti-troponin autoantibodies and cTn - could lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions. In athletes, ensuring cardiac health after infection like COVID-19 is critical, but the occurrence of false-positive cTn levels post-COVID-19 remains unknown.\n\nMETHODS: This observational study prospectively included 35 healthy athletes (aged 16-75 years; 19 females, 16 males) who underwent post-COVID check-ups during 2022-2023. Athletes' cTn levels were measured using four different hs-cTn routine immunoassays. If discrepancies were noted between assays, further testing for macrotroponin was conducted using protein G column, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and anti-troponin autoantibody immunoassay.\n\nRESULTS: Seventeen athletes had normal cTn levels across all assays, while 18 (51 %) had elevated cTn, mostly cTnI. Despite elevated cTn levels, no signs of myocarditis or other cardiac conditions were found on electrocardiography, echocardiography, or CMR. Macrotroponin was confirmed among 16 of these 18 athletes. Further, IgG anti-troponin autoantibodies correlated significantly with the levels of the two most-commonly affected assays: hs-cTnI-Siemens Atellica and hs-cTnI-Abbott Alinity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID-19, nearly half of athletes showed elevated cTnI levels due to interference from macrotroponin. Awareness among physicians and laboratorians of this analytical confounder can avoid unnecessary invasive or costly diagnostic tests in athletes with false-positive cTnI levels after COVID-19."

    "text": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study used data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database and compared neuropathologic, neuropsychiatric, motor, and neuropsychological features between those with and without chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change (CTE-NC).\n\nMETHODS: Data were obtained from the NACC database from 2014 to December 2024, with the only inclusion criterion being evaluation for CTE-NC. Participants with CTE-NC were identified and matched approximately 1:4 to those without CTE-NC on demographics (age, education, sex) and staging of Alzheimer and Lewy body neuropathology. Chi-square tests and analyses of covariance (covarying for cognitive symptom duration, time to death, and cognitive diagnosis) compared neuropathologic features, history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuropsychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism features, and neuropsychological scores between groups.\n\nRESULTS: CTE-NC was present in 0.8% of participants (29/3,845) since 2014. Matching on a 1:4 ratio was achieved for 22 individuals and 1:3 for an additional 3, yielding a total comparison sample of 25 with CTE-NC and 97 without. All but 1 individual with CTE-NC were male with a mean age of 74.7 years (SD = 8.0). Moderate-to-severe Alzheimer neuropathology (54.0%) was common in those with CTE-NC while comorbid cortical or limbic Lewy inclusions were less frequent (8.0%). Compared with those without CTE-NC, those with CTE-NC had higher rates of hippocampal sclerosis (40.0% vs 9.6%;\n\nDISCUSSION: CTE-NC was rare in NACC since 2014. Those with CTE-NC did not differ in clinical symptoms but had higher rates of hippocampal sclerosis, other tauopathies, and TDP-43 inclusions. In this clinicopathologic investigation using in vivo clinical data, although NACC lacks CTE-NC severity/distribution and repetitive head impact data for sensitivity analyses. Larger in vivo clinicopathologic studies are greatly needed to correlate CTE-NC with clinical features."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease closely linked to intestinal mucosal microcirculatory dysfunction. Sweroside (SOS), a natural iridoid glycoside derived from plants such as Swertia mussotii, Swertia pseudochinensis, and Lonicera japonica, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. Yet, its therapeutic potential and mechanisms in UC remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SOS on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC and its underlying mechanisms.\n\nMETHODS: A DSS-induced UC mouse model was established to evaluate the efficacy of SOS. Inflammatory cytokine levels, intestinal barrier function (assessed via MUC2 immunofluorescence, FITC-dextran permeability, and tight junction protein analysis), and mucosal microcirculation (measured by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging) were examined. Angiogenesis and endothelial cell (EC) damage were analyzed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. Transcriptomics and molecular docking were utilized to investigate SOS-mediated pathways, with subsequent validation by qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, a cellular injury model was generated by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with DSS. Cellular inflammatory and angiogenesis-related factors were quantified via ELISA, while migration and angiogenesis capabilities of HUVECs were assessed through scratch and tube-forming assays. The expression of the VEGF and Hippo pathway-related proteins was determined by western blot.\n\nRESULTS: SOS significantly ameliorated UC symptoms, reducing weight loss, diarrhea, and DAI scores while suppressing inflammatory infiltration and cytokine release. SOS enhanced intestinal barrier integrity via tight junction upregulation and improved microcirculation by attenuating EC injury and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, SOS regulated the VEGF and Hippo pathways, a key regulator of angiogenesis, as confirmed by transcriptomics and molecular docking. In vitro, SOS protected HUVECs from DSS-induced inflammation and angiogenesis, confirming the improvement of mucosal microcirculation by modulating VEGF and Hippo pathways.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SOS ameliorates DSS-induced UC by impacting the VEGF and Hippo pathways, thereby suppressing ECs' angiogenesis, restoring mucosal microcirculation, and mitigating intestinal inflammation. These findings highlight SOS as a promising therapeutic candidate for UC."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Whole blood sample consists of red and white blood cells, platelets, nucleic acids, proteins, and other metabolites. However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s). The DG-PSM promotes the realization of plasma separation and detection on lab-on-a-chip. We believe DG-PSM can be integrated into more detection devices to benefit mankind in remote areas and developing countries."

This longitudinal study enrolled 89 CKD patients. A total of 71 pesticides, including 9 carbamate pesticides, were detected in the urine samples. Our findings indicated that higher concentrations of carbamates, possibly from the diet, may significant be associated with oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial energy metabolism in CKD patients. Integrating machine learning approach identified l-glutamine (L-Glu), 3-chlorotyrosine, and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine as potential biomarkers of pesticide exposure, with an area under the curve of >0.903 based on machine learning- a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Both CKD and pesticide exposure were associated with abnormalities in amino acid and energy metabolism. Key metabolites such as L-cysteine, Acetyl-CoA, L-Glu, and L-histidine were identified as endogenous markers capable of predicting changes in both renal dysfunction and pesticide exposure among CKD patients. Detecting exposure-related metabolic alterations through metabolomics enables early identification and aids in the understanding and potential prevention of kidney disease progression. This study further can explore the clinical applicability and improve predictive value of these biomarkers."

However, current delivery methods are either invasive or inefficient due to low bioavailability. Therefore, an alternative route of administration is needed. Pulmonary delivery is a promising option as it can provide high bioavailability and a rapid onset of action. Beyond systemic analgesia, NAL has also shown local therapeutic benefits in the lungs. This study aimed to develop inhalable NAL powders using spray drying, with leucine and human serum albumin (HSA) as dispersion enhancers. The resulting powders were amorphous and contained <4 % residual solvent by mass. The spray dried particles were spherical, 3-4 µm large, and exhibited corrugated surface. Spray dried NAL alone were inhalable, with a fine particle fraction <5 µm (FPF) at 25 %. The addition of HSA improved the FPF to 33 % and 37 % for 10 % and 20 % w/w HSA, respectively. Similarly, the FPF increased to 39 % after adding 10 % w/w leucine, reaching a maximum of 47 % with 20 % w/w leucine. The latter formulation also demonstrated good chemical and physical stability after one month of storage at 25 °C under both 30 % and 60 % relative humidity. These formulations can be used as a platform to deliver NAL and other opioid analgesics by inhalation."

Epidermal growth factor-like repeats and discoidin I-like domains 3 (EDIL3) is a matrix protein associated with the onset and progression of various diseases, yet its role in PH remains unexamined. This research aims to assess the expression of EDIL3 in PH and to investigate its underlying mechanisms in the condition. Our results indicated that EDIL3 levels are elevated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), as well as in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) compared to normoxia-treated controls. Additionally, a mouse model of PH induced by SU5416 along with hypoxia (Su/Hx) also expressed elevated EDIL3 levels. We discovered that EDIL3 knockdown diminished the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanically, we identified an interaction between EDIL3 and integrin αVβ3. The regulation of PASMCs proliferation by EDIL3 was disrupted by cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide that serves as a potent and selective inhibitor of integrin αVβ3. Furthermore, recombinant EDIL3 significantly increased the level of p-ERK1/2, an effect that was blocked by cilengitide, while p-p38 and p-JNK levels remained unchanged. In summary, our study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy for treating PAH and highlights a new serum biomarker for its diagnosis."

Cell-based assays for antigen-specific antibodies and IgG binding to the surface of live hippocampal neurons were performed on 13 CSFs and 65 sera, many sampled longitudinally, from 34 Vietnamese children with JE. Three month outcomes were scored according to a pediatric post-encephalitis scale; clinical features focussed on new onset symptoms during the follow-up, blinded to antibody results. Ten/34 children (29 %) had serum antibodies against known neuronal-surface antigens, 4 NMDAR, 4 CASPR2, 1 GABAAR and 1 LGI1, detected from day 23 after onset. In addition, 8/10 (80 %) of these children and 13/24 (54 %) others had antibodies that bound in a distinctive pattern to live hippocampal neurons (HN-Abs), four detected on days 9-12. A relapse was only considered possible in 5 patients, two with specific neuronal surface antibodies (NSAbs). Neither specific NSAbs (p = 1.00) nor HN-Abs (p = 1.00).were more common in patients with possible relapse than in those with unlikely relapse. There was a modest trend towards worse outcome scores in patients with known NSAbs than in the remaining patients (p = 0.089). Antibodies to neuronal surface proteins, known and unknown, are common in children after JE. Caution is urged in defining post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis on the basis of a positive neuronal antibody and new onset symptoms or deterioration following recovery from JE, or in initiating immunotherapy without confirmatory evidence of a time-dependent encephalitic illness defined by published guidelines."

    "text": "The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is well-known for its exceptionally high taurine content, but the mechanisms underlying taurine biosynthesis remain largely unexplored. Thecysteamine (AET) pathway is one of the primary metabolic routes involved in taurine biosynthesis, and its role in mollusk taurine synthesis has garnered increasing recognition. In the present study, a cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) homolog CgADO, the central enzyme of the AET pathway, was identified in C. gigas, which contained a typical PCO_ADO domain. The transcripts of CgADO were constitutively expressed in examined oyster tissues, with the highest level detected in the adductor muscle while the lowest in the hepatopancreas. The recombinant CgADO protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, was capable of converting cysteamine to hypotaurine. Overexpression of CgADO in HEK293T cells increased the production of taurine by 20.31-fold, compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. Inhibition of endogenous CgADO expression using RNA interference resulted in a 49% reduction in its mRNA expression and an 8% decline in taurine content in the adductor muscle of oysters. These results indicated that CgADO functioned as a cysteamine dioxygenase and played a certain role in taurine biosynthesis in C. gigas."

    "text": "Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, has shown therapeutic potential for treating inflammatory respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. However, the therapeutic efficacy of CBD is limited by extensive hepatic metabolism and low oral bioavailability (approximately 20 %). These problems can be overcome by choosing an appropriate targeted drug delivery system. Delivering CBD to the lungs via a dry powder formulation could be an effective method to achieve adequate concentration and therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases. The highest FPF of 62 % was achieved with a 20 % w/w LEC concentration and a feed concentration of 0.2 % w/v. Based on this, LEC plays a crucial role in enhancing aerosolization efficiency. While feed concentration negatively affects FPF, lower feed concentrations lead to an increase in FPF. The Fine Particle Dose (FPD) varied with the concentration of CBD, with higher concentrations resulting in a higher FPD. A 28 days stability study under different humidity conditions (<15 % and 53 %) confirmed the stability of the CBD formulations. INU and LEC exhibited minimal cytotoxicity on A549 cells, while the raw CBD and CBD formulations showed comparable levels of cytotoxicity, pIC"

This property renders them particularly suitable for the delivery of biologics - large, structurally complex, and often unstable therapeutic agents such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, vaccines, and live cells or microorganisms. MNs offer a painless, self-administrable, and user-friendly alternative to conventional parenteral routes that often require trained personnel, generate hazardous waste, and result in low patient compliance. Since their first description in the 1990s, a wide variety of MN systems have been developed including solid, hollow, coated, dissolving, and hydrogel-forming, each with distinct fabrication and formulation requirements. This review provides a detailed and comparative discussion on formulation strategies tailored for the efficient delivery of different classes of biologics using MNs, with emphasis on the physicochemical and biological interactions at the skin interface. Special attention is given to sterilization, an often-overlooked yet regulatory-critical aspect, highlighting its importance for product safety, bioburden control, and biologic stability. Both terminal sterilization methods and aseptic manufacturing approaches are reviewed along with emerging alternatives such as self-sterilizing MNs. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of biologic-loaded MNs currently undergoing clinical evaluation. While previous reviews have focused on materials or fabrication aspects, this article presents a formulation-centric analysis, integrating physicochemical considerations, delivery challenges, and clinical translation pathways. The goal is to provide formulation scientists and translational researchers with a practical guide to MN-enabled biologic delivery systems, from bench to bedside."

To investigate potential therapeutic interventions, this study focused on the effects of CYT997, a novel anti-cancer drug, on hypertrophic scar fibroblasts (HSFs). HS tissues were collected from patients and compared with normal skin samples. CYT997 decreased HSF viability in a concentration-dependent manner, with a selected concentration for further experiments. It selectively induced apoptosis in HSFs but not in normal fibroblasts, as shown by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. CYT997 also reduced HSF migration, contractility, and expression of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), indicating decreased fibrosis. In a rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model, CYT997 treatment inhibited scar formation, reduced the scar elevation index, and promoted apoptosis in HSFs. It also regulated apoptosis-related proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 in HSFs. These findings suggest that CYT997 has potential as a targeted therapy for hypertrophic scars by inducing apoptosis in HSFs and reducing fibrotic activity."

PA and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report scales. The WCS was calculated by subtracting self-reported average weekday sleep hours from weekend sleep hours, and serum hsCRP levels were measured using immunoturbidimetric methods. Given that depressive symptoms are characterized by their multifaceted nature, we identified specific symptoms associated with hsCRP levels. Path analysis was used to investigate the association between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and depressive symptoms, and that between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and specific symptoms related to hsCRP.\n\nRESULTS: Higher levels of PA and WCS were associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms through lowering hsCRP levels. Among various depressive symptoms, sleep problems and appetite changes were associated with hsCRP. In pathway analyses using them as dependent variables, higher levels of PA and WCS were also associated with a decreased risk of sleep problems and appetite changes through lowering hsCRP levels.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The current study employed a cross-sectional design, and WCS and PA were based on participants' self-reports rather than objective measurements.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of PA and WCS may help alleviate depressive symptoms, particularly sleep problems and appetite changes, by mitigating chronic inflammation. Therefore, ensuring adequate exercise time and compensating for inadequate weekday sleep during weekends are crucial for maintaining mental well-being."

In this study, LCA-loaded casein-pectin nanoparticles (LCA-CS-P) were prepared using a pH-driven method to improve the release mechanism, and oral bioavailability of LCA. The results showed that the particle size, ζ-potential, polymer dispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of LCA-CS-P were 228 ± 3.56 nm, -32.5 ± 0.62 mV, 0.23 ± 0.02, 88.6 ± 1.12 %, and 22.5 ± 0.92 % respectively. Gastrointestinal digestion dynamically modulates the hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions within nanoparticles. This pH-responsive interaction reconfiguration governs their gastric stability, intestinal release, and increased bioavailability (2.47-fold AUC increase vs. free LCA). In addition, LCA-CS-P not only significantly increased the content of LCA in various tissues, but also had gastric targeting. Therefore, LCA-CS-P nanoparticles are a viable strategy to improve the oral bioavailability of LCA and other active ingredients."

To address this, we first developed two lateral-flow immunoassays utilizing nanobodies specific to two BLCA biomarkers, NMP22 (Nuclear Matrix Protein-22) and survivin. The assays employ a sandwich-format design in which nanobodies replace traditional antibodies, providing high stability and low background interference. Clinical evaluation demonstrated that NMP22 detection achieved 81.8 % sensitivity and 90.9 % specificity, while survivin detection yielded 72.7 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Both assays showed no significant differences compared to commercial ELISA kits (p > 0.05). Notably, multiplex detection using both strips achieved 100.0 % sensitivity and 90.9 % specificity, demonstrating superior performance compared to single-biomarker approaches. The strips are simple to prepare and cost-effective, offering a new method for the rapid screening and early diagnosis of BLCA."

    "text": "PEGylation, the covalent attachment of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) to biomolecules, is a well-established molecular modification strategy that enhances the pharmacological properties of conjugated proteins by improving stability, reducing immunogenicity, extending half-life, and increasing solubility. Despite its benefits, PEGylated proteins are often heterogeneous mixtures containing positional isoforms that are challenging to eliminate and can significantly impact the biological activity of drugs. This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes. As a result, it offers improved robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed RP-UPLC method exhibited outstanding repeatability across various storage conditions, making it a reliable tool for quality control and product release in the biopharmaceutical industry."

This study aimed to the cardioprotective effect of sT-cad.\n\nMETHODS & RESULTS: The sT-cad-expressing plasmid was administered to 7-week-old wild-type mice. One week after administration, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery was performed to induce pressure-overload heart failure. Then, the mice were sacrificed at 2 weeks after the surgery. In the mice that received sT-cad, the TAC-induced increase in heart weight and decline in cardiac function were significantly attenuated. Based on the cardiac histological analysis, sT-cad suppressed both cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac RNA sequencing analysis showed that sT-cad inhibited the TAC-induced upregulation of fibrosis-related genes. In addition, in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, sT-cad supplementation suppressed the TGF-β-induced mRNA expression of Acta2, a myofibroblast marker.\n\nCONCLUSION: sT-cad ameliorated the pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice."

One of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for IPF, oral pirfenidone (PFD), has limited clinical applications owing to its systemic side effects. In contrast to oral administration, inhaled therapy offers enhanced therapeutic efficacy at the target organ while minimizing systemic side effects. However, its application has challenges, such as limited drug delivery to the distal lung region and rapid clearance. In this study, we developed pulmonary surfactant (PS)-based PFD-loaded nanovesicles (PFD-PSNVs) for targeted delivery to the lung area and prolonged retention and examined their safety, stability, and antifibrotic efficacy. PFD-PSNVs were prepared using the thin-film hydration and extrusion method. The mean size and zeta potential of PFD-PSNVs were 149.7 ± 10.1 nm and - 31.3 ± 2.3 mV, respectively. An in vitro antifibrotic study showed that PFD-PSNVs inhibited the expression of fibrotic factors such as p-ERK, p-SMAD2/3, and α-SMA proteins on fibroblasts activated by transforming growth factor-β1. When inhaled in mice using a nebulizer, the PFD-PSNVs remained in lung tissues for 24 h, whereas Arikayce, an FDA-approved liposomal formulation for inhalation, was eliminated within 6 h. In a bleomycin sulfate-induced IPF mouse model, inhalation treatment with PFD-PSNVs significantly reduced collagen deposition (76.2 ± 4.1 %, p < 0.01) and α-SMA expression (60.8 ± 3.7 %, p < 0.05) compared with inhalation treatment with the PFD-loaded CtrlNV (PFD-CNVs) formulation and oral administration of PFD. These results indicate that PSNVs have great potential as an inhaled drug delivery system for the treatment of IPF."

Early detection and targeted therapy depend on identifying key molecular biomarkers that drive tumor progression. The molecular heterogeneity of COAD demands robust computational strategies to improve the accuracy of biomarker discovery.\n\nMETHODS: We developed and implemented a comprehensive, multi-step bioinformatics and statistical pipeline to systematically prioritize clinically relevant biomarkers in COAD. This pipeline integrated differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis to identify key hub genes associated with tumor progression. We subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) and overall survival modeling to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these candidates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Finally, experimental validation of the prioritized hub genes was conducted via qPCR across three CRC cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29), confirming their upregulation and supporting their clinical potential.\n\nRESULTS: Our integrative pipeline prioritized five key hub genes (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) as significantly upregulated in COAD tissues compared to normal controls. Functional enrichment analysis linked these genes to extracellular matrix degradation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory signaling, and tumor invasion, underscoring their roles in key oncogenic processes. Survival analysis revealed varying degrees of association with patient prognosis, most notably for CXCL1. Diagnostic performance, assessed by ROC analysis, yielded moderate AUC values (0.669-0.692), supporting their potential as biomarkers. Finally, qPCR validation across three CRC cell lines confirmed robust upregulation of all five genes, reinforcing their biological relevance in COAD progression.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study establishes a reproducible, integrative bioinformatics and statistical framework for the systematic identification of clinically actionable biomarkers in CRC. The five hub genes prioritized (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) demonstrated consistent diagnostic and prognostic value, offering a solid basis for the development of non-invasive molecular diagnostics and contributing to precision oncology."

The nutrient adequacy ratio and mean adequacy ratio were applied to estimate the adequacy of micronutrients. Standing height was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm, and weight of the women was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a battery-powered digital scale (Seca Gmbh & Co. KG, Germany). A linear regression model was fitted to determine the relationship between nutritional status and khat chewing. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds of nutrient intake inadequacy among the two study groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% CI.\n\nRESULTS: Women who chewed khat had a higher prevalence of underweight (36.6%) than those who did not (9.4%). The mean (SD) body mass index for khat chewer women was 48.66±5.39 kg, while that of non-chewer women was 55.29±6.75 kg.

    "text": "BACKGROUND: The Government of Indonesia and UNICEF introduced the Aksi Bergizi Social Behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) intervention to promote healthy dietary behaviors among adolescents. However, no systematic assessment of the Program's effect has been made. The objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the extent to which exposure to the Aksi Bergizi Program is associated with dietary behaviors among secondary school students, and; 2) to assess mediation of the mentioned association by dietary self-efficacy.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a school-based cross-sectional study in Padang Municipality, Indonesia. We collected data from 253 students attending Aksi Bergizi target schools, and 253 students from non-target schools, using self-administered questionnaire with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) section. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics with analysis of mediation by self-efficacy in dietary consumption.\n\nRESULTS: We identified three distinct dietary patterns among the students: one characterized by higher frequencies of eating meat, processed foods, and dessert (i.e., \"High Protein and Processed Foods\" dietary pattern), another by higher frequencies of eating snacks and sweetened drinks (\"Snacks and Sugary Drinks\"), and another by higher frequencies of eating soybean products and fresh fruits and lower frequency of eating preserved vegetables (\"Healthier Diet\"). Students in the Aksi Bergizi target schools were significantly less likely than students in the non-target schools to have the High Protein and Processed Foods dietary pattern (40.2% vs. 53.9%, Adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.99) and more likely to have a Healthier Diet pattern, although the difference of the latter was not statistically significant. Students in the target schools, however, were also more likely than students in the non-target schools to have the Snacks and Sugary Drinks dietary pattern (78.7% vs. 40.4%, Adjusted OR = 6.22; 95% CI = 2.68, 14.42). Regarding mediation, students in the Aksi Bergizi target schools had significantly different dietary self-efficacy from students in the non-target schools (p < 0.001). However, self-efficacy was not significantly associated with dietary habits. The association in the non-mediated pathway between exposure to the Aksi Bergizi program and dietary habits was statistically significant (p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study have implications for stakeholders in adolescent health. However, limitations regarding the cross-sectional design (which precludes the ability to make causal inference), social desirability, and limited generalizability should be considered in the interpretation of the study findings."

To address this, an integrated urinary metabolomics and peptidomics analysis was conducted comparing HN patients to hypertensive (HTN) controls, aiming to identify molecular signatures indicative of disease progression and clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms driving HN development. Urine samples were analyzed from both discovery (51 HTN vs 51 HN patients, including 27 early stage and 24 advanced-stage) and validation (21 HTN vs 21 HN) cohorts. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 40 differential metabolites across various stages: hypertension, early stage HN, and advanced-stage HN. These metabolites were associated with metabolic pathways including amino acid, carbohydrate, short-chain fatty acid, and nucleotide metabolism, such as cysteine and methionine, tyrosine, and nicotinate metabolism. Moreover, 10 differential urinary peptides were linked to coagulation regulation, immune processes, and plasminogen activation. Combining 43 clinical-correlated molecules, a high-performance diagnostic model was developed, demonstrating remarkable discrimination: AUCs of 0.973 (HTN vs early-HN), 0.998 (HTN vs advanced-HN), and 0.941 (early vs advanced-HN) in the discovery cohort, which were maintained at 0.847-0.970 in validation. Advanced-HN detection achieved exceptional accuracy (90.5%), specificity (95.2%), precision (94.7%), and an F1-score of 0.900.

We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationships between insulin use and PND. The forward MR analysis revealed that insulin use considerably reduced the risk of delirium (odds ratio [OR] = 0.01, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.0007-0.22, P = 0.003) and enhanced cognitive performance (OR = 8.03, 95 % CI: 2.83-22.78, P = 0.001). Importantly, the reverse MR analysis indicated that cognitive impairment or delirium did not causally affect insulin use (OR ≈ 1.0, P > 0.5). Utilizing GEO datasets, we identified 63 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both postoperative delirium and insulin treatment. Subsequent analyses, including the construction of a protein-protein interaction network and Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, identified EPN2, DNAJC6, ARFGAP1, and HIP1R as key hub genes that could serve as potential therapeutic targets for PND. Further research showed that these hub genes are part of a multi-pathway interactive network, which may significantly contribute to the onset and progression of PND, with insulin also affecting their regulation. Our results establish a unidirectional genetic causality for the therapeutic effects of insulin in PND and reveal new molecular targets, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind insulin treatment for PND."

Moreover, an in vivo atherosclerosis model was established by tail vein injection of AAV8-PCSK9 virus into mice who were then fed a high-fat diet. EGR3 expression was manipulated through cellular lentiviral transfection and conditional gene knockout in mice. Oil red O staining was used to assess lipid droplet and mouse aortic plaque formation. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in mouse aortic tissue. To quantify C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ELISA was conducted on HCAEC lysates and mouse serum samples. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine EGR3 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) protein levels and in both cellular lysates and mouse aortic tissue.\n\nRESULTS: In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that EGR3 expression was elevated in the ox-LDL group. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the CRP and VCAM-1 expression levels were significantly reduced and that lipid droplet formation was inhibited by EGR3 inhibition. Consistently, CRP, VCAM-1, blood glucose and lipid levels, and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in mice were significantly reduced in Egr3 knockout mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that atherosclerosis development appears to be associated with the regulation of CRP and VCAM expression by EGR3. These results suggest that targeting EGR3 may be a promising approach for treating atherosclerosis."

This makes biotin an attractive ligand for tumor-targeted drug delivery. Building on this rationale, this study presents a series of six D-(+)-biotin-conjugated squaraine dyes derived from benzothiazole, indolenine, and benz[e]indole, with N-ethyl and N-hexyl chains. These compounds were thoroughly characterized in terms of their photophysical and photochemical properties, revealing strong absorption in the so-called \"phototherapeutic window\", notable fluorescence, especially the benzothiazole derivatives, aqueous stability, particularly the indolenine-based dyes, and moderate to high photostability. Computational studies further indicated a strong binding affinity to human serum albumin and avidin proteins. All dyes exhibited photodynamic activity, with indolenine derivatives showing remarkable tumor selectivity and benz[e]indole analogs evidencing superior photocytotoxicity. The most promising compounds preferentially accumulated in mitochondria, and both singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species were found to play a role in their photobiological effects. Additionally, they were non-genotoxic in the absence of irradiation, and apoptosis was the primary mechanism of cell death upon light activation. This was evidenced by preserved cytoplasmic membrane integrity, nuclear fragmentation, and caspase-3/7 activation, reinforcing the safety and potential of these compounds as phototherapeutic agents. Although cellular uptake via the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter was not established, and diffusion is expected to be the predominant mechanism, the high predicted avidin-binding affinity of these dyes opens exciting new avenues for photodynamic therapy-combined strategies."

However, there is limited information regarding the efficacy and safety of sacubitril-valsartan (SV) in MHD patients suffering from hypertension. Consequently, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SV in this specific patient population.\n\nMETHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the data of MHD patients with hypertension who were receiving SV treatment at our hospital from January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024. The SV dose ranged from 50 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily. Blood pressure measurements were compared at baseline and during follow-up intervals to assess therapeutic efficacy. Safety evaluations included comprehensive monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events throughout the observation period.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 64 MHD patients hypertension (mean age = 54.11 years; male proportion = 73.4%) were ultimately included in the study. After three months of treatment with SV, the mean reductions in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were 21.06 ± 15.82 mmHg (P < 0.001), 8.41 ± 13.09 mmHg (P < 0.001), and 12.65 ± 13.17 mmHg (P < 0.001), respectively. With respect to safety, new-onset intradialytic hypotension was observed in three patients. The study also included twelve patients with hyperkalemia. Importantly, no patients reported experiencing cough, angioedema, or abnormal liver biochemistry. Among the 64 subjects, none required a dose reduction or discontinuation of SV due to these adverse effects.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In MHD patients with hypertension, SV demonstrates a preliminary ability to lower blood pressure and appears safe. Further prospective randomized studies are warranted to validate our findings."

Because of their ability to interrogate large numbers of variants, multiplexed assays of variant effect and computational tools are viewed as a critical part of the solution to variant classification uncertainty. However, the (joint) performance of these assays and tools on novel variants has not been established. Transformation of the qualitative classification guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) into a quantitative Bayesian point system enables empirical validation of strength of evidence assigned to evidence criteria. Here, we derived a maximum-likelihood estimate model that converts frequentist odds ratios calculated from case-control data to proportions pathogenic and applied this model to functional assays, alone and in combination with computational tools across several domains of BRCA1. Furthermore, we defined exceptionally conserved ancestral residues (ECARs) and interrogated the performance of assays and tools at these residues in BRCA1. We found that missense substitutions in BRCA1 that fall at ECARs are disproportionately likely to be pathogenic with effect sizes similar to that of protein-truncating variants. In contrast, for substitutions falling at non-ECAR positions, concordant predictions of pathogenicity from functional assays and computational tools often fail to meet the additive assumptions of strength in ACMG guidelines. Thus, collectively, we conclude that strengths of evidence assigned by expert opinion in the ACMG guidelines are not universally applicable and require empirical validation."

Methods: data was collected from the 2007-2018 Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Weighted binary logistic regression was adopted to investigate the association between sedentary behavior and CKD risk. Weighted binary logistic regression and restricted cubic spline were performed to evaluate the correlation between dietary plant protein and CKD risk in sedentary individuals. Results: participants with higher sedentary behavior (≥ 6 h/day) had a 1.13 times higher risk of developing CKD than those with lower sedentary behavior (< 6 h/day). In participants with higher sedentary behavior, intake of a higher plant protein ratio was associated with reduced CKD risk. In a continuous model, after adjusting for all covariates, each 10 % increase in plant protein ratio decreased CKD risk by 35.4 % (odds ratio (OR), 0.646; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.465-0.899).

Methods: a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted, including all adult and pediatric patients receiving HEN in April 2023. Data on demographic, clinical, nutritional, and HEN characteristics were collected. Nutritional regimens, access methods, infusion modalities, and complications were analysed. Statistical analysis included descriptive and comparative tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: among 1,816 patients (1,269 adults, 547 children), neurological conditions were the leading indication for HEN (adults: 77.9 %, paediatric: 67.8 %), followed by oncological conditions (adults: 11.7 %, paediatric: 1.3 %). Gastrostomy was the predominant access method, and non-continuous infusion was most common (cyclic in adults, intermittent in paediatric). Complication rates related to nutrition access were low (adults: 2.3 %, paediatric: 2.9 %), with tube dislodgement and ostomy leakage as the most frequent issues. Nutritional formulas were prescribed based on caloric and protein needs, with no significant differences in complication rates between formula types. Conclusion: this first Latin American study on HEN highlights the predominance of neurological conditions, the preference for gastrostomy access, and non-continuous feeding. The low complication rates suggest the safety of HEN, underscoring the need for standardized data collection and regulation to optimize care and outcomes in Argentina."

Recent advancements in gene sequencing technologies have led to the identification of numerous genes associated with heart failure. By utilizing available gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we conducted a screening for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to heart failure. Key genes were identified through intersection analysis in conjunction with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Following this, we pinpointed four essential genes (ITIH5, ISLR, ASPN, and FNDC1) by employing functional enrichment analyses, machine learning approaches, protein-protein interaction (PPI) assessments, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration evaluations. Additionally, a novel diagnostic model for heart failure was successfully developed using a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN), and its diagnostic performance was validated within public datasets. Analysis via single-cell RNA sequencing further indicated stable up-regulation patterns of these genes across various cardiomyocyte types in HF patients. Moreover, the exploration of drug-protein interactions revealed two potential therapeutic drugs targeting the identified key genes, with molecular docking offering a feasible pathway for this connection. In conclusion, we identified four potential key biomarkers closely related to HF and two possibly effective small molecules, which provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying heart failure and the search for new therapeutic targets."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis remains a challenge, particularly in low-resource settings. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has shown promise, but most studies focus on HIV-infected populations. In the case of TB, data on lung ultrasound (LUS) are sparse. Therefore, this study evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of lung and abdominal ultrasound for TB diagnosis in an Indian tertiary care hospital.\n\nMETHODS: We prospectively enrolled adults with presumed TB and performed comprehensive ultrasound assessments. Accuracy of individual and combined sonographic findings was evaluated against a robust reference standard (mycobacterial culture and PCR). Comparators were C-reactive protein at a cut-off of 5mg/l and chest x-ray (CXR). A multivariable model incorporating clinical and ultrasound findings was explored using generalized mixed models and a random forest approach. (Trial registry DRKS00026636).\n\nFINDINGS: Among 541 participants, 102 (19%) were diagnosed with TB and 1% were HIV-positive. The \"Focused Assessment with Sonography for HIV-associated TB\" (FASH) demonstrated moderate sensitivity (51%) and specificity (70%). Consolidations <1 cm on LUS showed high sensitivity (93%) but low specificity (16%) and were also seen in non-TB lung infections and other conditions like bronchial asthma and COPD. Accuracy of larger (≥1 cm) consolidations (72% sensitive, 55% specific) on LUS was comparable with CXR suggesting possible TB (81% sensitive, 58% specific). Predictive modeling suggests moderate diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.79).\n\nINTERPRETATION: In our study, POCUS did not meet WHO targets for a stand-alone facility-based screening test. Nevertheless, diagnostic accuracy for some findings is comparable to CXR and could be integrated into diagnostic algorithms to improve TB screening where CXR cannot reach. Future research should explore artificial intelligence to enhance TB-POCUS accuracy and accessibility, as was previously reported for CXR.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Prior to this study, lung ultrasound (LUS) for TB had been assessed in only a few studies, limited by uncertain sonographic characterization of TB-related findings, lack of consistent terminology, and small numbers of participants with confirmed non-TB diagnoses to determine specificity for TB. Studies evaluating Focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated tuberculosis (FASH) almost exclusively included HIV-infected individuals and demonstrated moderate sensitivity and specificity. However, varying study designs and reference standards limit broader generalization of their findings. Our prospective study from a TB-endemic setting (India) recruited 541 predominantly HIV-negative participants with presumed TB. This is the largest cohort to date assessing LUS, FASH, and additional ultrasound findings for TB diagnosis. Our study demonstrates that no single ultrasound finding alone, or even in combination, reaches the accuracy targets of the target product profile for a facility-based screening test (triage) proposed by WHO. FASH accuracy in our study aligned with previously reported data in HIV-negative participants but was less specific in HIV-positive participants. The accuracy of additional ultrasound items of LUS and FASH was comparable to chest x-ray (CXR). In summary, this study demonstrates accuracy of ultrasound for TB diagnosis, backed by a robust study design and using a comprehensive reference standard and CXR comparator for LUS. Modelling suggests that an algorithmic approach combining ultrasound and clinical findings may be of highest value to inform risk of TB and guide further testing to confirm the diagnosis of TB. Other use cases of POCUS, which may aid clinical decision making in the assessment of disease severity, sampling strategy, and monitoring, should be evaluated by future studies. These should also focus on the accuracy of POCUS in people living with HIV and children, as well as evaluate POCUS more broadly as part of a diagnostic algorithm and by using artificial intelligence to improve the yield of TB-POCUS."

Two datasets (GSE5010 and GSE50223) were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database, containing 38 and 84 blood CD4 + T cell samples, respectively. To eliminate batch effects, the surrogate variable analysis (sva) R package (version 3.38.0) was employed, enabling the integration of data for subsequent analysis. Immune cell infiltration profiles were assessed using the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) R package (version 1.36.3). A gene co-expression network was constructed via the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm to identify disease-related modules. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the linear models for microarray data (limma) R package (version 3.34.7), followed by functional enrichment analysis using DAVID. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed based on the STRING database to highlight key genes. A diagnostic model was subsequently developed utilizing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, with its discriminative capacity assessed via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. A total of twenty-eight immune cell types were analyzed, revealing significant differences in eight types between the AR and control groups. Through WGCNA, three disease-related modules comprising 4278 candidate genes were identified. Differential expression analysis identified 326 significant DEGs, of which 257 overlapped with WGCNA-selected genes. These genes exhibited significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, including \"cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\" and \"chemokine signaling pathway.\" Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further uncovered 12 KEGG pathways significantly associated with disease risk scores. Drug screening identified 24 small molecule drugs related to key genes. A diagnostic model incorporating five genes (RFC4, LYN, IL3, TNFRSF1B, and RBBP7) was constructed, demonstrating diagnostic efficiencies of 0.843 and 0.739 in the training and validation sets, respectively. An AR mouse model was successfully established, and the expression levels of relevant genes were validated through RT-qPCR experiments. The five-gene diagnostic model established in this study exhibits strong predictive ability in distinguishing AR patients from healthy controls, with potential clinical applications in diagnosing AR and advancing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

However, most of the published clinical studies on Ayurveda interventions for osteoarthritis management have addressed selected modalities of Ayurveda treatment rather than the holistic therapeutic regimen.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a multimodal Ayurveda treatment protocol in the long-term management of primary osteoarthritis of the knee compared with standard care.\n\nMETHODS: The proposed open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in individuals of any gender aged 40 to 70 years and diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the knee as per the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Individuals with grade 4 radiographic changes in the affected knee (based on the Kellgren-Lawrence classification) and with comorbidities were not considered. The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. A total of 150 participants underwent random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the Ayurveda treatment protocol or conventional standard care for 180 days. The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score from baseline. The secondary outcome measures included the change in the score for pain, stiffness, and physical function from baseline; change in the range of motion of the knee joint; change in the score of the numeric pain rating scale, Pain Disability Index, and 12-item short-form survey questionnaire (to assess health-related quality of life); change in highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels, interleukin-6 levels, magnetic resonance imaging scan findings, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan findings; and change in the need for rescue analgesic medication from baseline. Safety was evaluated by recording the incidence of adverse events and changes in liver and kidney function tests from baseline.\n\nRESULTS: Recruitment of study participants commenced on October 11, 2022. Currently, all the participants completed the study and the analysis of the study outcomes is ongoing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial will be the first study to explore the potential benefits of a multimodal Ayurveda regimen (based on Ayurveda principles and scientific evidence) in the long-term management of osteoarthritis of the knee through validated subjective, laboratory, and imaging parameters. The outcomes of this study may address the needs and challenges associated with osteoarthritis management.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2022/05/042792; https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?EncHid=Njk0MTM=&Enc=&userName=.\n\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/68306."

    "text": "The circadian rhythm is a key biological mechanism that aligns organisms' physiological processes with Earth's 24-h light-dark cycle, crucial for cellular and tissue homeostasis. Disruption of this system is linked to accelerated aging and age-related diseases. Central to circadian regulation is the CLOCK protein, which controls gene transcription related to tissue homeostasis, cellular senescence, and DNA repair. Research reveals CLOCK's dual role: in normal cells, it supports rejuvenation by activating DNA repair factors like XPA and modulating metabolism; in tumor cells, CLOCK signaling is often hijacked by oncogenic drivers like c-MYC and Pdia3, which inhibit telomere shortening / cellular senescence, thereby fostering uncontrolled proliferation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, gut microbiota-derived aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signals can disrupt the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex, affecting circadian rhythms. CLOCK also interacts with mTOR and NF-κB pathways to regulate autophagy and mitigate harmful secretions impacting tissue function. This review examines the molecular links between CLOCK and cellular senescence, drawing from animal and human studies, to highlight CLOCK's role in aging and its potential as a target for anti-aging therapies."

This study aims to systematically characterize the epidemiological profile of voriconazole-induced liver injury and identify modifiable independent risk factors. We analyzed 7,659 voriconazole-treated adults (2007-2020) from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University to determine incidence and injury subtypes.

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) several factors, such as inflammation and hypoxemia, stimulate or inhibit Hep production. Our aims were to assess the isoform concentrations in COPD, explore the associations between the isoforms and pathophysiological variables, and assess the effect of initiation of long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) on Hep concentrations.\n\nMETHODS: The study population constituted 84 patients with COPD and 59 non-COPD participants. Hep isoforms, parameters of inflammation and iron status, and partial pressures of arterial oxygen (pO2) were measured at baseline and at 6-months follow-up in COPD patients. Associations between isoforms and clinical and biochemical characteristics were examined by multivariable tobit regression, while tobit regression with random effects was used to assess whether initiation of LTOT influenced the isoforms.\n\nRESULTS: At least one isoform was detected in 96% of the participants, of which Hep25 was the most and Hep22 the least common. All isoforms were associated with C-reactive protein and ferritin. Hep25 and Hep24 were also associated with transferrin saturation, and Hep24 was associated with urine albumin-creatinine ratio. None of the isoforms were associated with hemoglobin, pO2, smoking, or COPD. There was a significant reduction of Hep25 and Hep24 from baseline to follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: All isoforms were associated with inflammation, while Hep25 and Hep24 were associated with circulating iron and Hep24 with kidney disease. The concentrations of Hep isoforms were not associated with COPD, nor did initiation of LTOT result in significant changes of isoform concentrations."

Herein, we report the rational chemical design and synthesis of a dithiolane-incorporated lipidoid (S-DOPE) to construct an innovative LNP formulation, termed SLNP, for enhanced intracellular mRNA delivery. These chemically engineered SLNPs exploit an inherent thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, whereby the unique dithiolane moiety triggers a dynamic covalent disulfide-thiol exchange reaction with cell surface thiols. This chemically driven reaction facilitates direct cytosolic mRNA delivery, effectively bypassing endosomal entrapment, a major bottleneck for conventional LNPs. In vitro studies demonstrate that SLNP formulations achieve an 11-fold increase in mRNA transfection and translation efficiency compared to standard LNPs. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations reveal a 4.5-fold enhancement in mRNA expression and robust immune responses. SLNP-mediated vaccination at low doses elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response. Notably, SLNPs induce neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are comparable to those achieved with significantly higher doses of conventional LNPs, highlighting their substantial dose-sparing potential. These findings establish that SLNP, by leveraging the chemically innovative thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, offers a promising and chemically distinct strategy to enhance both the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines, which is particularly valuable in scenarios of limited vaccine supply and for minimizing potential adverse effects associated with high vaccine dosages."

    "text": "Sleep fragmentation is common in older adults and is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as key histopathological correlates of dementia, including small vessel disease and cerebral infarcts. Vascular and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are thought to contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes, a key vascular cell type, may play a key role. In model organisms, sleep disruption is associated with pericyte dysfunction and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Recent advances in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) technology have identified two transcriptionally distinct subtypes of pericytes: extracellular matrix protein-expressing M-pericytes and solute carrier-expressing T-pericytes. However, the relationship between sleep, pericyte biology and cognition in humans remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that differences in the composition of brain pericyte subpopulations, as inferred from marker gene expression, may link sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline. We leveraged two published human brain snRNAseq datasets to identify specific marker genes for M- and T-type pericytes. We then used post-mortem bulk RNAseq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 1092) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (n = 495) to quantify expression of these marker genes in older adults in two longitudinal cohort studies: the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. We derived trajectories of global cognitive function from participants' ante-mortem annual cognitive assessments, while sleep fragmentation was derived from ante-mortem wrist-actigraphy recordings from a subset of 572 participants. We used multivariate linear regression to relate pericyte marker gene expression to sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline in the decade preceding death. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, greater average sleep fragmentation was associated with greater expression of M-pericyte marker genes [estimate = +3.65 × 10-1, standard error (SE) = 1.61 × 10-1, P = 0.024] but not T-pericyte marker genes. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression of M-pericyte (estimate = -8.30 × 10-3, SE = 3.37 × 10-3, P = 0.014) but not T-pericyte marker genes was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in the 10 years prior to death. In the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, greater sleep fragmentation was also associated with greater composite M-pericyte gene expression (estimate = + 4.48 × 10-1, SE = 1.92 × 10-1, P = 0.02), which in turn was associated with faster cognitive decline in the decade preceding death (estimate = -1.30 × 10-2, SE = 4.55 × 10-3, P = 0.0044). These findings identify a potential role of M-pericytes in linking sleep fragmentation and cognitive trajectories in older adults. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of vascular mechanisms in linking disrupted sleep to dementia."

CMT2 clinical symptoms include distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, toe and foot deformities, with some patients presenting with reduced nerve conduction velocity. Mutations in the neurofilament light chain (NEFL) gene result in a specific form of CMT2 disease, CMT2E. NEFL encodes the protein, NF-L, one of the core intermediate filament proteins that contribute to the maintenance and stability of the axonal cytoskeleton. To better understand the underlying biology of CMT2E disease and advance the development of therapeutics, we generated a Nefl+/E397K mouse model. While the Nefl+/E397K mutation is inherited in a dominant manner, we also characterized NeflE397K/E397K mice to determine whether disease onset, progression or severity would be impacted. Consistent with CMT2E, lifespan was not altered in these novel mouse models. A longitudinal electrophysiology study demonstrated significant in vivo functional abnormalities as early as P21 in distal latency, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and negative area. A significant reduction in the sciatic nerve axon area, diameter, and G-ratio was also present as early as P21. Through the twelve months measured, disease became more evident in all assessments. Collectively, these results demonstrate an early and robust in vivo electrophysiological phenotype and axonal pathology, making Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice ideal for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches."

Recent preclinical evidence suggests that both modifications play a significant role in multiple disorders, including infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancer, sparking great interest in their therapeutic potential. Structural characterization of ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) and key m6A enzymes has enabled the development of small molecule inhibitors modulating their expression, enzymatic activity, or binding to target RNAs. Herein, we review preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic benefits of targeting ADARs and m6A enzymes in diverse disease contexts. Small molecule inhibitors of RNA modification enzymes have shown potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells, and have successfully inhibited tumor growth in vivo, without evident toxicity, while their combination with immuno-/chemotherapeutics displayed synergistic anti-neoplastic action. Adenosine RNA editing via recruitment of endogenous ADARs and usage of guide RNAs showed remarkable efficacy in correcting G-to-A point mutations and restoring the associated protein expression with limited off-target activity.

Recent findings demonstrated significant molecular similarities between PM-Mito and inclusion body myositis (IBM), suggesting a trajectory from early to late IBM and prompting the inclusion of PM-Mito as an IBM precursor (early IBM) within the IBM spectrum. Both PM-Mito and IBM show mitochondrial abnormalities, suggesting that mitochondrial disturbance is a crucial element of IBM pathogenesis. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to characterize the mitochondrial phenotype in PM-Mito at histological, ultrastructural and molecular levels and to study the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Skeletal muscle biopsies of 27 patients with PM-Mito and 27 with typical IBM were included for morphological and ultrastructural analysis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and deletions were assessed by quantitative PCR and long-range PCR, respectively. In addition, full-length single-molecule sequencing of the mtDNA enabled precise mapping of deletions. Protein and RNA levels were studied using unbiased proteomic profiling, immunoblotting and bulk RNA sequencing. Cell-free mtDNA was measured in the serum of IBM patients. We found widespread mitochondrial abnormalities in both PM-Mito and IBM, illustrated by elevated numbers of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-negative and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive fibres and prominent ultrastructural abnormalities, with disorganized and concentric cristae within enlarged and dysmorphic mitochondria. mtDNA copy numbers were significantly reduced, and multiple large-scale mtDNA deletions were already evident in PM-Mito compared with healthy age-matched controls, similar to the IBM group. The canonical cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes inflammatory pathway was activated in PM-Mito and IBM, and we detected elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA indicative of mtDNA leakage. In PM-Mito and IBM, these findings were accompanied by dysregulation of proteins and transcripts linked to the mitochondrial membranes. In summary, we identified that mitochondrial dysfunction with multiple mtDNA deletions and depletion, disturbed mitochondrial ultrastructure and defects of the inner mitochondrial membrane are features of PM-Mito and IBM, underlining the concept of an IBM-spectrum disease. Notably, mitochondrial abnormalities precede tissue remodelling and infiltration by specific T-cell subpopulations (e.g. KLRG1+) characteristic of late IBM. The activation of inflammatory, DNA-sensing pathways might be related to mtDNA release, which would indicate a significant role of mitochondria-associated inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBM-spectrum disease. This study highlights the crucial role of early mitochondrial abnormalities in the pathomechanism of IBM, which might lead to new approaches to therapy."

Despite clinical and muscle pathology features highly suggestive of collagen VI-related dystrophy, some patients had remained without an identified causative variant in COL6A1, COL6A2 or COL6A3. With combined muscle RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we uncovered a recurrent, de novo deep intronic variant in intron 11 of COL6A1 (c.930+189C>T) that leads to a dominantly acting in-frame pseudoexon insertion. We subsequently identified and have characterized an international cohort of 44 patients with this COL6A1 intron 11 causative variant, one of the most common recurrent causative variants in the collagen VI genes. Patients manifest a consistently severe phenotype characterized by a paucity of early symptoms followed by an accelerated progression to a severe form of UCMD, except for one patient with somatic mosaicism for this COL6A1 intron 11 variant who manifests a milder phenotype consistent with Bethlem muscular dystrophy. Partial amelioration of the disease phenotype in this individual provides a strong rationale for the development of our pseudoexon skipping therapy to successfully suppress the pseudoexon insertion, resulting in normal COL6A1 transcripts. We have previously shown that splice-modulating antisense oligomers applied in vitro effectively decreased the abundance of the mutant pseudoexon-containing COL6A1 transcripts to levels comparable to the in vivo scenario of the somatic mosaicism shown here, indicating that this therapeutic approach carries significant translational promise for ameliorating the severe form of UCMD caused by this common recurrent COL6A1 variant."

Investigator assessment and safety monitoring were also conducted.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the study. Wound size reduced significantly across all groups, with an average reduction of 54%, and 41% of patients achieving complete healing. Symptom severity, as measured by TSS, showed a consistent and significant reduction. Clinical improvement was observed in 95% of patients and no serious adverse events were reported. The product demonstrated good safety and tolerability.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, the HA and amino acids product effectively reduced ulcer size, improved symptoms and promoted healing, demonstrating its efficacy in hard-to-heal wound management. The findings are clinically significant but limited by the absence of a control group and a short observation period. Further randomised controlled trials are required to confirm these results and explore broader clinical applications."

    "text": "PURPOSE: To develop an in vitro model that mimics aspects of corneal healing in humans for uncovering key mechanisms involved in the mechanisms involved in the healing and scarring processes.\n\nMETHODS: As part of the healing matrix, TGF-β1-induced and corneal-derived myofibroblasts were cultured in fibrin hydrogels with configurations that recapitulate the healthy (aligned) and wounded (random) microenvironment of the cornea.\n\nRESULTS: Evaluation of cellular alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) showed cell and matrix alignment, respectively. The aligned compared to the random constructs demonstrated an increased ability to synthesize total soluble proteins, including collagen type V, but collagen type I levels were reduced. This finding reveals a differential pattern for these proteins. Additionally, the collagen fibril diameters were larger in the aligned tissue constructs compared to the random constructs. Fibronectin and CHP colocalization patterns did not differ between groups; however, fibronectin and decorin were increased in the aligned group in contrast to tenascin C, which showed no difference.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the alignment of the healing microenvironment plays a crucial role in modulating the structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulates the synthesis of key proteins that are closely involved in fibrillogenesis and are indicative of the quality of the deposited ECM.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We developed a three-dimensional in vitro model that closely mimics in vivo conditions to investigate the role of corneal myofibroblasts in healing and regeneration. Ultimately, this model can help develop targeted antifibrotic therapies to prevent corneal scarring."

Disordered lipid metabolism inundates endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages with triglyceriderich lipoproteins, oxidized LDL and saturated fatty acids, expanding the intracellular palmitoylCoA pool and perturbing redox balance. Protein Spalmitoylation, the reversible attachment of palmitate to cysteine residues, converts excess palmitoylCoA into broad alterations in signalling and membrane dynamics. The FASN-ACSL-ZDHHC axis channel excess fatty acids into palmitoylCoA, which is transferred to pivotal proteins including the lipid transporter CD36, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), key ion channels and the pyroptosis effector gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cycles of palmitate addition and removal regulate membrane residency, foam cell formation, nitric oxide production, calcium handling and inflammatory cell death, thereby linking lipid burden to atherosclerotic plaque growth, arrhythmogenic risk, heart failure progression and pulmonary hypertension. Therapeutic targeting of fatty acid uptake, palmitoyltransferases or thioesterases alleviates metabolic overload, restores endothelial reactivity and preserves myocardial viability in experimental models. This review synthesizes mechanistic and preclinical studies to delineate how lipiddriven protein palmitoylation reprograms cardiovascular physiology and pathology."

Dysbiosis in the structure of the gut microbiota resulting in increased abundance of harmful bacteria and decreased beneficial bacteria has been frequently associated with CRC development. Recently, probiotics and their derivatives have received great attention as anticancer agents for prevention and treatment of various cancers. This study aimed to assess the potential effects of probiotic Bacillus coagulans Hammer and its derivatives on induction of apoptosis in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro.\n\nMETHODS: Cell viability of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells was examined by MTT assay after exposure to varying concentrations of pasteurized and UV-killed B. coagulans Hammer, its extracellular vesicles (EVs), and cell-free supernatant (CFS). The apoptotic effects of different B. coagulans Hammer derivatives on HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were determined by analyzing the expression level of apoptosis-related genes (Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, Caspase-9) using RT-qPCR assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry was performed to assess apoptosis. Protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was measured by Western blotting.\n\nRESULTS: High concentrations of B. coagulans Hammer derivatives significantly (P < 0.05) reduced viability of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells compared to untreated control. The results of RT-qPCR assay showed significant decrease in the expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2, and notable increase in the expression level of proapoptotic genes Bax, Bad, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells by B. coagulans Hammer derivatives. Flow cytometry demonstrated a high percentage of apoptotic HT-29 cells compared to untreated cells after exposure to B. coagulans Hammer derivatives. Western blotting analysis confirmed that treatment with EVs, UV-killed cells, and CFS significantly decreased Bcl-2 expression, and increased Bax expression in HT-29 cells.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that derivatives of probiotic B. coagulans Hammer can exert anticancer activity by induction of apoptosis in colon cancer HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. Further investigations are required to validate the safety and efficacy of B. coagulans Hammer derivatives in CRC prevention and treatment."

Nearly 20% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients develop liver metastases, and these patients are characterized by fewer and less active effector T cells. Preclinical work has shown that liver metastases cause systemic immunosuppression through siphoning neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells from systemic circulation with subsequent macrophage-mediated intrahepatic death. In preclinical models, liver metastasis-directed radiotherapy can reverse this systemic immunosuppression and sensitize tumors to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. However, it is unknown whether liver metastasis-directed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (liver SABR) can sensitize tumors to anti-PD-(L)1 in human NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: The HAMMER-NSCLC trial is a randomized phase II study planned to enroll 68 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC - without known targetable EGFR, ALK, BRAF, or ROS1 alterations - involving the liver. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care anti-PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy +/- platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) or standard-of-care treatment plus liver SABR (Arm 2). Patients can be enrolled and randomized up to the start of cycle 3 of immunotherapy. For patients in Arm 2, it is preferred that liver SABR be completed prior to initiating standard-of-care anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Liver SABR must be completed prior to the third cycle of anti-PD-(L)1 or within 90 days of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy initiation, whichever is sooner. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include the safety/tolerability of liver SABR when added to anti-PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy, overall survival, and hepatic progression. The study needs 68 patients combined in the two arms to demonstrate an improvement in PFS with a hazard ratio of 0.6 to provide 80% power with a one-sided alpha of 10%.\n\nDISCUSSION: The HAMMER-NSCLC trial will determine if adding liver SABR to first-line anti-PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy +/- platinum-based chemotherapy can improve median PFS in patients with NSCLC liver metastases.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05657873, registered 12/12/2022."

This study explored the photoprotective properties of Asparagus cochinchinensis extracts fermented with endophytic fungus Aspergillus aculeatus TD103. Compared to the unfermented control, TD103-fermented A. cochinchinensis demonstrated stronger radical scavenging and ferric ion reduction abilities in vivo, significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased the antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. It also downregulated the expression of the AP-1 and MMP genes, reduced the content of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1) and increased type I procollagen amino-terminal propeptide (PINP) levels in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. Non-targeted metabolomics and HPLC quantification revealed that elevated sarsasapogenin content may critically contribute to enhanced photoprotective capacity in Asparagus cochinchinensis. The safety assessment of fungus TD103 revealed that this strain was not drug resistant and did not produce mycotoxins, thereby indicating its safety for application. Eye irritation tests demonstrated the safety profile of the fermented extract, indicating negligible irritant potential. The TD103-mediated fermentation markedly potentiated the photoprotective capacity of A. cochinchinensis, ​providing a viable biotechnological platform for sustainable cosmeceutical development targeting UV-induced skin damage."

Klotho is a multifunctional protein crucial in ageing, metabolism, and ion homeostasis. It has been confirmed that Klotho serves as a critical protective factor across multiple biological systems, with its roles in neuroprotection, cardiovascular health, and renal function being particularly noteworthy. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of Klotho protein against oxidative and nitrosative stress in heart IRI through regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway. The study utilised in vitro human cardiomyocyte culture and ex vivo isolated rat hearts subjected to IRI. Recombinant Klotho protein was administered to evaluate its effects on heart mechanical function, gene and protein expression of NOS isoforms, oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, MMP activity, and lipid metabolism. Administration of Klotho significantly improved heart mechanical and contractile function following ischemia/reperfusion. Klotho normalised the expression and synthesis of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, resulting in reduced production of reactive nitrogen species and attenuated nitrosative stress. It also limited oxidative damage, reflected by decreased protein oxidation, and restored fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, Klotho regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and activity, thereby protecting heart contractile proteins from degradation. The Klotho protein exhibits significant cardioprotection in IRI by mitigating oxidative and nitrosative stress through the modulation of the NOS/MMP signalling pathway. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of Klotho in managing ischemic heart conditions and myocardial injury."

    "text": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a globally prevalent but intractable disease lacking effective pharmacotherapies. Here, we performed an integrated multilayered screening for pathogenic genes and druggable targets for MASH. We identified the subclass of metabolite-sensing G protein-coupled receptors, specifically GPR31, a critical contributor to MASH occurrence, which, to our knowledge, was previously uncharacterized. Mechanistically, Gαi3 is the essential downstream effector for the pro-MASH efficiency of GPR31 via glycosylation-dependent interaction with GPR31 and extra activation of PKCδ-MAPK signaling. Hepatocyte-specific GPR31 deficiency robustly blocked hepatic lipotoxicity and fibrosis in a mouse model of diet-induced MASH, whereas expression of the GPR31 transgene aggravated MASH development. Of translational importance, we developed a small-molecule inhibitor, named G4451, that specifically inhibits the GPR31-Gαi3 interaction by targeting the GPR31 conformational transition. Encouragingly, oral administration of G4451 effectively blocked MASH progression in preclinical models in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Collectively, the present study provides proof of concept that interference with GPR31 constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy for MASH."

We described all BEST1 variants identified in French patients analyzed at Lille University Hospital, between 2008 and 2024. A comprehensive analysis of each variant was performed based on in silico tools (at DNA, RNA, and protein levels), as well as a literature review providing clinical data and functional assays. All of these data were used to classify the variant pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria.\n\nRESULTS: We detailed 488 variants from the LOVD. Among 450 French patients, we identified 150 different variants, 40 of which were novel. We classified only eight variants as variants of unknown significance, four of which were already in the LOVD. We identified specific recurrent variants in the French population: p.(Gly26Asp), p.(Val90Met), p.(Val137Met), and p.(Ile230del), the last of which was present in 17 patients (3.8%). All new variants cause changes in chemical interactions within the protein and are associated with clinical pictures of bestrophinopathy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The study and comparison of these two large cohorts highlight variants specific to the French population, as well as differences in protein distribution, which are undoubtedly influenced by several population-specific factors. Through multiple in silico analyses, we were able to reclassify 93.3% of variants as likely pathogenic or pathogenic, thereby strengthening clinical diagnoses."

Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection."

The isolation and purification of EVs from biological samples are prerequisites for EV research.

In aqueous two-phase laminar flow, EVs with hydrophilic surfaces selectively migrate from the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) phase to the dextran (DEX) phase, which is accelerated by Dean flow. However, the proteins were still retained in the PEG phase due to the laminar effect and their surface properties. The separation performance of the DATPEC was investigated using breast cancer-derived EVs, and 91.1% EVs could be recovered from the cell culture medium supernatant with a protein removal rate of 95.6%. As a proof of concept, this technique was coupled with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to analyze surface proteins (EpCAM and EGFR) of EVs derived from eight cell lines. Fluorescent aptamers were specifically labeled on EVs, revealing the single-vesicle heterogeneity. In conclusion, DATPEC enables simple and efficient separation of high-purity EVs and exhibits the potential to be integrated with downstream techniques for EV analysis."

Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a powerful biochemical experimental technique that can characterize the impact of mutations on protein sequence-function relationships, allowing for rapid assessment of new mutations. Herein, machine learning (ML) models were built using the SARS-CoV-2 DMS data set, with the input features derived from the Rosetta-computed decomposition energy terms. To improve the performance of this physics-based model, we further incorporated local environment information (the number of residue pair-specific contacts within shells at different distances) as the input features. Alternatively, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on amino-acid sequence information as well as their physicochemical and biochemical properties was also employed, yielding predictions that achieved good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, compared to three popular protein language models, the dual-encoding CNN model demonstrated consistently superior performance on the SARS-CoV-2 DMS data set and seven additional DMS data sets for different biological properties. Furthermore, a transfer-learning strategy was applied to fine-tune the CNN model using recently reported DMS data sets for the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and XBB.1.5 variants, enabling the development of variant-specific prediction models. These ML models trained on DMS data sets can not only identify the effects of single-point mutations in mutagenesis data sets but also be useful in predicting the effects of multiple-point mutations and providing valuable information for ongoing viral surveillance efforts. Moreover, this dual-encoding CNN model, without including 3D geometric information, has the potential to be a robust and alternative ML model for other DMS studies."

However, the mechanism by which DUX4 exerts its toxicity remains unclear. In this study, we observed abnormal iron accumulation in muscles of patients with FSHD and in mice with muscle-specific DUX4 expression (DUX4-Tg mice). Treatment with iron chelators, an iron-deficient diet, and genetic modifications inhibiting intracellular uptake of iron did not improve but rather exacerbated FSHD pathology in DUX4-Tg mice. Unexpectedly, however, iron supplementation, from either a high-iron diet or intravenous iron administration, resulted in remarkable improvement in grip strength and running performance in DUX4-Tg mice. Iron supplementation suppressed abnormal iron accumulation and the ferroptosis-related pathway involving increased lipid peroxidation in DUX4-Tg muscle. Muscle-specific DUX4 expression led to retinal vasculopathy, a part of FSHD pathology, which was prevented by iron administration. Furthermore, high-throughput compound screening of the ferroptosis pathway identified drug candidates including ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Treatment with Fer-1 dramatically improved physical function in DUX4-Tg mice. Our findings demonstrate that DUX4-provoked toxicity is involved in the activation of the ferroptosis-related pathway and that supplementary iron could be a promising and readily available therapeutic option for FSHD."

    "text": "The dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) is composed of peripheral and integral membrane proteins at the muscle cell membrane that link the extracellular matrix with the intracellular cytoskeleton. While it is well established that genetic mutations that disrupt the structural integrity of the DGC result in numerous muscular dystrophies, the 3D structure of the complex has remained elusive. Two recent elegant cryoEM structures of the DGC illuminate its molecular architecture and reveal the unique structural placement of sarcospan (SSPN) within the complex. SSPN, a 25 kDa tetraspanin-like protein, anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, supporting the conclusions of biochemical studies that SSPN is a core element for DGC assembly and stabilization. Here, we advance these studies by revealing that SSPN provides scaffolding in δ-sarcoglycanopathies, enabling substitution of δ-sarcoglycan by its homolog, ζ-sarcoglycan, leading to the structural integrity of the DGC and prevention of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R5. Three-dimensional modeling reveals that ζ-sarcoglycan preserves protein-protein interactions with the sarcospan, sarcoglycans, dystroglycan, and dystrophin. The structural integrity of the complex maintains myofiber attachment to the extracellular matrix and protects the cell membrane from contraction-induced damage. These findings demonstrate that sarcospan prevents limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R5 by remodeling of the sarcoglycan complex composition."

    "text": "Bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) domain protein family are epigenetic readers that regulate gene transcription, cell-cycle progression, and DNA damage response (DDR), making them attractive therapeutic targets for sarcomas, which are epigenetically dysregulated and genomically unstable. Sarcomas are molecularly heterogeneous with a high propensity for metastasis, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. BET inhibitors (BETi) hold promise for the treatment of sarcomas, for they block interaction of BETs with acetylated lysines, modify gene expression, and create an imbalance in transcription and replication kinetics. BETis also disrupt transcriptional programs driven by oncogenic fusion proteins found in some sarcomas. Preclinical studies demonstrate efficacy of BETis in inducing apoptosis, disrupting DDR, and reducing tumor growth, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or other targeted agents, such as PI3K, histone deacetylases, and CHK1 inhibitors. Favorable results have been observed in clinical trials, but more studies are required to fully assess safety and efficacy as well as identify biomarkers of response and resistance. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing BETi safety and selectivity and exploring combination therapies, such as BETis with DDR inhibitors. This review summarizes the preclinical studies on BET inhibition and discusses clinical trial activity, providing insights into the potential of BETis in sarcoma therapy."

Studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of the anticaries vaccination, including the dose, plasmids, serum IgG and IgA levels after immunization, were included. Studies in which animals were used for anticaries vaccine were also included. Combining more than one trial was done to estimate the pooled intervention effect using the meta-analysis when studies examined the same intervention and outcomes with comparable methods in similar populations. The continuous data was pooled using the inverse variance method, and dichotomous data using the Mantel-Haenszel method.\n\nRESULTS: Out of 4701 records, only 17 publications met the eligibility criteria. Although all studies were assessed as having an overall low risk of bias, certain domains (D3, D5, and D7) exhibited a high risk across most studies. The pooled RR, derived using a random-effects model, was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.46-0.62), indicating a statistically significant 47% reduction in risk across studies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There is excellent potential for dental caries vaccines to transform oral health in the future. Various vaccines, such as Killed Formalin-treated Donor strain 2 - recombinant Protein Antigen c and anti-CAT-SYIIgY antibodies, have demonstrated prophylactic effects against Streptococcus mutans colonization on teeth. These interventions exhibit a sustained reduction in S. mutans colonization, which may contribute to the prevention of dental caries. A vaccination of this kind would significantly lower tooth decay prevalence and the financial and health costs that go along with it."

    "text": "Specific protein detection plays a crucial role in biological analysis and clinical diagnostics， serving as an essential tool for disease diagnosis， therapeutic monitoring， and biological research. However， conventional methods such as immunofixation electrophoresis （IFE） and western blotting （WB） suffer from complex workflows， time-consuming operations， and limited quantification capabilities owing to intricate staining and de-staining procedures. In addition， these traditional immunological detection methods require extensive manual handling and specialized expertise， while low levels of automation restrict their applicability to high-throughput or large-scale analysis scenarios. Moreover， the multistep nature of these methods increases the risk of experimental errors and compromises quantification accuracy.Herein， we present a quantitative protein immune polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis （PAGE） detection method that combines immune-recognition principles with online fluorescence imaging technology， thereby offering a rapid and specific approach for quantifying target proteins. The developed method exploits the specificity of fluorescently labeled antibodies and the separation capability of PAGE， with formaldehyde crosslinking used to stabilize antigen-antibody complexes under the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis， thereby ensuring reliable quantification. The entire experimental workflow can be completed within 1.5 h and consists of three main steps. Firstly， the target protein is incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies at room temperature for 0.5 h to form immune complexes， after which they are crosslinked using formaldehyde. The cross-linked samples are then loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and separated under optimized electrophoresis conditions （120 V， 15 min； 150 V， 15 min； 200 V， 15 min）. Electrophoretic separation is finally monitored in real-time using an online fluorescence imaging system， which enables direct visualization of protein migration and eliminates the need for post-separation processing. Three distinct bands are observed on the precast gel following immune PAGE separation： the immune complexes at the uppermost position， the free fluorescent antibodies in the middle， and other proteins at the bottom. ImageJ software is used to analyze the electrophoresis pattern， and quantification is achieved based on the linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the free antibody and the mass concentration of the target protein. We systematically validated the performance of the method using human transferrin （TRF） as the model antigen protein and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled （FITC-labeled） anti-TRF IgG antibody （anti-TRF IgG-FITC） as the detection probe， which involved analyzing three key aspects： the necessity of the formaldehyde-crosslinking step for maintaining immune complex stability， antibody recognition specificity in complex samples， and the linear correlation between the fluorescence signal and the mass concentration of the target protein. The method exhibited excellent analytical performance， with a linear range that extended between 5.0 and 200.0 mg/L and a correlation coefficient （"

Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the optimal cutoff value of the risk score. Subsequently, survival analysis was conducted in the training group (TCGA-OV) and external databases (GSE26712 and GSE63885), with the predictive efficiency of the risk signature evaluated through ROC curves.\n\nRESULTS: Prognosis was significantly better for patients in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group. Compared to single clinical features such as age and stage, the risk score had the highest diagnostic value for prognostic evaluation. Based on gene function and pathway analyses, differential genes were found to be related to oxidative stress. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that risk scores were associated with immunosuppressive cells such as M2 macrophages. Finally, the protein expression levels of the key gene CREB3 in OC tissues were evaluated in vitro.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study might provide significant value for exploring the relationship between disulfidptosis-related ferroptosis genes and OC, and its results may provide insights on new therapeutic targets for OC."

In humans, BMs also contain over 150 other secreted proteins, such as structural matrix components, enzymes and growth factors, as well as over 50 cell-membrane adhesion and signalling receptors. From this toolbox, BMs are tailored for tissue-specific functions, including filtration, shaping organs, connecting tissues and harbouring signals that guide cell migration and differentiation.

In Silico virtual screening suggested that prunetin (PRU) may activate GPER1 and inhibit RUNX2. To validate these findings in vivo, male Sprague Dawley rats were allocated into five groups: placebo-surgery (PS), PRU-treated PS, untreated UE, PRU-treated UE, and UE pretreated with G-15 (a selective GPER1 blocker) before PRU. Biochemically, PRU significantly restored hippocampal structure and behavioral functions impaired by UE, reduced serum IS levels, and replenished GPER1 expression. Additionally, it suppressed p-AKT, p-GSK3β, RUNX2, TLR4, and NF-κB, while enhancing cell survival by silencing the necroptotic signal (TICAM1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL) and restoring caspase-8. PRU also counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction by downregulating PGAM5 and p-DRP-1. Crucially, these beneficial effects were nullified by G-15, confirming the role of activated GPER1 in mediating PRU's therapeutic effects. Collectively, PRU-induced GPER1 orchestrated neural integrity signal UE/AKT/GSK-3β/RUNX2, inflammatory axis UE/TLR-4/NF-κB, necroptosis pathway (TICAM1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL), preventing mitochondrial dysfunction by suppressing the PGAM5/DRP-1 cue.

    "text": "Aging is the foremost risk factor for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis, which is a principal cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which line the vascular intima, play a central role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Their dysfunction, marked by impaired barrier function, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation, constitutes an early and pivotal event in atherogenesis. As key sensors of hemodynamic forces, ECs are constantly exposed to blood flow-induced shear stress, which exert divergent effects on metabolism depending on the flow pattern. Laminar flow with relatively high shear stress (LS), as a critical atheroprotective factor, maintains EC quiescence and promotes anti-inflammatory responses and antioxidant defense, whereas disturbed flow with low and oscillatory shear stress (OS), induces the athero-susceptible signaling network to activate glycolysis and inflammation in ECs. While genetic, epigenetic, and molecular signaling mechanisms in EC physiology and pathophysiology have been extensively explored, the crucial role of EC metabolism in EC dysfunction and atherogenesis remains largely understudied. By serving as precursors, intermediates, and end products of cellular processes, metabolites offer a dynamic snapshot of endothelial metabolic states under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. With aging, ECs undergo profound metabolic reprogramming, including disrupted glycolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered redox homeostasis. In healthy vasculature, ECs maintain quiescence and metabolic homeostasis, primarily relying on glycolysis for energy. With aging, the gradual accumulation of atherosclerotic risk factors, including oxidative stress, inflammation, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, drives metabolic reprogramming in ECs, particularly in regions exposed to disturbed flow with OS, ultimately leading to EC dysfunction and atherosclerosis. This review summarizes recent advances in age-related metabolic reprogramming in ECs and its contribution to atherosclerosis, particularly focusing on the dysregulation of glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial respiration induced by age and fluid shear stress. This review also outlines recent methodologies for profiling EC metabolism, and discusses potential therapeutic applications of targeting EC metabolism to prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis."

This retrospective, two-center cohort study included 80 ADPKD patients, with 40 receiving tolvaptan and 40 serving as controls. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), systemic inflammatory index (SII), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and renal function parameters such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria, were analyzed over a 1-year follow-up period. In the tolvaptan group, CRP, SII, PLR, proteinuria, and uric acid levels significantly decreased, whereas these markers increased in the control group. GFR remained stable in the tolvaptan group but declined significantly in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between GFR and inflammatory markers in either group. Our findings suggest that tolvaptan may contribute to reducing systemic inflammation in ADPKD patients while preserving renal function.

The median total energy intake was 1413 kcal (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1118, 1748) for children, 2227 kcal (95% CI = 1714, 2826) for adolescents, and 2552 kcal (95%CI = 1981, 3226) for women. The average proportion of energy from carbohydrates was above 69% for all target groups, while fat and protein accounted for just 20% and 10% in all groups, respectively. Animal protein accounted for only 11% of total protein intake in children, compared with 9.15% in adolescent girls and 9.78% in women. Usual calcium, vitamin B12, and vitamin A intakes were far below estimated average requirements, regardless of the target group or region.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Considering the risk related to very high micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin 12, urgent action needs to be taken in Niger through the accelerated implementation of the national roadmap on transforming local food systems for healthy diets."

    "text": "This article provides a thorough review of various analytical methods utilized for the identification and quantification of non-protein nitrogen (NPN) components in infant formula (IF), specifically focusing on key NPN components such as urea, nucleotides, and free amino acids. Quantifying these components is essential for ensuring the nutritional quality of IF. The review evaluates the sensitivity, specificity, and applicability of different analytical techniques when applied to a complex matrix (i.e., IF), highlighting the advantages and limitations inherent in each approach. Although numerous methods exist for quantifying the different NPN components, not all are rigorously validated. Additionally, many methods fail to adequately account for matrix effects, which can lead to significant discrepancies in reported values. This review underscores the importance of selecting validated analytical approaches that consider matrix effects to obtain reliable data on NPN components in IF. By enhancing the understanding of NPN quantification in infant nutrition, this work aims to highlight the importance of standardized and validated analytical protocols, thereby improving consistency in the identification and quantification of key NPN components in IF."

Despite its severity and aggressive nature, biomarkers that can serve as prognostic and predictive factors for ccRCC are lacking. ABCD3, a peroxisomal long-chain fatty acid transporter, has been shown to serve as a prognostic factor in both prostate and colon cancers. Thus, this study aimed to ascertain if ABCD3, which is highly expressed in kidney tissues, may also serve as a biomarker for renal cancer.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioinformatics and immunohistochemical staining were employed to systematically investigate the relationship between the ABCD3 gene and protein expression, the immune microenvironment, and survival outcomes in ccRCC. We extensively harnessed data from publicly available databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA), UALCAN, Gene Set Cancer Analysis, UCSC Xena, and various other databases.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ABCD3 is a novel biomarker for ccRCC and that the downregulation of ABCD3 expression, and other members of the peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation pathway may represent a unique molecular feature of ccRCC."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is the most life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). AH is characterized by severe inflammation attributed to increased levels of ethanol, microbes or microbial components, and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules in the liver. HSPB1 [Heat Shock Protein Family B (Small) Member 1; also known as Hsp25/27] is a DAMP released from stressed cells, including hepatocytes. The goal of this study was to define the role of HSPB1 in AH pathophysiology.\n\nMETHODS: Serum HSPB1 was measured in a retrospective study of 184 healthy controls (HCs), heavy alcohol consumers (HA), patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC), and patients with AH recruited from major hospital centers.HSPB1 was also evaluated in liver tissue from HC and AH patients, existing RNA-seq data from ALD patient liver and monocytes, and livers from mice fed a Lieber-DeCarli diet. Cellular models of hepatocyte and macrophage interactions were used to evaluate the role of HSPB1 in inflammation during AH.\n\nRESULTS: Circulating HSPB1 was significantly increased in AH patients, and levels positively correlated with disease-severity scores. HSPB1 was also increased in the livers of patients with severe AH and ethanol-fed mice. In cellular models, ethanol-stressed hepatocytes released HSPB1, which then triggered TNFα-mediated inflammation in macrophages. Anti-HSPB1 antibody prevented TNFα release from macrophages exposed to media conditioned by ethanol-stressed hepatocytes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings support investigation of HSPB1 as both a biomarker and therapeutic target in ALD. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that anti-HSPB1 antibody is a rational approach to targeting HSPB1 with the potential to block inflammation and protect hepatocytes, without inactivating host defense."

    "text": "The fermented botanical product (FBP) is a complex, primarily plant-based fermented food that has been popular among consumers for many years. Although FBP may modulate gastrointestinal function, the responsible factors and precise mechanisms remain unclear and speculative. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained widespread attention as a novel signaling system, not only in animals but also in plants and microorganisms. Here, we report that FBP contains EV-like nanoparticles composed of protein complexes originating from various lactic acid bacteria. When mice consumed the EV-like nanoparticle-enriched fraction of FBP as a beverage for three weeks, their body weight gain was reduced by up to approximately 10%, particularly in those fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet. Although the HF/HS diet induced colonic atrophy in mice, the ingestion of the EV-like nanoparticles-enriched fraction of FBP increased lipid efflux in feces by more than two-fold and improved the pathological images of the colon. In vitro experiments on lipase activity suggested lipase inhibitory activity in the EV-like nanoparticle-enriched fraction of FBP. Compound analyses revealed that ferulic acid was enriched in the EV-like nanoparticle fraction and inhibited lipase activity in vitro. The biological effects observed in this study were attenuated by reducing the amount of EV-like nanoparticles using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. However, the slight reduction (not statistically significant) in bioactivity in the PTFE-treated group compared with the polyether sulfone (PES) treated group, despite a marked decrease in ferulic acid content, suggests the possible involvement of additional molecules beyond EV-like nanoparticles in this fraction. These findings indicate that FBP may serve as a potential therapeutic option for obesity and gastric symptoms. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Extracellular vesicle-like nanoparticles in FBP may support health by alleviating obesity through the suppression of excessive intestinal lipid uptake. These findings suggest that FBP could be developed into a functional food or supplement for individuals who frequently consume high-fat diets."

    "text": "Melatonin, an indolamine primarily recognized for regulating circadian rhythms, has also demonstrated notable antitumoral properties. Melatonin induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, modulates autophagy, and promotes apoptosis in various tumors, including gastric, ovarian, cervical, oral tongue, colorectal, renal, hepatic, and bladder cancer. In placental choriocarcinoma, melatonin reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, its effects on ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway remain unexplored. It is hypothesized here that the proapoptotic effects of melatonin in choriocarcinoma cells occur through the activation of the UPR pathway. The factors implicated in the UPR (PERK, IRE1ɑ, ATF6, GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, P-eIF2α) pathways were evaluated by Western blot, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry in BeWo (human choriocarcinoma) cells treated with or without melatonin (1 mM). Melatonin significantly increased protein levels of GRP78 (p = 0.0329), IRE1α (p = 0.0394), p-eIF2α (p = 0.0439), ATF4 (p = 0.0267), CHOP (p = 0.0379), Bax and cleaved PARP but did not affect TRAF2 and NFkB protein levels nor XBP1 mRNA splicing. PERK knockdown, via siRNA, prevented the rise in GRP78, p-eIF2α/eIF2α, and ATF4 levels by melatonin. Additionally, melatonin increased early apoptosis in BeWo cells (p = 0.0371) and PERK knockdown increased the susceptibility of BeWo cells to apoptosis when treated with tunicamycin (p = 0.0359), suggesting that ER stress plays a role in BeWo cell survival. This study demonstrates that melatonin activates the PERK-ATF4-P-eIF2α-CHOP pathway and induces early apoptosis in BeWo cells, while PERK deficiency compromises cell survival under ER stress. Our findings suggest that modulating PERK-UPR signaling with melatonin could present a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, including placental choriocarcinoma."

However, traditional prognostic models based on stage alone cannot meet clinical needs. This study aims to establish a clinlabomics-based, highly accessible prognostic model for small cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a multicenter observational retrospective study, enrolling clinical laboratory data of 276 small cell lung cancer patients. The cohort from Sichuan Cancer Hospital comprised a total of 196 samples. Of these, 88 samples were designated as the internal validation set, while 80 samples from an alternate institution were allocated as the external independent validation set. Utilizing the log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, six prognostic indicators were discerned. A nomogram was subsequently developed based on these identified indicators.\n\nRESULTS: Through the log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, total protein (TP) (HR = 0.47, p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (HR = 1.82, p < 0.001), and lymphocyte ratio (Lym ratio) (HR = 0.47, p = 0.005) were identified as laboratory biomarkers related to prognosis from 61 blood-related laboratory tests, covering routine blood, biochemical, coagulation, and infectious disease markers, while age, stage, and smoking were identified as clinical independent prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed based on these six indicators. The AUC of time-independent ROC for 2- and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 0.74, 0.74 in the training cohort, and 0.64, 0.74 in the validation cohort, respectively. The novel nomogram accurately predicted the prognosis for two independent cohorts with p values < 0.001 and performed risk adjustment, which classified patients with different OS at the same extensive stage (ES) or limited-stage (LS).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinlabomics-based nomogram helps to more effectively predict the prognosis of small cell lung cancer by leveraging blood laboratory data."

It has been shown that eCIRP is linked to various types of programmed cell death and acute inflammation. However, the role of eCIRP in chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis has not been elucidated. Accumulating evidence indicates that renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) play a significant role in renal fibrosis. C23, a small molecular peptide inhibitor of eCIRP, has been implicated as a therapeutic agent in the context of acute inflammation and tissue injury. PANoptosis or synchronized cell death is observed as simultaneous triggering of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. However, its role in renal fibrosis is not known. We therefore hypothesize that eCIRP induced-chronic inflammation and injury in RTECs are mediated by PANoptosis and that inhibition of eCIRP by C23 decreases RTEC PANoptosis and attenuates renal injury and fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) injury. By using primary RTECs, we demonstrated that eCIRP induces inflammatory cytokines, Z-DNA-binding protein-1, and other PANoptosome markers and markers of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. We then substantiated that C23 downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and inhibited PANoptosis in the RTECs. Using the UUO mouse model, we demonstrated renal cell PANoptosis and renal fibrosis 7 days after UUO. Importantly, treatment with C23 effectively inhibited PANoptosis and concurrently ameliorated renal fibrosis. Taken together, eCIRP induces inflammation and PANoptosis in RTECs, whereas C23 inhibits PANoptosis in these cells and attenuates renal fibrosis in UUO mice."

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate predictive performance.\n\nRESULTS: High GATA3 expression (≥ 60%) was detected in 92.5% of cases. Elevated GATA3 levels were significantly associated with reduced PFS and OS. IPTW-adjusted Cox regression confirmed high GATA3 expression as an independent adverse prognostic factor. ROC curve analysis demonstrated strong predictive performance for CMF progression (AUC = 0.867), with an optimal cutoff of 57.5% (sensitivity 73.7%, specificity 94.3%). For clinical applicability, a 60% threshold was adopted.\n\nCONCLUSION: High GATA3 expression is an independent adverse prognostic biomarker in early-stage CMF.

Therefore, the homeostasis of VEGFR-2 internalization and recycling is critical for maintaining the normality of the VEGF signaling pathway and regulates angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain containing 2 (DCBLD2) can promote the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) by promoting the VEGF signaling pathway, but the potential role of DCBLD2 on VEGFR-2 endocytosis remains unclear. Herein, we found that the deletion of Dcbld2 in mice pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) interfered in progression of VEGFR-2-positive vesicles in cytoplasm returning to the membrane, which functioned by increasing the association of VEGFR-2 with Rab5, while decreasing the association with Rab11. Knockdown of DCBLD2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired VEGFR-2 recycling in the same way as that in PMVECs. The deletion of Rab5 in WT PMVECs further attenuated VEGFR-2 signaling induced by VEGF, and overexpression of Rab11 in PMVECs with Dcbld2 deletion showed recovery of VEGF-induced signaling. Finally, EC-specific Dcbld2 knockout mice showed that DCBLD2 plays a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis. As a receptor-regulating protein, DCBLD2 accelerates the process of VEGFR-2 returning to membrane, which promotes VEGF signaling in ECs and promotes angiogenesis in mice, potentially presenting to be a new therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases associated with EC damage."

Today, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) enhances skin quality by promoting collagen synthesis, elasticity, and hydration. Minimal invasive aesthetic treatment could add value to this patient group.\n\nMETHODS: To assess the relationship between menopause, hormones, and HRT on skin health, we conducted a comprehensive literature search using the terms (menopause OR menopausal) AND (aging OR aging) AND (skin) AND (estrogen OR estrogen OR hormones) AND (hormone replacement therapy OR HRT). To explore aesthetic treatments specific to menopausal women, searches included (\"menopause\" OR \"menopausal\") AND (\"aesthetics\" OR \"aesthetics\" OR \"cosmetic\" OR \"filler\"). Additional studies were identified from references in the uncovered articles.\n\nRESULTS: We reviewed the impact of hypoestrogenism and HRT on menopausal skin and identified unmet needs in its aesthetic management. Most studies reported positive associations between HRT and improvements in menopausal skin aging, but findings were sometimes inconsistent. Despite decades of research, clinical guidelines do not support HRT use solely for estrogen-deficient skin due to a lack of robust clinical trials on skin-specific therapy. Many women remain unaware of the skin-related impacts of menopause, which can affect quality of life, and few aesthetics studies analyze data based on menopausal status or HRT use. Given the growing demand for aesthetic treatments in this population, future studies should intentionally incorporate demographic data and analyses on menopausal status and HRT use."

    "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organs, with clinical manifestations, disease progression, and response to therapy varying among individuals. This effect is mainly caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. In recent decades, other genes and their allelic variants, beyond CFTR mutations, have been proposed as genetic modifiers of CF phenotype. For instance, different polymorphic β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) polymorphic variants have been reported in CF individuals and appear to influence correct receptor function. β2AR belongs to the βAR family, which includes three subtypes: β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR. These receptors are crucial G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types and serve as key modulators of cAMP production, making their function particularly relevant in CF pathophysiology. β2AR is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells, and studies revealed that it plays a crucial role in modulating CFTR activity and smooth muscle contractility through cAMP signaling. For these reasons, β2-agonists are widely used in clinical healthcare to treat patients with obstructive airway disorders, including CF. Emerging evidence has also supported a role for β3AR, which is expressed in the canine and human bronchial epithelium and have been reported to enhance ciliary motility and regulate CFTR function, making it a potential therapeutic target in CF."

    "text": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Reliable novel noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis are urgently needed in clinical practice. We aimed to investigate the accuracy of plasma Follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL-1) in the diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases.\n\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: We collected cross-sectional clinical data for a derivation cohort (n = 86) and a validation cohort (n = 431), totaling 517 subjects with liver biopsy. Advanced liver fibrosis was defined by the METAVIR pathological score (F ≥3). Dual cutoff values for diagnosis were explored. In the derivation cohort, plasma FSTL-1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with advanced liver fibrosis, with an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.96). In the validation cohort, plasma FSTL-1 maintained good diagnostic performance, with an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.92). Plasma FSTL-1 levels were significantly associated with individual histological features of the METAVIR scoring system, including interface hepatitis, lobular necrosis, and hepatocellular ballooning (p < 0.0001). A cutoff value ≤ 0.43 ng/mL was the optimal rule-out threshold, with a sensitivity of 84.62% (95% CI, 76.46%-90.30%) and a specificity of 79.51% (95% CI, 74.81%-83.53%), while ≥0.50 ng/mL was the best rule-in threshold, with a specificity of 86.41% (95% CI, 81.06%-90.43%) and a sensitivity of 70.67% (95% CI, 64.41%-76.23%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma FSTL-1 has high diagnostic accuracy and could potentially reduce the need for liver biopsy in identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis."

    "text": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In multiple sclerosis (MS), neurodegeneration results from the interplay between disease-specific pathology and normal aging. Conventional MRI captures morphologic changes in neurodegeneration, while quantitative MRI (qMRI) provides biophysical measures of microstructural alterations. Combining these modalities may reveal how aging and pathology interact and contribute to disability progression in people with MS.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional and longitudinal morphometry data from 1,353 patients with MS and 3,462 healthy controls (HCs). In addition, cross-sectional qMRI data, available for 378 HCs and 169 patients with MS, were analyzed separately. Morphometric measures and quantitative metrics were used to estimate brain-predicted age differences (brain-PADs) with machine learning. We assessed the added value of quantitative metrics over a model based exclusively on morphometric measures in brain age prediction. We also investigated the associations of brain-PADs derived from conventional and qMRI-based predictive models with clinical disability, serum inflammatory biomarkers of neuroaxonal and astrocytic injury, and lesion burden.\n\nRESULTS: Models combining morphometry and qMRI data achieved the best performance (mean absolute error: 5.73), outperforming those based on qMRI (6.62) or morphometry alone (8.00). Cross-sectional and longitudinal morphometry-based brain-PAD correlated with clinical disability, serum neurofilament light chain, and serum glial fibrillary acidic protein levels (all\n\nDISCUSSION: Integrating qMRI improves brain age predictions. Brain-PAD serves as an imaging biomarker to quantify MS-associated aging and track disability and neuroinflammation progression."

    "text": "The treatment of open wounds presents a significant challenge in clinical practice due to the increased risk of bacterial infections and prolonged recovery times. Currently, antibiotics are highly preferred to address underlying problems; however, their misuse has led to antibacterial resistance and compromised biocompatibility. This underscores the need for an advanced biological macromolecule-based system with multifunctional properties. Herein, we report a gelatin-based hydrogel dressing integrated with MXene and zingerone (GPM Z) to manage open wounds. Nanocomposite hydrogels demonstrated porous networks, hydrophilic nature, and rheological behavior, ensuring their reliability in a physiological environment. The sustained release of zingerone from hydrogels promotes prolonged therapeutic effects while minimizing side effects associated with burst release. In vitro analysis confirms >80 % antioxidant potential as determined by DPPH assay, hemolysis (<5 %), n-HDF cells compatibility, and antibacterial activity of nanocomposite hydrogels, which can be tuned by varying MXene concentration in hydrogels. In vivo analysis highlights the effectiveness of GPM-5 Z hydrogel in facilitating wound closure (98.75 % by day 14). The synergistic interplay of MXene and zingerone enhances wound healing by combining MXene antibacterial potential and bio interactive surface supporting cell proliferation with zingerone antioxidant activity that mitigates oxidative stress, thereby facilitating collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, and angiogenesis."

However, most studies have focused on low protein diets to stimulate autophagy and reduce ageing-related factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological, metabolic and molecular effects of a 7-day plant-based FMD with low protein/high fat (LP) and high protein/low fat content (HP) in healthy humans and compare those responses to a non-intervention comparator control group.\n\nMETHODS: Forty six healthy men and women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CONTROL (isoenergetic diet), n = 16 (mean ± SD age 35.0 ± 9.5 yrs, BMI 23.3 ± 2.7 kg\n\nRESULTS: Both FMDs reduced body weight and fat mass (interaction effects P < 0.0001) but only HP-FMD reduced visceral fat mass relative to CONTROL [mean difference (95 % CI): -0.09 (-0.15 to -0.03) kg, P = 0.006]. Both FMDs reduced fasting plasma glucose by ∼10 % [LP-FMD: -0.41 (-0.80 to -0.02) mmol\n\nCONCLUSION: Both FMDs promoted cardiometabolic health and induction of autophagy, with HP-FMD selectively conferring novel benefits in body composition, circulating lipid profiles, heart rate variability and gut microbiome health.

Primary exposure was the multidimensional Protein source Quality Index (PQI), a previously defined metric ranging from 0 to 39.5, categorized into four levels based on cut-off points of 0.5, 1, and 2. The PQI encompasses multiple components: the types of protein-rich food sources, their essential amino acid composition, the healthfulness of these sources according to international dietary guidelines, and their impact on climate. Multivariable-adjusted associations (linear mixed models and Cox proportional hazard ratios) were examined between baseline PQI and two outcomes: long-term weight changes over an 18-year follow-up period, and the incidence of overweight and obesity.\n\nRESULTS: Among 12,908 participants with an initial body mass index <25 kg/m\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that a high PQI could be inversely associated with the incidence of overweight/obesity in a cohort of middle-aged adults and highlight the substantial role of PQI in long-term weight management.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL: NCT02669602 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02669602?term=SUN&locStr=Spain&country=Spain&rank=4)."

Using the International ImMunoGeneTics information system numbering scheme, we identified specific positions with distinct amino acid enrichment for each MHC class and developed machine learning models for classification. While our frequency-based approach effectively differentiated MHC-I from MHC-II TCRs in cross-validation, performance declined when only beta chain data were used from real-world peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. However, incorporating the TCR alpha chain significantly improved accuracy, emphasizing its importance for MHC recognition. Overall, we found that V-region loops can signal MHC class bias, aiding in immunotherapy design and TCR repertoire analysis, while highlighting the need for larger, more diverse datasets for reliable predictions."

    "text": "Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as NASH, represents one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Its high prevalence is driven by insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with cardiovascular disease. The main driver of liver damage is fat accumulation in hepatocytes leading to inflammation and fibrosis development. People with MASH and clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2/F3) are 'at risk' of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and are considered in need of treatment. Metabolic drivers of MASH originating outside the liver, for example, from the adipose tissue and the gut, and genetic heterogeneity contribute to making the prevalent pathogenetic factor difficult to dissect at an individual level. In this scenario, the Food and Drug Administration's conditional approval of the liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist Resmetirom as the first pharmacological treatment for MASH last March 2024 and the expected extension of the glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonist Semaglutide indication from diabetes and obesity to MASH mark a key milestone. Both drugs are also under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency. The proven efficacy of these compounds in clinical trials needs to be balanced against safety profiles and patient preferences. To investigate future trajectories and possible uses as mono-therapy or in combination, we examined available results of clinical trials and real-life studies. Despite the need to await the final results of outcome studies to exclude any possible challenges for both compounds, safety profiles and external factors including reimbursement policies or supply limitations may currently guide the individual choice."

This study investigates the anti-urolithiasis potential of sericin, a silk protein sustainably extracted from Bombyx mori cocoons, and its innovative nanoparticle formulations. Biocompatible sericin, sericin nanoparticles, and sericin coupled with a phytate chelator were developed and meticulously characterized. In in-vitro assays, sericin modified with phytate demonstrated the most potent antioxidant activity (IC50: 39.5 μg/mL) and the highest calcium oxalate stone inhibition (∼92 %, IC50: 30.1 μg/mL). It also exhibited significant antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and uropathogenic E. coli. In-vivo studies revealed improvements in urinary, blood, and serum parameters, reduced renal crystal size, and absence of tissue toxicity, as confirmed by histopathological analysis. This is the first report demonstrating sericin's efficacy in the prevention and treatment of urolithiasis in a rat model. Sericin nanoparticles, especially those crosslinked with phytate (PASS-NP), effectively crossed the compromised glomerular filtration barrier, localized in renal tubules, and disrupted calcium oxalate crystallization. The enhanced activity is attributed to the synergistic effects of sericin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, and phytate's calcium-chelating and permeability-enhancing role. PASS-NP treatment showed significant crystal dissolution, reduced hematological disturbances, improved renal biomarkers, and strong antibacterial action against stone-promoting pathogens. These findings position sericin-based nanoparticles as multifunctional, biocompatible therapeutic agents offering a minimally invasive, eco-friendly, and cost-effective strategy for urolithiasis management potentially reducing drug load, recurrence, and healthcare costs."

In this study, the cDNA sequence of an i-type lysozyme was obtained from Litopenaeus vannamei, and designated as LvLysi3. Following stimulation by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, transcripts of LvLysi3 in shrimp intestine, hepatopancreas and hemocytes was significantly up-regulated. Activity assays with recombinant protein showed LvLysi3 had agglutination activity and antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we found that LvLysi3 possessed high thermal stability and robust acid resistance, while also being non-toxic to human cells, ensuring the safety and potential application of this lysozyme as a feed additive. The incorporation of LvLysi3 into the feed could mitigate the detrimental effects of V. parahaemolyticus on L. vannamei by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Additionally, it promoted an increase in beneficial intestinal bacteria and reduced the abundance of V. parahaemolyticus. Moreover, feeding shrimp with LvLysi3 enhanced their innate immune response and facilitated pathogen phagocytosis by hemocytes, thereby decreasing the mortality rate associated with bacterial infections in shrimp. This study identifies an eco-friendly strategy to enhance shrimp health and control bacterial diseases of shrimp."

Understanding the dynamics of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in septic patients, particularly those with AKI, could improve the monitoring and prediction of renal outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate fluctuations in oxidative stress and antioxidant capacities in septic patients with and without AKI at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and one week later. In addition, it sought to investigate the potential correlation between specific oxidative stress and antioxidant markers and renal outcomes.\n\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional and follow-up study was conducted, involving 124 critically ill septic patients. The patients were divided into groups according to the presence of AKI at admission to the ICU. Epidemiological, clinical data, and biochemical measurements of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were collected on days 1 and 7 of ICU admission.\n\nRESULTS: The results indicated that plasma concentrations of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were significantly higher in patients with AKI on both evaluation days. Notable differences in antioxidant capacities, including plasma glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase, were observed between the two groups. In patients with AKI, plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity demonstrated a close relationship. Specifically, plasma GSH concentrations on day 1 were correlated with increased odds of major adverse kidney events within 14 and 28 days (MAKE14 and MAKE28), while elevated plasma GPx activities on day 7 were associated with reduced odds of MAKE14 and MAKE28.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Monitoring plasma GSH concentrations on the 1st day of ICU admission, in conjunction with the evaluation of plasma GPx activities on the 7th day, may serve as pivotal indicators for predicting renal outcomes in critically septic patients."

A 25(OH) vitamin D concentration ≤ 15 ng/mL was defined as vitamin D deficiency, within 15-30 ng/mL as vitamin D insufficiency, and > 30 ng/mL as serum 25(OH) vitamin D sufficiency. A hs-CRP level ≤ 2.5 mg/L was considered low, whereas a hs-CRP level > 2.5 mg/L was considered high. TNF-α was classified as low or high with an 8.2 pg/mL cutoff level based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. P values < 0.05 were considered to be significantly associated with albuminuria.\n\nRESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more commonly observed among T2D patients with albuminuria than those without albuminuria (adjusted OR = 7.34, 95% CI = 2.3-23.6, p = 0.001). Higher serum TNF-α levels (TNF-α > 8.2 pg/mL) were more frequently associated with the presence of albuminuria in T2D patients (adjusted OR = 6.77, 95% CI = 1.61-28.4; p = 0.009). Similarly, elevated serum hs-CRP levels (hs-CRP > 2.5 mg/L) were more commonly found among patients with T2D and albuminuria than in those without (adjusted OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.4-15.8; p = 0.012).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is a significant correlate of albuminuria in T2D patients, independent of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and basic inflammatory markers including hs-CRP and TNF-α. Moreover, serum hs-CRP > 2.5 mg/L and TNF-α > 8.2 pg/mL were each individually associated with a significantly increased likelihood of albuminuria in T2D patients."

    "text": "The Envelope (E)-protein is a key structural element of enveloped viruses that plays a significant role in host-pathogen interactions, viral growth, and hijacking of host innate immune system. Due to lack of antiviral agents and significant adverse effects and less affordability of vaccines, the E-protein targeted drug development is gaining critical attention among the researchers. The present review explores the structural and genomic diversities of E-protein among animal viruses with special interest to flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses. E-protein's viroporin activity damages host cell membrane and induces inflammation that advances the disease progression. The review also explains the viroporin-mediated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs)-linked cellular mechanisms in virus-mediated inflammation. The E-protein is considered an alternative promising antiviral target as its functional domain is conserved. This review further enlists the natural, and synthetic inhibitors of E-protein in the development of antiviral agents based on computational, in vitro, and in vivo studies. The E-protein's universal conservation ability to fasten to cellular membranes and limited structural data imparts significant challenge to selective drug inhibition. The present review highlights that the E-protein together with multiple viral factors will boost treatment performance while minimising viral resistance. In addition, broad-range inhibitors targeting E-proteins have the potential to produce single treatment solutions in combating viral infections including several viral strains. In conclusion, E-protein targeted drug would be beneficial in developing potential antiviral agents with high drug specificity, and less viral resistance."

    "text": "In marine species, including bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, reptiles, and birds, arginase is the final enzyme in the urea cycle within the liver. This review aims to highlight the anticancer activity of these enzymes. The metalloenzyme L-arginase (also called L-arginine amidohydrolase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. Up till now, L-methioninase has been partially studied in some bacterial species. It is necessary to study L-arginase and L-methioninase in marine microorganisms and to optimize cultivation conditions for both enzymes using the most potent isolates. Maximum activity of L-arginase occurs under optimal conditions when temperature, carbon and nitrogen sources, and L-arginine concentration are selected. The specific activity of the enzyme was 111.383 units/mg with a yield of 4.522 and a multiplicity of 5.622 % when precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 40 % saturation. Partially purified L-arginase was eluted from gel filtration with a multiplicity of 10.627 and a recovery of 7.132 %. L-arginase, derived from the submerged cultures of the heat-tolerant fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, exhibited strong resistance to high temperatures at 40 °C and displayed a threefold increase in its attraction to L-arginine (Km 4.8 mM). The substrate specificity of the enzyme was evaluated against different substrates such as L-arginine and L-asparginine. The enzyme showed good affinity to L-arginine with 112 U/mL. It was found to have very low specificity for d-arginine and least specificity for others. The enzyme showed higher antiproliferative activity on Jurkat cell lines, clone E6-1, compared to other tested cell lines. These changes reflect significant differences in the regulation of biochemical processes, which is obviously manifested in the possibilities of survival and development in a particular environment and can be considered a manifestation of \"biochemical adaptation\" to certain environmental conditions."

Timely detection of precancerous lesions for patients with chronic HBV infection is critical in preventing worse consequences. The purpose of this study is to reveal the key serum metabolic biomarkers that can be applied to the early recognition of HCC in patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis.\n\nMETHODS: Blood samples from patients with LC, HCC, and healthy subjects were collected, and endogenous metabolites in serum were detected by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Differential metabolites (DM) were screened, and metabolic pathways and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signals involved in DM were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Metabolomics results revealed that patients with LC and HCC had significantly different metabolic characteristics. Patients with LC and HCC shared 22 biomarkers, LC had six different biomarkers, and HCC had 10 different biomarkers. The expressions of these metabolites all showed significant differences between groups. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the differential biomarkers of LC were primarily involved in the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis, while the differential biomarkers of HCC were mainly involved in the regulation of endogenous androgen signaling, mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, and purine metabolism signaling. The common biomarkers are enriched in bile acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism.\n\nCONCLUSION: We clarified the blood metabolism characteristics of LC and HCC. These findings provided potential endogenous metabolic indicators for early recognition of HBV-chronically infected cirrhotic patients who may progress to HCC."

    "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic organelle that undergoes significant morphological alterations in response to cellular stress. While conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has provided valuable insights into these changes, such as the formation of crystalloid-ER and ER whorls, obtaining comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) information on these large structures within their cellular context has remained a challenge. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces an innovative application of dual-axis scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography to investigate ER morphology under stress conditions in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing the cation channel polycystin-2 (PC-2). Benefitting from high-resolution, increased depth-of-focus, and reduced aberrations, STEM tomography enabled the detailed 3D reconstruction of large cellular subvolumes, providing unprecedented views of stress-induced ER structures. Our findings reveal distinct ultrastructural details of both crystalloid-ER and ER whorls. Crystalloid-ER exhibited a tubular architecture with potential interconnectedness, while ER whorls displayed a lamellar organisation and distinct membrane curvature. We observed the co-occurrence of these distinct smooth ER (sER) morphotypes within the same cell, yet they remained spatially separated, suggesting potential functional specialisation. Furthermore, we identified direct membrane contacts in mixed morphotypes, hinting at a shared origin or dynamic relationship between these structures. The study also elucidated the interactions of these organised smooth ER (OSER) structures with other organelles, such as mitochondria (MAM sites) and vesicles. In summary, the presented ultra-structural insights have a significant impact on our understanding of stress-related ER morphology changes. The ability to visualise the intricate 3D architecture and spatial relationships of these structures provides novel perspectives on the ER's adaptive responses to stress, including potential roles in lipid and protein biosynthesis and intracellular communication. These findings underscore the power of dual-axis STEM tomography for elucidating complex organellar organisation and dynamics in their native cellular context."

However, the reasonable steaming time had not occurred, and bioactive components of potential mechanisms of YHS for CAG were still unclear. Thus, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the necessity of steaming processing of YHS before using it in clinical via mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). During 1-10 min, changes in volatile components (VOCs) were measured by headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and components of YHS were observed via high-performance liquid analysis (HPLC) in steaming processing to analyze the optimum steaming time. As well as investigating the mechanism of YHS for CAG by using network pharmacology. Overall, berberine, coptisine, columbamine, jatrorrhizine, and magnoflorine were markedly increased after steaming of YHS that the best time of 5-7 min. The VOCs were significantly changed, which mainly include 2-phenylacetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, and alpha-terpinolene. Furthermore, the compound-target-disease networks and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were performed, which involve PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathway subsequently. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics were performed; the sanguinarine, berberine, and saulatine were key components to regulate HSP90AB1 and MAPK3 of YHS for CAG."

Inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism (IECMs) are inherited genetic defects resulting in improper transport, modification, or utilization of cobalamin and include inherited methylmalonic acidurias, a group of IECMs most frequently caused by a defect in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme. Here, we performed genome-scale modeling of IECMs to gain insight into their metabolic perturbations. First, we simulated deficiencies in 11 IECM-related genes and demonstrated that they cluster based on impaired metabolic pathways. Next, we leveraged RNA sequencing data from fibroblasts of 202 individuals with methylmalonic aciduria and 19 unaffected controls to construct and interrogate personalized metabolic models. Finally, we analyzed fluxes differing between patients depending on reported symptom presentation. Our findings reveal that (i) metabolic pathways including fatty acid metabolism and heme biosynthesis have reduced flux in IECMs, (ii) in personalized simulations, succinate and fumarate production and heme biosynthesis are impaired, especially in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, (iii) one-carbon metabolism reactions such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase and folylglutamate synthase have reduced flux in all individuals with methylmalonic aciduria, and (iv) specific metabolic pathways are up- or down-regulated according to symptoms, including failure to thrive and hematological abnormalities, and treatments, such as antibiotics and protein restriction. Overall, our study delineates metabolic pathways perturbed in IECMs. In future applications, our modeling framework could be applied to other rare genetic diseases or used to predict personalized therapeutic or dietary interventions."

It typically presents with cardiomyopathy or hepatic failure in early childhood; however, it may rarely present in adulthood with the neuromyopathic form.\n\nMETHODS: We describe a patient with MTPD with isolated neuropathy mimicking Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) as the first and only presenting symptom. Clinical and electrophysiological examinations were conducted, including nerve conduction studies, needle electromyography, muscle and nerve biopsies. The diagnosis was confirmed with genetic testing and enzymatic analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts.\n\nRESULTS: We report a 40-year-old man diagnosed with axonal CMT2 in childhood. He had pes cavus and hammer toes, mild distal lower limb weakness, and loss of vibration sense with areflexia. He later developed fatigability, improved exercise tolerance with alcohol and an episode of chest infection causing neurological decompensation without evidence of rhabdomyolysis. Neurophysiology showed non-length-dependent axonal sensorimotor neuropathy without myopathic features. Genetic testing confirmed that he was compound heterozygous for two HADHA variants, one of them novel, and enzymatic analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed MTPD.\n\nINTERPRETATION: We report a very rare isolated neuropathic phenotype of MTPD and confirm the pathogenicity of the novel variant c.1003G>A, p.(Glu335Lys). This case also highlights the need for HADHA and HADHB to be included in neuropathy gene panels as MTPD may present as CMT. Given that dietary management may prevent some complications of MTPD, achieving a diagnosis early is important."

Combining bioactive small molecules with biodegradable scaffolds presents a promising way to improve bone repair. This research focused on developing and testing a poly(ε-caprolactone)/gelatin (PCL/Gel) scaffold that was co-loaded with atorvastatin and silybin, two small molecules that promote bone growth, to enhance bone regeneration in a rat calvarial defect model. The scaffolds were made using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS), incorporating different amounts of atorvastatin and silybin. Physicochemical characterization included SEM, FTIR, porosity, compressive strength, degradation rate, contact angle, and drug release profile. In vitro, evaluations involved checking MG63 cell viability, hemocompatibility, and cytotoxicity. In vivo, performance was assessed in a rat model of critical-size calvarial defects using micro-CT, histology, and quantitative real-time PCR to measure key gene expression related to bone formation. The optimized scaffold (PCL/Gel with 24 μg/mL silybin and 19.75 μg/mL atorvastatin) showed high porosity (80 %), suitable mechanical strength (8.02 ± 0.95 MPa), and sustained drug release (atorvastatin: 68 % at 288 h; silybin: 48 % at 576 h). Cell viability exceeded 100 %, and hemolysis remained below 5 %. In vivo findings showed a 19.4 % closure of the bone defect after 8 weeks, which was higher than the single-drug group (7.2-17.5 %) or the drug-free group (15.2 %).

G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), a lipid sensor regulating insulin sensitivity and inflammation, has gained attention as a promising target.\n\nAREAS COVERED: This review evaluates 25 patents and peer-reviewed studies (2020-2025) on GPR120 agonists. It highlights potent thiophene derivatives (EC₅₀ < 50 nM), sulfonamides, and stable fatty acid mimetics. Special attention is given to β-arrestin-biased agonists that improve glucose control (25% AUC reduction), improve insulin sensitivity (30% glucose drop), and reduce inflammation (40% TNFα inhibition). These compounds enhance GLP-1 secretion (a 2-fold increase), offering triple therapeutic benefits for diabetes. Sources were identified through a structured search of recent scientific literature and databases.\n\nEXPERT OPINION: GPR120 agonists, particularly β-arrestin-biased ligands, hold significant potential for T2DM treatment by modulating glucose homeostasis and inflammation. However, challenges like receptor desensitization and translational barriers such as species-specific receptor expression, off-target activity, and suboptimal pharmacokinetics must be addressed. Future research should optimize drug design to enhance efficacy and safety, paving the way for novel metabolic disorder therapies."

Prior studies yielded heterogeneous results, ranging from decreased to increased intestinal permeability in AN. This study aimed to assess intestinal permeability in adolescent patients with AN by comparing serum markers Zonulin, Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and intestinal Fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) with healthy controls (HC) over time.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study on 60 female adolescent patients with AN and 36 age-matched HC. Blood samples were collected at admission to inpatient treatment, at discharge, and at a one-year follow-up. Zonulin, LBP, iFABP and inflammation marker Interleukin 6 levels were measured alongside clinical parameters. Linear mixed models were applied to assess group differences and longitudinal changes. Pearson correlations were used to explore clinical associations.\n\nRESULTS: Zonulin levels were significantly decreased in the AN group at admission and again at the follow-up compared to HC. LBP levels were consistently reduced in AN across all three time points. These alterations thus persisted despite weight recovery. No significant differences were observed in iFABP levels between the groups or over time. Zonulin and LBP positively correlated with Interleukin 6, linking gut permeability to inflammatory processes.\n\nCONCLUSION: Decreased Zonulin and LBP levels suggest reduced paracellular intestinal permeability in adolescent AN while transcellular permeability (iFABP) appears to be rather unaffected. The persistence of these alterations despite weight recovery suggests that reduced intestinal permeability may be a trait rather than a state marker in AN. Our findings challenge the concept of a \"leaky gut\" in adolescent AN.This highlights the need for further research on the intestinal barrier in AN, while also integrating the role of nutritional intake, gut microbiome interaction and immune reactions, to support the development of gut-targeted therapies."

The intensity of the inflammatory response appears as the principal driver of the changes involved in outcome, and especially those affecting protein metabolism and muscle catabolism, and resistance to nutrition. The present exploratory study aims to clarify the role of the different cytokines in amino acid metabolism.\n\nMETHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of the previously published observational study, including 51 critically ill patients and 49 healthy controls aiming at identifying patient changes in amino acid metabolism, we assessed the association between a panel of cytokines and blood levels of amino acids (AA) and their turnover. The subjects were matched for age, sex, and BMI. The study was conducted in postabsorptive state. Blood analysis included cytokines (determined by Luminex), C-reactive protein (CRP or hsCRP), and AA.\n\nPROTOCOL: 8 mL solution containing 18 stable AA tracers administered as a pulse to calculate amino acid whole body production (WBP). WBP was calculated from fitted decay curves. We measured amino acid enrichments and concentrations by LC-MS/MS and derived statistics using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) t and stepwise regression. Data as means [95%CI].\n\nRESULTS: The study included 51 critically ill patients (age 63 yrs [58, 68], APACHEII 21.6 [20, 24]) and 49 matched healthy controls (age 57 yrs [52, 61]). While anthropometric characteristics were similar between critically ill patients and healthy adults, phase angle was lower (3.9 [3.5, 4.2] vs 6.0 [5.6, 6.3], p < 0.001), most AA blood levels were lower, while most cytokine levels were significantly higher. IL-6 and CRP were strongly associated (p < 0.001). IL-6 was the cytokine with the strongest association with the AA blood levels and WBP alterations in patients. Three patterns of changes in the plasma cytokine concentrations were observed. Of the 37 cytokines measured, 12 were higher in ICU patients, 5 were lower, and the rest were similar.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows a comprehensive picture of inflammation and simultaneous alterations of AA metabolism. The levels of IL-6 and CRP may become a good indicator of the metabolic capacity to respond positively to nutrition therapy.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: Data are from the baseline measurements of study NCT02770092 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02770092) and NCT03628365 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03628365)."

However, existing evidence lacks consistent evaluation across varying follow-up durations, while the specific factors influencing their safety and effectiveness remain undetermined. This study aims to evaluate the quality of evidence regarding the safety, efficacy, and impact factors of applying the resorbable bio-inductive collagen implant clinically to repair rotator cuff injuries.\n\nMETHODS: The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022367522). A systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to October 2024) for clinical studies on bio-inductive collagen implants for rotator cuff repair. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality (using RoB1 for RCTs, NOS for cohort studies and JBI critical appraisal tools for case series). Primary outcomes included postoperative tendon thickness, shoulder function scores (ASES/Constant), and re-tear rates. Data were analyzed using random/fixed-effects models to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs, with subgroup analyses for tear type, patient age, and postoperative mobilization time. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 17.0.\n\nRESULTS: Seventeen studies were included. The meta-analysis results showed that postoperative tendon thickness of the patients increased statistically compared with the baseline, at 3 months (MD = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.61, 2.83; p < 0.001), 6 months (MD = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.44, 3.16; p < 0.001), 12 months (MD = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.58, 2.72; p < 0.001), and 24 months (MD = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.02, 2.08; p = 0.045). Postoperative shoulder joint function improved significantly. The ASES score and Constant score of the patients were significantly higher than the baseline at 6 months (ASES: MD = 35.90; 95% CI: 32.97, 38.83; p < 0.001), 12 months (ASES: MD = 40.83; 95% CI: 37.56, 44.10; p < 0.001; Constant: MD = 28.59; 95% CI: 21.44, 35.74; p < 0.001), and 24 months (ASES: MD = 39.80; 95% CI: 31.32, 48.27; p < 0.001; Constant: MD = 32.84; 95% CI: 28.72, 36.97; p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The bio-inductive collagen implant is effective and safe for healing rotator cuff injuries. Patient age may be an important moderator affecting its efficacy. The impact of tear size and postoperative activities on efficacy needs to be further explored through in-depth clinical studies."

E1 and E2 proteins of HCV can produce neutralizing antibodies and are often used to screen potential epitopes. In this study, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293F) cells were used to generate highly active HCV E1 and E2 proteins, which were then used as antigen for producing mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Novel B cell epitopes of E1 and E2 were disclosed using monoclonal antibodies for the first time. Based on the epitopes, three multi-epitope (MEP) antigens were designed and prepared including non-structural proteins and novel identified B cell epitopes in E1 and E2 in HCV 1b, 2a, 3a, 6a subtypes. Double antigen sandwich enzyme immunoassay was established based on the MEPs to detect HCV serum antibodies, showing potential diagnostic application.

    "text": "Selenium, an essential trace element with a narrow nutritional window, plays critical roles in human health primarily through selenoproteins. Its dual nature, being vital yet potentially toxic, underscores the importance of precise intake. Geographical disparities in soil Se content lead to widespread dietary deficiencies, driving the advancement of Se-fortified foods. Food selenium fortification strategies are implemented through modern techniques, including selenium application to soil or foliage, crop genetic engineering, microorganism-mediated transformation, and direct supplementation of animal feed or processed foods. Selenium compounds ingested through selenium-fortified foods are typically categorized into inorganic and organic types. Organic (e.g., selenoamino acid) and inorganic (e.g., selenate) selenium are absorbed and transformed through amino acid transport pathways and ion transport pathways, respectively, and this distinction leads to differences in their metabolism and toxicity. Excessive selenium is toxic and characterized by nerve damage, hair/nail loss, and gastrointestinal complaints, which can lead to death in severe cases. Organic forms exhibit superior bioavailability, higher nutritional value, and lower toxicological risks. This review comprehensively examines the preparation methods, commonvarities, and the impacts of selenium fortification on these foods. The conversion of various primary dietary selenium compounds in the human body is compared, and the impact of dietary selenium supplementation on human health is evaluated. Additionally, the recommended selenium intake ranges for different age groups specified by various countries and regions are highlighted, with the aim of guiding individuals to scientifically supplement selenium."

This review systematically examines the latest research progress and application prospects of drug synergy and antagonism prediction methods that integrate protein three-dimensional spatial structure with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This review showcases the molecular biological mechanisms of drug synergism vs antagonism mediated by transcription factors, signal pathway regulation, and membrane transport proteins, and subsequently delves into the molecular structural basis of protein-drug interactions, including precise identification methods for drug binding sites, optimization strategies for molecular docking techniques, and the mechanisms and structural characteristics of multi-target drugs. The review systematically evaluates the practical application progress of AI technologies, especially machine learning and deep learning algorithms, in predicting drug synergy-antagonism effects, as well as the methodological approaches for constructing and evaluating the performance of AI prediction models that integrate multi-source biological data. These research findings provide a solid theoretical foundation for the precision treatment of cancer, infectious diseases, and metabolic disorders, with significant clinical and translational implications for advancing personalized medicine strategies in clinical practice and facilitating the rational design and development of novel multi-target drugs."

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Few things feel more invigorating than lacing up your hiking boots and exploring a new trail . From the sun-drenched days of summer to crisp autumn afternoons, hiking connects you with nature while feeding the mind, body, and soul. The newest trend to hit the trails? “Soft hiking,” which is all about keeping things light and intentional. We spoke with experts to learn six soft hiking techniques that actually build more strength than gym workouts after 45. Soft hiking emphasizes moving with purpose at a comfortable pace. You’re still challenging your body while weaving through uneven terrain and engaging your muscles without excessive load. “It uses less intense and slower therapeutic movements, balance, and resistance to natural bodyweight instead of high-impact movements,” says Shahinaz Soliman, MD , board-certified family physician with 20+ years of experience in patient care. “This modality is appropriate in people over 45 because it encourages building strength at a long-term, low-risk level that honors joint health and recovery requirements.” Inclines introduce a fresh challenge to your hike. Choose easy upward slopes while keeping your step-ups slow and steady. “This is a natural increase of glutes, hamstrings, and calves without the use of heavy weights,” says Soliman. Why People Are Ditching Regular Walks for ‘Nordic Walking’ Navigating objects like rocks and logs is another way to instantly boost the effectiveness of your hike. “The introduction of natural obstacles promotes the use of stabilizer muscles that are not given serious attention in gym machines,” Soliman says. 5 Walking Moves That Shrink Belly Fat Faster Than the Gym After 45 Don’t forget about working your arms! “Trekking poles or recreating arm movements will use upper body muscles and enhance overall coordination and calorie expenditure,” Soliman points out. Balaram Thapa , CEO of Nepal Hiking Team, notes to position the poles so that your elbows are near 90 degrees, and “plant-pull” with every step. Complete six sets of two-minute efforts on rolling ground, activating your core. When going downhill, descend slowly. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e “Slow, controlled [descent] is one of the most effective methods to strengthen quadriceps and enhance balance, compared to walking normally,” Soliman notes. Here’s How Long Your Incline Walking Workout Should Be To Shrink Belly Fat Weave some bodyweight exercises into your hike. The key is pausing and holding the movement. “Pause in lunge or half-squat poses a few times on the way to activate the core and leg muscles in the isometric mode with minimum load on the joints,” Soliman instructs. The #1 Walking Method To Shrink Belly Fat Fast After 50, According to a Trainer Thapa recommends hill repeats: climbing for three to four minutes, descending gradually, and repeating for four to six rounds in total. “Keep steps short, drive through the mid-foot, and breathe rhythmically,” Thapa says. According to Soliman, “Soft hiking combines various muscle groups dynamically and functionally in a natural setting, which puts greater pressure on the body as compared to isolated gym work. Balance, a controlled movement, and weight-bearing activities in uneven terrain encourage the neuromuscular coordination and stability of the joints.” Thapa says soft hiking loads various planes of movement. “[In addition, it] builds eccentric control, and [challenges] balance. You strengthen feet, ankles, knees, and hips together while protecting joints with self-selected pace and terrain.” Outdoor exercise promotes longer workout sessions and sustainability. In adults 45+, this equals safer strength gains and far less boredom that’s often associated with standard gym routines. Looking for easy ways to lose fat?

If you’re on a weight loss mission, your diet matters as much as hitting the gym. Being consistent with healthy meals plays a major part in dropping unwanted pounds and what you eat for dinner can make all the difference. While fad diets get a lot of attention on social media, trends don’t always deliver long-term results, but eating the right food does. To help kickstart your wellness journey, here are five dinners that are packed with flavor, nutrition and can help you slim down in 30 days, according to nutritionist Rania Batayneh , MPH author of the bestselling book, The One One One Die t. According to Batayneh, this salmon dish proves healthy and can also be quick and delicious. “Chilean salmon isa nutrition powerhouse, packed with omega-3 fats, vitamin D, and other nutrients that keeps your heart, brain, eyes, and joints happy. It is also one of the lowest-mercury seafood options and an FDA “Best Choice” for families. I often recommend,” She adds, “Chilean salmon because it delivers so much nutrition in a safe, affordable way. Keep a few frozen fillets on hand and you can have dinner on the table in minutes since they thaw in just 15 minutes. Served with asparagus and a tangy lemon dill yogurt sauce, this meal is fresh, flavorful, and satisfying.” Ingredients (Serves 2) 2 Chilean salmon fillets (4–5 ounces each) 1 bunch asparagus, bottoms trimmed 1 tbsp olive oil Salt and pepper, to taste 2 tbsp Greek yogurt 1 tbsp lemon juice 4 cherry tomatoes 1 tsp fresh dill, chopped Instructions 1. Heat a skillet over medium heat. Sear salmon skin-side down for 4–5 minutes, then flip and cook another 4–5 minutes, until cooked through. 2. In the same pan, sauté asparagus until tender. 3. Stir together Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and dill for the sauce. 4. Plate salmon with asparagus, spoon the sauce over top, and finish with cherry tomatoes. He Lost 100 Lbs After Stopping These 5 Eating Out Mistakes Protein 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e This Shrimp Fajita Bowl with Sorghum is a colorful, one-pan meal that layers shrimp, peppers, and onions over whole grain sorghum. Batayneh explains, “Sorghum is naturally gluten-free and provides essential nutrients including protein, fiber, iron, and antioxidants. As a source of fiber and resistant starch, sorghum helps regulate blood sugar levels, supports healthy digestion, and contributes to satiety. Finished with zesty spices, lime, and cilantro, this recipe is simple, flavorful, and nourishing. Ingredients (Serves 4) ½ cup dry whole grain sorghum (about 1½ cups cooked) 2 lbs shrimp, peeled and deveined 2 bell peppers, sliced 1 small red onion, sliced 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp chili powder 1 tsp cumin ½ tsp garlic powder Salt and pepper, to taste Fresh lime wedges and cilantro, for garnish Instructions 1.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and sauté until shrimp are pink andvegetables are tender, about 5–7 minutes. 4. Divide sorghum into bowls and top with shrimp and vegetables. 5. Garnish with lime and cilantro. Salmon is already a powerhouse of lean protein and omega-3 fats, but when you add pistachios, you boost both flavor and nutrition. “Pistachios bring plant-based protein, heart-healthy fats, and fiber to the plate, along with 30 vitamins and minerals,” says Batayneh.  “In this recipe, the jalapeño pistachios form a crunchy crust that pairs perfectly with the zesty cilantro-lime marinade, creating a dish that’s as nourishing as it is delicious. Roasted with potatoes, it’s a balanced meal that supports steady energy, satiety, and overall wellness.” Ingredients (Serves 4) 2 cups fresh cilantro 2 cloves minced garlic ⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, divided Zest and juice of 1 lime 4 (5 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets, about 1–1½ inches thick ½ cup jalapeño pistachios, divided 1½ pounds small potatoes, halved ½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, divided Instructions 1.

Remove air, seal, and marinate for 20 minutes in the refrigerator. 3. Add ¼ cup pistachios to the reserved marinade in the processor, pulse, and transfer to a bowl. Set aside. 4. Toss potatoes with ¼ teaspoon salt, ⅛ teaspoon pepper, and 1 tablespoon oil. Spread on baking sheet and roast for 15 minutes. 5. Remove sheet, stir potatoes, then move them to the sides. Remove salmon from marinade, tapping off excess, and place in center of pan, skin-side down. Discard marinade. Season with remaining salt and pepper. Bake until potatoes are tender and salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. 6. Plate salmon and potatoes. Garnish with reserved pistachio mixture and remaining pistachios. This ABC Taco Salad is all about avocado, black beans, and cilantro. “Black beans bring plant-based protein and fiber that help keep you full and satisfied, while also providing key minerals like iron and magnesium,” Batayneh explains. She adds, “Creamy avocado steps in for cheese or sour cream, adding healthy fats and a rich texture. A squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro brighten the dish, making it as flavorful as it is nourishing.” Serve it as a hearty salad, enjoy it in warm corn tortillas, or pair it with rice for a balanced bowl. Ingredients (Serves 6) Cooking spray 2 cans (15 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained 1⁄4 cup water 2 avocados, peeled, pitted, and finely chopped 1 cup halved cherry tomatoes 1/2 cup cilantro fresh, chopped 1⁄4 cup finely chopped sweet onion 1⁄4 teaspoon salt 3 limes, cut in half *6 corn tortillas (gluten-free)- optional Instructions: 1.

We strive to only recommend                  products that adhere to our philosophy of eating better while still enjoying what you eat. Strength training after 40 might seem trickier than it was in your 20s and 30s, but the essence stays the same. It’s about staying powerful, protecting your joints, and building the kind of strength that supports everything from weekend activities to long-term health. Standing exercises are one of the best tools to get there. They engage your entire body, demand balance, and keep your core active while you move through strength-building patterns . Unlike traditional dumbbell routines that isolate one muscle group at a time, standing movements challenge multiple muscles together. This creates a stronger foundation for daily life and reduces your risk of injury. You’re not just training arms or legs—you’re training stability, coordination, and control in ways that carry over to real-world movement. The payoff is more than stronger muscles . Standing exercises improve posture, help protect your spine, and keep your hips, knees, and shoulders moving well as you age. That combination keeps you feeling younger, more capable, and less likely to deal with aches that slow progress. The six exercises ahead show how dumbbells can be used in creative ways that go beyond the basics. Each one builds strength that lasts, supports resilience, and helps you get more out of every workout after 40.  Side bends strengthen the often-neglected oblique muscles that protect your spine and improve rotational control. Past 40, building strength in the midsection goes beyond looks—it supports posture, protects your back, and helps you generate power in other lifts. Muscles Trained: Obliques, abdominals, erector spinae, hip flexors How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps per side. Rest for 45 to 60 seconds. Best Variations: Suitcase carries, side planks with reach, kettlebell side bends Form Tip: Keep your shoulders stacked and avoid twisting your torso as you bend. 5 Power Exercises That Torch Belly Fat Faster Than Treadmill Workouts After 45  The push press builds explosive upper body strength while engaging the lower body for added support. It mimics athletic movement and teaches your body to transfer power from the ground up. After 40, this type of coordinated effort keeps your joints mobile and your muscles firing together. Muscles Trained: Shoulders, triceps, quadriceps, glutes, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps. Rest for 75 to 90 seconds. Best Variations: Barbell push press, single-arm push press, kettlebell push press Form Tip: Keep your core tight and avoid overarching your back as you drive the weights overhead. 5 Daily Bodyweight Exercises That Keep You Young After 40  Ski swings replicate the explosive hip drive of kettlebell swings but with dumbbells held at your sides. This builds posterior chain strength, cardiovascular endurance, and total-body coordination. For those over 40, it offers a safe yet effective way to enhance athleticism and conditioning. Muscles Trained: Hamstrings, glutes, lower back, shoulders, forearms How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 12 to 15 reps. Rest for 60 seconds. Best Variations: Kettlebell swing, alternating dumbbell ski swing, resistance band ski swing Form Tip: Hinge at your hips rather than squatting. The power should come from your glutes, not your arms. 5 Driveway Stretches That Reverse Stiffness Better Than Massage Therapy After 50  Woodchops train rotational strength and core stability, which are critical for longevity and performance. This movement extends to sports, daily tasks, and injury prevention. After the age of 40, training the body in twisting motions helps keep your spine strong and resilient. Muscles Trained: Obliques, abdominals, shoulders, hips How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps per side. Rest for 60 seconds. Best Variations: Cable woodchop, medicine ball rotational slam, landmine twist Form Tip: Rotate through your hips and shoulders together. Avoid twisting only through your lower back. If You Can Hold a Bridge for This Long After 50, Your Glutes Are Stronger Than Most  Split squats build unilateral lower body strength, improve balance, and reduce muscle imbalances. For adults past 40, this move is a joint-friendly way to develop leg power and stability without heavy barbell loading. Muscles Trained: Quadriceps, glutes, hamstrings, calves, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps per leg. Rest for 60 to 75 seconds. Best Variations: Bulgarian split squat, front-rack split squat, bodyweight split squat Form Tip: Keep your torso upright and avoid letting your front knee cave inward.  The see-saw row builds upper back strength and core stability in a dynamic manner. Unlike traditional rows, alternating sides challenge balance and force your core to resist rotation. After 40, this is a valuable way to strengthen your posture and maintain a healthy back. Muscles Trained: Lats, rhomboids, rear delts, erector spinae, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 10 to 12 reps per arm. Rest for 60 seconds. Best Variations: Single-arm dumbbell row, kettlebell alternating row, barbell bent-over row Form Tip: Brace your core and keep your chest lifted to avoid rounding your back. 9 Best Daily Exercises for Women Over 50 to Sculpt a Lean Waistline Strength training after 40 should focus on movements that maintain your power, resilience, and mobility. Standing exercises achieve all of this by combining strength with balance, core control, and athletic coordination.

Losing belly fat after 45 doesn’t have to mean cutting out everything you enjoy. What makes a real difference is choosing the correct movements that keep your metabolism working, torch calories , and strengthen the muscles that matter most. The body responds differently to training as you age. Hormonal changes, a slower metabolism, and less lean muscle all play a role in how stubborn belly fat feels. But that doesn’t mean it’s untouchable. By incorporating a few smart, targeted moves into your routine, you can create daily wins that add up to significant changes in your waistline .

Muscles Trained: Core, shoulders, lats, triceps, glutes, quads How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps. Rest 60 seconds between sets. Best Variations: Rotational med ball slams, side-to-side slams, overhead scoop slams Form Tip: Drive through your hips, not just your arms, for more power and calorie burn. 5 Driveway Stretches That Reverse Stiffness Better Than Massage Therapy After 50  Few moves compare to sled pushes for fat loss. The heavy resistance challenges your lower body while forcing your core to stabilize. This creates high-intensity effort that drives calorie burn during and after training, boosting your metabolism long after you’ve finished. Muscles Trained: Quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves, core, shoulders How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 6 to 8 pushes of 20 to 40 yards. Rest 90 seconds between pushes. Best Variations: Sprint-style sled pushes, backward sled drags, light sled sprints Form Tip: Keep your heels low to the ground for maximum power transfer and safety. If You Can Hold a Bridge for This Long After 50, Your Glutes Are Stronger Than Most  Walking lunges double as a strength move and a conditioning tool. They target large lower body muscles that drive fat burning while engaging the core with every step. Done daily, they improve balance, coordination, and calorie expenditure, making them an efficient belly-fat fighter. Muscles Trained: Quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, core How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 sets of 10 to 12 lunges per leg. Rest 60 seconds between sets. Best Variations: Weighted walking lunges, reverse lunges, lateral lunges Form Tip: Avoid letting your front knee cave inward. Drive through your heel to engage your glutes fully.  Kettlebell swings combine cardio and strength training in one explosive move. The hip hinge motion builds glute and hamstring strength while the rapid pace elevates your heart rate. This makes them one of the most efficient exercises for fat loss and metabolic conditioning. Muscles Trained: Glutes, hamstrings, quads, core, shoulders, back How to Do It: Recommended Sets and Reps: Perform 3 to 4 sets of 15 to 20 swings. Rest 60 to 90 seconds between sets. Best Variations: Single-arm kettlebell swings, double kettlebell swings, American swings Form Tip: Keep your back flat and hinge at the hips rather than squatting to protect your lower back. 5 Daily Bodyweight Exercises That Keep You Young After 40 Training is the spark, but daily habits are the fuel that keeps fat loss burning strong. Simple choices in how you eat, recover, and move throughout the day can amplify your results and make fat loss sustainable long term. Think of these habits as the secret layer of consistency that accelerates progress and helps you maintain a leaner midsection for years to come. Looking for easy ways to lose fat?

In...</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.eatthis.com/5-daily-bodyweight-exercises-after-40/\">5 Daily Bodyweight Exercises That Keep You Young After 40</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.eatthis.com\">Eat This Not That</a>.</p>\n\nWe've consulted with our team of licensed nutritionists              and dietitians to bring you informed recommendations for food products, health aids and nutritional goods to                safely and successfully guide you toward making better diet and nutrition choices.

Something as simple as training with your own body weight can get real results. In fact, bodyweight exercises are “ more functional ,” recruiting a greater number of joints and muscles simultaneously, channeling everyday movement. That’s why we spoke with an expert who shares five daily bodyweight exercises that keep your body young , fit, and strong after 40. Keep in mind that “nothing changes without tension,” says Joy Puleo, M.A., NCPT , director of education at Balanced Body. “To create change and build muscle, you need to challenge the body by creating overload or tensioning the structure and it is the tension that leads to the desired adaptations, muscle strength and endurance.” These daily moves are effective because the way you position your body in relation to gravity promotes total-body toning and strengthening. 6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e “For example, with a pushup, the body is roughly parallel to the ground,” Puleo explains. “As the body lowers toward the ground, the work to maintain the plank posture is challenged as ground forces transfer from the upper body through the core to the legs, creating full body tension and overload. The closer to the ground the body goes, the harder the push away from the floor becomes, the more force the body must overcome the more strength and endurance that is created.” If You Can Do These 4 Bodyweight Exercises After 50, You’re Stronger Than 90% of Your Peers  “This is an isometric exercise—a static hold,” Puleo points out. “Studies are showing that isometric exercises build strength and endurance relatively quickly … Your posture is important here—your head, your ribcage, your pelvis through the legs to the heels should create a long, straight line. Maintaining this line is important to how the forces transfer from the upper body, through the core, to the legs.” These 6 Bodyweight Moves Build Core Strength Faster Than Planks After 40  “Dynamic exercises like planks change the body’s relationship to gravity while also moving multiple joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, and shoulder blades,” Puleo notes. “This increases muscle strength around moving joints, changes the way forces are put into and need to be responded to and teaches the nervous system how to coordinate movement relative to gravity.” ​​ 4 Daily Exercises That Reverse Muscle Loss Faster Than the Gym  The side plank is similar to a classic plank, but because you’re balancing on one arm and facing the side, your obliques and side body muscles require strength, endurance, and stability.  Squats are one of the most practical and powerful bodyweight moves. “They build strength, endurance and neuromuscular coordination of the lower body while integrating the legs with the core,” Puleo says. 3 Daily Movements That Keep Your Body 10 Years Younger After 44  “The lunge is directly related to walking and functional reciprocal leg motion,” Puleo tells us.

Not sure if its placebo tho\nOmega-3 - I want to improve my brain functions as I usually space out a lot and there are a lot of times when I am talking to people, whenever they speak to me all I hear is noise and I cant make out the words that they are saying. Lots of times they need to keep repeating themselves which is embarassing and i sometimes dont even wanna talk to people anymore cause im scared of it happening.\nVit C + Collagen: To have a better skin because my skin kind of looks dull and dry. \n\nI also started exercising and want to build muscle so also got a Protein Powder and Creatine. All of these seems too much and I'm wondering if I would just be doing more harm than good to my body.

    "combined_text": "Title: For those with anxiety disorder and overactive bladder (urinary urgency), alkalising the urine with baking soda 200 mg daily may greatly reduce the anxiety\n\nPost: I have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), and on some days, my anxiety flares up much higher than normal. \n\nI theorised that my high anxiety days might be precipitated by irritation of my bladder lining, as I have overactive bladder (aka irritable bladder), and on days when my anxiety is worse, I often have increased urinary urgency. The main symptom of overactive bladder is urinary urgency (having to go to the toilet urgently several times daily).\n\nDoing some research online, I read that acidic urine can irritate the bladder lining. So I then started to experiment with making my urine less acidic, doing this by taking baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) 200 mg daily, away from meals. Baking soda is an alkalising agent, and so counters urine acidity. By alkalising the urine in this way, I hoped my bladder lining would be less irritated, and hoped this would reduce my anxiety.\n\nSure enough, after I started taking baking soda 200 mg daily, I noticed that my high anxiety days completely disappeared! Normally I would have around 2 days a week with much higher anxiety levels than normal. But I have been taking baking soda 200 mg daily for over two months now, with zero high anxiety days. So this trick with baking soda seems to work for me.\n\n\n\nHow does alkalising the urine with baking soda reduce anxiety? What might be the mechanism? Well many mental health conditions — including anxiety, depression, OCD, bipolar, ADHD, anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia and autism — have been now  linked to inflammation in the body and brain, and some researchers think that this neuroinflammation could be the underlying cause of the mental symptoms, since brain inflammation greatly disrupts brain operations.\n\nThe way the immune system works, if inflammation is detected in the body organs (such as the intestines, stomach, bladder, liver, etc), this information is signalled up to the brain by the vagus nerve, and in response, the brain ramps up its own internal inflammation levels. This increased neuroinflammation in the brain could then precipitate or worsen mental symptoms.\n\nNow overactive bladder is linked to ongoing chronic inflammation of the bladder lining (ref: [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9289139/)). So it could be that in people who have overactive bladder, irritation of the bladder lining from acidic urine may worsen bladder inflammation, thus increasing brain inflammation, which in turn could exacerbate mental symptoms such as anxiety.\n\nAround 17% of the population suffer from overactive bladder (ref: [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5903463/)), so this condition is not uncommon.\n\n\n\nOf course, I cannot be sure that this is the actual mechanism by which alkalising the urine reduces my anxiety. But for those with overactive bladder as well as generalised anxiety disorder (or panic disorder), it might be worth experimenting with 200 mg or more of baking soda daily, taken away from meals.\n\nFor the purpose of urine alkalisation, drugs.com says baking soda oral dosing is from 325 to 2000 mg, taken 1 to 4 times a day (re: [here](https://www.drugs.com/dosage/sodium-bicarbonate.html#Usual_Adult_Dose_for_Urinary_Alkalinization)). However, if you take higher daily doses of baking soda, eg 1000 mg daily, I find you can become slightly lightheaded, as baking soda will make the blood very slightly more alkaline, and alkaline blood in turn causes constriction of blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to lightheadedness. However, I do not notice any lightheadedness side effects on 200 mg daily.\n\nBaking soda should be taken away from meals, as it reduces stomach acid levels, and this can interfere with digestion.\n\nNote that the pH levels of the blood and body tissues are very tightly controlled, and moderate amounts of baking soda will barely change body pH levels. Blood pH is normally tightly maintained between 7.35–7.45. Baking soda will however substantially increase urine pH to make the urine less acidic.\n\n\n\nPossibly urine alkalisation might also help other psychiatric conditions as well, like depression, OCD, bipolar, ADHD, anorexia nervosa, etc, if people with these conditions also suffer from overactive bladder.\n\nUrine alkalisation is also known to help prevent kidney stones."

I have zero affiliation w the company, just a cheapskate that loves finding and sharing deals"

How did it go?\n* Any tips to optimize training or diet?\n* Any recommendations for recovery strategies or supplements?\n\nReally looking forward to your experiences and advice! 🙏"

I did my measurements again because I am so unhappy with how I look and I’ve gained an inch on waist and hips and 8 pounds in weight. I’m devastated.\n\nIn February photos I’m so slim and snatched. Now I just feel huge. I appreciate of course  consistent lifting is probably what’s caused this, but it’s so demoralising. \n\nIt’s the first time I’ve stuck to a program for as long as this. And nothing else has changed save for getting off the pill in November (I’m 41F). I feel so lost on what to do now."
