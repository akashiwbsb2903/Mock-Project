    "text": "Cuproptosis represents a novel form of mitochondria-dependent cell death, demonstrating a unique antitumor potential. However, tumor cells have evolved robust metabolic compensation mechanisms that mitigate the cytotoxic effects of copper ions; this barrier must be disrupted to trigger cuproptosis. In this study, a metallic metabolic nano-regulator (MC@BSA; MC, manganese-copper nanocomposite; BSA, bovine serum albumin) is designed, which efficiently accumulates in tumor tissues and disrupts copper homeostasis by inhibiting copper efflux and promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). MC@BSA perturbs the copper ion equilibrium, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, lipoylated protein aggregation, and ATP depletion. MC@BSA downregulates the PKM2/HIF-1α/DLAT signaling axis, effectively decoupling glycolysis from the mitochondrial metabolism and enhancing the cellular sensitivity to cuproptosis. The therapeutic potency of MC@BSA is augmented by the addition of a PKM2 activator (TEPP-46) to form an MC@BSA + TEPP-46 complex. TEPP-46 stabilizes PKM2 in its tetrameric form and inhibits its nuclear transcriptional functions, thereby intensifying metabolic disruption and oxidative stress, and amplifying the antitumor efficacy. In vivo experiments confirm that MC@BSA + TEPP-46 suppresses tumor growth without inducing significant systemic toxicity, highlighting its therapeutic safety and robust pharmacological profile. This strategy advances the understanding of copper-mediated cell death mechanisms and introduces a powerful avenue for metabolic intervention in cancer therapy."

While cationic materials are widely utilized for cfDNA capture, their safety during in vivo delivery remains a critical concern. Additionally, macrophage-mediated inflammatory responses exacerbate disease progression. Here, we propose a charge-reversal and enhanced nanoassembly responsive to the inflammatory microenvironment, composed of a block polymer termed polycaprolactone-poly (N, N-dimethylacrylamide)-thioketal-polyethylene glycol (PCL-PDMA-TK-PEG, PPTP), a copolymer methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly-l-lysine-2,3-dimethylmaleic anhydride (mPEG-PLL-DMA, PLM), and 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI). Charge reversal in acidic inflammatory microenvironments and ROS-responsive enhancement of positive surface charge, significantly improving cfDNA capture efficiency within inflammatory sites. Mitochondrial targeting through electrostatic interactions, promoting 4-OI release to inhibit macrophage-driven inflammation. Reduced protein shielding during systemic circulation, enabling precise accumulation in inflamed joints. The 4-OI@PPTP/PLM nanoassembly effectively suppresses inflammatory cytokine production, mitigates synovial hyperplasia, and attenuates bone erosion in collagen-induced arthritis models. This strategy integrates cfDNA scavenging with microenvironment reprogramming, offering a dual-action therapeutic platform for RA management."

These approaches will enable novel gene therapy treatments as well as other nucleic acid and protein therapies, while doing so in a manner that is noninvasive, improves drug efficacy, and reduces systemic side effects. Despite the exciting potential of delivering macromolecules to the lungs, there has been only one therapeutic (i.e., Pulmozyme®) approved by the FDA in the last 30 years. The significant challenges to pulmonary delivery have hindered the development of many potential treatments. These challenges include the stability of proteins/nucleic acids during both encapsulation and delivery, the clearance mechanism of the airway and lungs, and the safety of the delivery vectors. Researchers have developed multiple approaches and materials to address these issues, including modification of the macromolecule, development of novel materials (polymers, lipids, and inorganics) for fabricating nano/microparticles, and the addition of excipients to the formulation. In this review article, we summarize and compare synthesis methods, encapsulation, delivery, controlled release strategies, and the shortcomings of recently developed prospective pulmonary protein/nucleic acid delivery vectors."

In this study, we developed a series of novel D-π-A structured fluorescent probes (PM-1, PM-2, PM-3, and PM-4), Among which PM-4 demonstrates weak monomer emission (540 nm) in aqueous solution. The pyridine side chain of PM-4 forms hydrogen bonds with the dual carboxylate groups of Asp/Glu, triggering the formation of emissive excimers. This process generates a new, enhanced red-shifted emission peak at 630 nm, enabling specific detection. The detection limits reached 1.26 μM (Asp) and 1.29 μM (Glu), with high selectivity. The formation mechanism of the probe-analyte complex was confirmed by NMR titration experiments. PM-4 successfully monitored diurnal fluctuations of Asp/Glu in saliva samples from healthy volunteers and concentration variations after smoking, revealing a correlation with emotional states (e.g., peak concentrations observed 10 min after smoking). The developed PM-4 probe integrates high sensitivity, selectivity, providing a powerful analytical tool for neurometabolic studies and disease biomarker detection.

Central to our approach was a \"sandwich\" assay, where MUC1 was anchored between aptamer-functionalized bimetallic core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) and magnetic nanobeads. The biosensor was applied to monitor MUC1 in serum samples through SERS signals from the reporter molecule 4-ATP, exhibiting a strong linear correlation across a wide dynamic range and the lower the limit of detection (LOD) of 2.96 fg/mL. To support clinical decision-making, the protocol was integrated with a machine learning (ML)model for the classification of SERS signal patterns, demonstrating performance metrics of 96% accuracy and 93.7% specificity when applied to diverse serum samples. This integration enabled robust, non-invasive preclinical screening that informs therapeutic regulation and patient monitoring long before clinical symptoms present. By establishing a scalable framework for continuous monitoring of MUC1 levels across large populations, our study offered a forward-thinking tool, namely, dual-aptamer-SERS biosensor, that may optimize individualized treatment planning and improve overall clinical management strategies."

A compact fluorescence detector for the MFS-PT was also fabricated using an LED and a micro-photomultiplier (μPMT). C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with the MFS-PT-ELISA using the MFS-PT and the fluorescence detector, and the limit of CRP detection (3σ) was estimated to be 0.78 ng/mL. The MFS-PT-ELISA was approximately 1.4 times more sensitive for the measurement of CRP than an ELISA using a PT without MFS. The measurement time and sample consumption were reduced, compared to conventional methods, to approximately 1/3 (55 min) and 1/33 (3 μL), respectively. Measurement of CRP in human serum based on the MFS-PT-ELISA method gave quantitative values that were generally consistent with those obtained by the conventional method using a micro-well plate. This result indicates that the developed method can be used for the measurement of actual samples. The MFS-PT can be fabricated easily and at low cost to enable rapid ELISA implementation with simple pipetting operations; therefore, it is expected to evolve as an on-site diagnostic tool that is applicable to a wide range of fields, including healthcare, environmental monitoring, and food safety."

The high-performance sensor film was prepared by the electropolymerization of an aniline monomer in the presence of chitosan polysaccharide and a CRP template on the Au-SPE surface. Key parameters, including the removal agent, scanning rate and the number of electropolymerization cycles, were systematically optimized. Optimal MIP performance, characterized by an enhanced electrochemical response upon recognition of the template molecules, was achieved using a scan rate of 50 mV/s and five electropolymerization cycles. The results demonstrated that this biocompatible biosensor platform exhibited exceptional selectivity and sensitivity, enabling the detection of CRP at concentrations ranging from 1 pg/mL to 10 ng/mL. The incorporation of chitosan into the MIP matrix represents a strategic advancement with significant potential for healthcare applications, owing to its inherent biocompatibility and well-documented benefits in tissue engineering.

The bioanalysis of payloads is challenging due to the need to measure trace amount amidst abundant ADC, with minor ADC degradation potentially causing substantial payload overestimation. Successful assays require careful evaluation of payload structures and effective management of ADC-related interferences. This study identifies challenges for lactone-containing free payloads, mitigates their impact on bioanalysis, and develops a validated methodology for accurate measurement of these payloads in human serum. Lactone hydrolysis and its formation from carboxylate were evaluated at various pH values in buffer solutions and serum. The lactone was completely hydrolyzed at pH 8.5 (25°C) within 25 min; it took several hours at pH 7 and was stable at pH ≤ 6. Lactone regeneration from carboxylate was rapid at pH 3 (within 5 min) and slower at pH ≥ 4. In human serum, lactone hydrolysis was relatively fast (approximately 2 h at 37°C), suggesting the carboxylate form predominates in circulation. Stability experiments showed lactone hydrolysis in serum is reversible, eliminating the need for sample treatment at clinical sites. These insights were applied in the design of a method based on protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction to quantify total payload exposure (50-10,000 pg/mL) in serum in the presence of ADC (250 µg/mL). A double liquid-liquid extraction was employed to purify the ADC before use to prevent interferences in the selectivity and stability assessment.

RCPM selectively targeted CDDP-resistant A549 (A549R) cells, efficiently accumulating within tumors. Exhibiting exceptional photothermal (PT) properties, RCPM facilitated PT-induced tumor ablation. Within the tumor microenvironment, RCPM underwent degradation, releasing high concentrations of V, Fe, and CDDP. The liberated V and Fe ions catalyzed the Fenton reaction, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducing ferroptosis. Simultaneously, these metal ions synergistically suppressed the expression of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC1), glutathione (GSH), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), effectively disrupting DNA repair pathways, preventing CDDP inactivation, and enhancing its cytotoxicity against A549R tumors. Furthermore, RCPM demonstrated complete and rapid renal clearance, ensuring excellent biosafety and strong clinical translational potential. In vivo studies revealed that a single administration of RCPM, combined with PT therapy, significantly inhibited NSCLC progression.

We reviewed VAERS reports on RSV vaccines, using the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) to identify safety signals. Our analysis incorporated severity, time-to-onset, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses to enhance key findings. After analyzing 5,147 RSVPreF3, 2,734 RSVpreF, and 35 mRNA-1345 reports, 91, 103, and 8 positive PT signals were found, respectively. Among serious reports, both RSVPreF3 and RSVpreF were associated with 9 important medical events (IMEs), including immune thrombocytopenia, which was also classified as a designated medical event (DME). Three pregnancy-related IME signals-hemorrhage in pregnancy, fetal death, and fetal hypokinesia - were reported for RSVpreF. Descriptive analysis of time-to-onset complemented the overall safety profiling, and sensitivity analysis offered further support for the observed disproportional reporting trends in certain adverse events (AEs). Our study utilized real-world data from large-scale spontaneous reporting systems to detect AEs that were disproportionately reported following RSV vaccination, thereby generating early safety signals to inform hypothesis development and support clinical awareness."

To address this gap, a user-friendly, dynamic online nomogram was developed to predict the incidence of positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with 3,641 patients with urinary stones at the Second Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. The cohort was split into training and validation sets. Key variables were identified using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, while Random Forest and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods were applied to assess their importance. Online nomograms were developed and evaluated for performance through metrics such as area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA), probability density function (PDF), and clinical utility curve (CUC).\n\nRESULTS: Multivariate logistic analysis identified four significant predictors-bacteria (BACT), C-reactive protein (CRP), nitrite, and leukocyte esterase (LEU)-which were integrated into the nomogram. The AUC values for the overall, training, and validation sets were 90.53, 91.22, and 89.06%, respectively. Calibration curves confirmed the nomogram's accuracy, and DCA demonstrated its superior performance over individual metrics. The PDF/CUC method revealed a threshold of 0.168, which effectively distinguished 88.54% of negatives from 78.70% of positives.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This dynamic online nomogram accurately predicts positive urine cultures in patients with urolithiasis, helping clinicians identify high-risk individuals , optimize antibiotic use, and improve patient outcomes. Further validation and biomarker exploration are needed to enhance its generalizability."

Differentially expressed FRGs linked to AKI were identified through analytical methods, followed by an examination of their biological functions. Diagnostic biomarkers were then selected using LASSO, RFE, and RF algorithms. Additionally, small pharmacological molecules associated with DE-FRGs were identified to explore the connection between DE-FRGs and AKI. qRT-PCR analysis revealed FAR1 expression in AKI, while Western blotting and IHC confirmed corresponding FAR1 protein changes in kidney tissues. TUNEL staining confirmed cell death in AKI. ROS production and ferroptosis markers were evaluated in FAR1-knockdown and FAR1-overexpressing HK-2 cells.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 106 DE-FRGs were identified, with functional enrichment analysis revealing strong associations with the MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways, as well as ferroptosis. Eight diagnostic biomarkers were selected using multiple algorithms, and their predictive accuracy was validated through ROC curve analysis. Furthermore, 13 pharmacological molecules were identified to establish a relationship between DE-FRGs and AKI.

Protein-based nanoparticle drug delivery systems (PNP-DDSs) have emerged as promising platforms to overcome limitations of conventional IBD therapies by improving drug stability and bioavailability while enabling colon-specific delivery. This review systematically classifies PNP-DDSs derived from natural proteins (albumin, gelatin, silk fibroin, and plant-derived proteins) and discusses their design principles along with strategies for intestinal targeting, including particle size and surface charge modulation, stimuli-responsive release (triggered by pH, reactive oxygen species, or enzymes), and active targeting. It highlights recent preclinical advances with oral PNP-DDSs delivering curcumin, resveratrol, 5-aminosalicylic acid, quercetin, and other anti-inflammatory agents, which demonstrate the therapeutic potential of these nanoplatforms in IBD models. Despite promising preclinical outcomes, clinical translation of PNP-DDSs remains challenging due to patient heterogeneity, manufacturing scale-up difficulties, and safety concerns. Future progress will require interdisciplinary innovation and optimization of multi‑stimuli-responsive designs for precise and safe clinical application of PNP-DDSs in IBD management."

The aim of this study is to investigate the economic impact associated with SI on healthcare costs and resource utilization among individuals with concomitant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Utilizing Danish national health registers, the study identifies patients with incident ASCVD and CKD from 2012 to 2022 based on diagnosis codes and laboratory results. SI is defined as CRP from 2 mg/L to 20 mg/L. The increased cost and use of healthcare services associated with SI is identified by comparing individuals with SI with individuals without SI. Statistical adjustments are made for age, sex, and comorbidities to control for confounding factors.\n\nRESULTS: Among patients with ASCVD and CKD, the presence of SI was significantly associated with higher healthcare interactions, with an average increase of 6.7 outpatient and 7.0 more inpatient contacts over the study period compared to those without SI. Furthermore, SI is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in healthcare expenditure, resulting in an excess cost of EUR 14,370 per patient over the first 3 years of the follow-up period.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The lack of a definitive onset date for SI complicates the analysis, as it is based on CRP tests conducted within 2 years of ASCVD and CKD diagnoses, potentially excluding individuals with prolonged SI prior to testing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SI is associated with higher healthcare resource utilization and costs among patients with ASCVD and CKD."

Collagen-based scaffolds offer significant promise for tissue engineering applications. This study presents a novel 5-layer collagen laminate engineered to facilitate both infection control and bone and tissue regeneration in open bone fractures. The laminate employs a layering strategy with rose bengal and green light-induced crosslinking to facilitate assembly while enabling the controlled release of three bioactive molecules, vancomycin, Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1α). Mechanical properties were evaluated using a high-capacity load cell, revealing that multi-layer configurations exhibited reduced stiffness and tensile strength compared to single-layer laminates. Notably, incubation with Normal Human Dermal Fibroblasts (NHDF) holds the potential to enhance interlayer cohesion and improve the mechanical integrity of 5-layer laminates. Furthermore, the composition of collagen within the laminate played a critical role in determining both mechanical behavior and release kinetics. Singular sheets of Endoform™ Natural (E) collagen displayed rapid release, while Geistlich Bio-Gide® (G) collagen sheets provided sustained release, reflecting their distinct structural characteristics. These findings underscore the potential of multi-layer collagen laminates as a versatile platform for tailored therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Clinical observational studies have demonstrated a high prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), indicating a significant comorbidity between the two conditions. This study applies transcriptome data to investigate shared molecular mechanisms underlying AF and OSA comorbidity and develops a robust diagnostic model to evaluate OSA risk in AF patients.\n\nMETHODS: Transcriptomic datasets for AF (GSE79768) and OSA (GSE135917) were retrieved from the the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with OSA and AF comorbidity were identified using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape, and hub genes were identified with the CytoHubba plug-in. A diagnostic model was then built based on these hub genes, and its performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in both the test and validation datasets. Immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using CIBERSORT.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 1,462 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified for the comorbidity of AF and OSA. Five hub genes were selected: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Immunoassay infiltration analysis revealed elevated levels of activated macrophages in both OSA and AF samples. The diagnostic model we developed demonstrated excellent predictive performance in the validation set.\n\nCONCLUSION: We identified five hub genes common to both OSA and AF: IFNG, IL4, IL15, CD19, and FASLG. Moreover, a diagnostic model based on these five hub genes can predict the risk of OSA in patients with AF."

Evidence shows that TTR contributes to neuroprotection, cognition, glucose regulation, pregnancy, muscle development, and bone mineralization. In several disease states, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementia, cerebrovascular disease, and osteoporosis, higher TTR levels may be protective. Numerous studies have shown that low levels of TTR are associated with increased mortality overall and in relation to cardiovascular disease and several malignancies.\n\nPURPOSE: There is a growing portfolio of approved and investigational transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) treatments that differ in their mechanisms and effects on circulating TTR. When selecting an ATTR therapy, clinicians must decide whether to stabilize and preserve TTR and its functions or knockdown and drastically reduce TTR. This review summarizes the vital physiologic roles of TTR in health and disease. We consider the potential effects on normal biologic pathways that may occur while therapeutically suppressing TTR and discuss clinical decisions concerning ATTR therapies in the context of the summarized literature.\n\nDISCUSSION: TTR is essential for a broad range of physiologic processes and may confer clinically protective effects in neurologic and other organ systems. While a link between low TTR and severe disease and mortality is well established, it remains unclear whether long-term TTR suppression\n\nCONCLUSION: TTR serves vital physiologic roles across organ systems. Given its clinically protective properties, continued investigation into the potential long-term impact of TTR suppression"

Subsequently, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed on DEMAGs. The PPI protein interaction network and machine learning were applied to identify Hub genes, which were also validated by GSE46474, an external validation set. We constructed a rat model of acute rejection of kidney transplantation and sequenced the transcriptome of the serum, and using the sequencing results, we analyzed the expression levels of the Hub gene. Then, a correlation analysis was carried out based on the Hub genes and different immune cell infiltration levels. Finally, GRNdb, miRDB, and GeneCards databases were applied to study the transcription factors, miRNAs, and regulatory drugs of Hub genes, respectively.\n\nRESULTS: The results of the Cibersort analysis revealed that M2-type macrophages were expressed higher in the Normal group. In addition, the results of the correlation analysis suggested that the expressions of Hub genes were negatively correlated with M1-type macrophages and positively correlated with M2-type macrophages.\n\nCONCLUSION: A diagnostic model of the macrophage-associated acute renal transplant rejection in peripheral blood was constructed based on CCR2 and TLR3, which can accurately diagnose the biological alterations of acute kidney transplant rejection.

In this study, we modelled infection with a highly pathogenic recombinant human A/Texas/37/2024 H5N1 (rHPh-TX H5N1) strain using human airway organoids (HAO) to investigate viral replication, innate immune response, infection-induced fibrogenesis, and potential therapeutic interventions. rHPh-TX H5N1 replicated efficiently in HAO, eliciting a robust interferon (IFN) response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Prolonged infection led to the accumulation of fibroblast-like cells surrounding infected regions, marked by increased alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression and upregulation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), indicative of fibroblast activation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling. Compared to organoids infected with the pandemic A/California/04/09 H1N1 (pH1N1) strain, rHPh-TX H5N1 induced significantly higher expression of fibrosis-associated markers, including fibronectin (FN), collagen 1A (COL1A), collagen 3A (COL3A), metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP2, and MMP9). Notably, the inhibition of Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinases (ROCK) signalling reduced fibrogenesis, with ROCK1 inhibition being more effective than ROCK2 inhibition. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ROCK signalling to mitigate H5N1-induced lung fibrosis, informing therapeutic strategies for severe influenza infections."

Participants were classified into two groups based on the timing of delivery: PE-delivery (delivery within 1 week of sample collection) and PE-non-delivery (no delivery within 1 week). Urine and serum samples were collected at the time of PE diagnosis, and cases were classified based on the presence of maternal or fetal complications.\n\nRESULTS: In total, 53 singleton pregnancies were analyzed and classified into the PE-delivery (n = 32) and PE-non-delivery groups (n = 21). No significant differences in L-FABP levels were observed between severe and non-severe PE cases. However, L-FABP levels were significantly higher in cases of severe PE due to maternal factors. In the PE-delivery group, urine and serum L-FABP levels were significantly elevated in cases requiring delivery within 1 week due to maternal indications compared to the PE-non-delivery group, whereas no such differences were found in cases with fetal indications. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed strong predictive performance of L-FABP levels for delivery within 1 week due to maternal deterioration, with areas under the curve of 0.892 (urine, cutoff: 12.3 μg/gCr) and 0.795 (serum, cutoff: 1.64 ng/mL).\n\nCONCLUSION: Maternal urine and serum L-FABP levels are closely associated with PE severity due to maternal complications and may serve as reliable biomarkers for imminent maternal deterioration."

    "text": "The human gut microbiome impacts host health through metabolite production, notably short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from digestion-resistant carbohydrates (DRCs). While DRC supplementation offers a means to modulate the microbiome therapeutically, its effectiveness is often limited by the microbial community's complexity and individual variability in microbiome functionality. We utilized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) from the AGORA collection to provide a system-level overview of the metabolic capabilities of human gut microbes in terms of carbohydrate trophic networks and propose improved therapeutic interventions, based on microbial community design. Our study inferred the capability of AGORA strains to consume carbohydrates of varying structural complexities - including DRCs - and to produce metabolites amenable to cross-feeding, such as SCFAs. The resulting functional database indicated that DRC-degrading abilities are rare among gut microbes, suggesting that the presence or absence of specific taxa can determine the success of DRC-based interventions. Additionally, we found that metabolite production profiles exceed family-level variation, highlighting the limitations in predicting intervention outcomes based on gut microbial composition assessed at higher taxonomic levels. In response to these findings, we integrate reverse ecology principles, network analysis and GEM community modeling to guide the design of minimal yet resilient microbial communities to better guarantee intervention response (purpose-based communities). As a proof of principle, we predicted a purpose-based community designed to enhance butyrate production when used in conjunction with DRC supplementation that displays resilience under nutritional stress, such as amino acid restriction. We further seeded the identified purpose-based community into modeled human microbiomes previously demonstrated to accurately predict SCFA production profiles. The analysis confirmed that such intervention significantly promotes butyrate production across samples, with those that presented a comparatively lower butyrate production pre-intervention displaying the largest increase in butyrate production after seeding. Our work highlights the potential of combining GEMs with community design to infer effective microbiome interventions, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes."

Measure the interventricular septum (IVS) thickness through cardiac ultrasound and evaluate the level of ANGPTL7 in umbilical cord blood using the ELISA method.\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of myocardial hypertrophy in the GDM group was 19.6%, significantly higher than 0% in the control group, and increased to 27.3% in neonates of mothers with GDM and poor glycaemic control. ANGPTL7 levels in the GDM group were significantly elevated compared to the control group (1.87 vs. 1.11 ng/mL). Furthermore, these levels were positively correlated with IVS thickness. In the poorly-controlled GDM subgroup (GDM-A), neonates had significantly higher ANGPTL7 levels and IVS/LVPW ratio (1.19 vs. 1.03), indicating more severe myocardial abnormalities.\n\nCONCLUSION: ANGPTL7 may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy in GDM neonates by promoting insulin resistance.

    "text": "Adynamic bone disorder, common in chronic kidney disease (CKD), results from reduced bone turnover, often due to medications such as calcimimetics or high-dose vitamin D analogs that induce low parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. Numerous factors contributing to PTH hyporesponsiveness, which also induces low bone turnover, include deficient PTH, uremic toxins like indoxyl sulfate, malnutrition, inflammation, and diabetes. Diagnosis typically involves bone biopsy, although it is inconvenient. Biomarkers like bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) and intact PTH (iPTH) show promise in distinguishing between low and high bone turnover. Meta-analysis suggests that levels of iPTH below 150 pg/mL or BALP levels below 20 μg/l indicate low bone turnover. Treatments aim to improve bone density without hindering repair, with osteo-anabolic medications being favored for low PTH levels and anti-resorptive agents being cautioned. Romosozumab, while effective, has safety concerns that limit its use. Uremic toxins are reduced by AST-120 treatment, which alleviates PTH hypo-responsiveness and bone toxicity. Adjunctive measures include addressing vitamin D deficiency, and diabetes, and utilizing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory therapies. Overall, BALP and iPTH appear as potential promising biomarkers for diagnosing and monitoring adynamic bone disorder in CKD, effectively guiding therapeutic interventions."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: There is still a lack of information regarding the impact of training on the domains that constitute quality of life (QoL), and the relationship between QoL with hormonal, inflammatory and pro-thermogenic/anti-inflammatory components. Thus, the present work aimed to evaluate the effects of combined training (CT) on the QoL of individuals with overweight-related type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to correlate (baseline values and CT-induced delta percentage changes (Δ%)) QoL variables with hormonal, inflammatory, and pro-thermogenic/anti-inflammatory components.\n\nMETHODS: Middle-aged individuals of both sexes and with overweight-related T2DM were assigned to either the control group (CONT group) or the combined training group (CTG). The CT consisted of strength training followed by aerobic training three times/week for 16 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention assessments included QoL perception, clinical variables, serum biochemical markers, and brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity.\n\nRESULTS: The CTG showed improvement in the perception of general QoL (20.0%) and in the physical (12.7%) and social (10.1%) domains. Significant positive correlations were observed between QoL variables with interleukin- 4 (IL-4), IL-10, IL-13, IL-33, Fibroblast growth factor- 21 (FGF-21), bone morphogenetic protein- 4 (BMP4), irisin, and BAT activity, alongside negative correlations with IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, c reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and incretin hormones at baseline and/or in the Δ% changes induced by training.\n\nCONCLUSION: CT improves the perception of general QoL and the physical and social domains of individuals with overweight-related T2DM. Baseline and in the Δ% of CT change, QoL components are related with several clinical, hormonal, inflammatory, and pro-thermogenic/anti-inflammatory markers, besides BAT increased activity."

The composite outcome was defined as all-cause mortality, sustained atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, plastic bronchitis, protein-losing enteropathy, or listing for transplantation. The EDP cutoff was determined using the lowest Brier score from Cox proportional hazard models.\n\nRESULTS: The study included 861 patients (mean age 16.4 ± 9.3 years). Mean EDP was 9.0 ± 3.5 mm Hg, with DD defined at an optimal EDP threshold >13 mm Hg. Patients were followed for a median of 3.6 years after catheterization. By univariable analysis patients with DD were more likely to have Fontan associated liver disease (40% vs 29%, P = .03) and kidney disease (19% vs 6%, P < .001). In multivariable analyses, DD was associated with the composite outcome (HR 3.37, 95% CI: 2.03-5.59, P < .001). Ninety-seven patients (11.3%) had DD. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that older age at catheterization, greater body mass index (BMI), nonleft ventricular morphology, and higher ventricular end-diastolic volume (EDV) were associated with DD.\n\nCONCLUSION: DD, defined as an EDP >13 mm Hg, is linked to over 3-fold higher risk of adverse outcomes. Risk factors for DD include older age, higher BMI, nonleft ventricular morphology, and larger EDV. The presence of risk factors may warrant screening catheterization to identify DD and modify care accordingly."

However, it remains unclear whether Ses exerts a protective effect against APAP-induced kidney injury.\n\nMETHODS: In vivo, C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with Ses and injected intraperitoneally with APAP. In vitro, human kidney proximal tubule cells 2 were pretreated with Ses, and then models of kidney injury induced by APAP were established. Kidney damage was evaluated by morphological, inflammation, oxidative stress and protein analyzes.\n\nRESULTS: Ses significantly improved APAP-induced nephrotoxicity in vitro and in vivo models. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were enriched in ferroptosis and apoptosis signaling pathways, identifying heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) as a core protein. In the Ses-treated group, ferroptosis and apoptosis were significantly inhibited, while HMOX1 was effectively restored. In cell experiments, both the HMOX1 agonist hemin and Ses attenuated ferroptosis and apoptosis. HMOX1 inhibitor Zinc Protoporphyrin significantly eliminated the protective effect of Ses.\n\nCONCLUSION: Ses alleviates APAP-induced renal injury by mediating the inhibition of ferroptosis and apoptosis via HMOX1. This study provides a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of drug-induced renal injury."

    "text": "Skin ageing is a natural process that occurs in living beings characterized by a decline in the function of tissues and cells, which over time will become apparent through different processes or pathways in various organs, tissues, and cells. Living organisms undergo the ageing process simultaneously with their growth and development, characterized by constant cell division that leads to a decrease in the telomeric region of the chromosome. An active telomerase enzyme that adds a sequence of nucleotides to telomeres can keep them from shortening. The telomerase enzyme, on the other hand, is generally not active in skin cells due to constrained regulation. Research has demonstrated that anti-ageing drugs under development can activate the telomerase enzyme. The study used a computer-based method to examine how well patchouli plant parts could work as telomerase enzyme activators in cells' metabolic pathways. This research uses an in silico approach with three primary methods: network pharmacology, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations. According to the network pharmacology study, the compounds found in the patchouli plant parts can turn on the telomerase enzyme through the PI3K-Akt pathway. Compounds in the patchouli plant activate the AKT1, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1 proteins. These proteins are part of the telomerase enzyme activation pathway. Furthermore, molecular docking and molecular dynamics analyses show that patchouli plant compounds bind well to each protein, implying that the patchouli plant can activate telomerase. Both in vitro and in vivo tests are required to verify these findings."

    "text": "Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are often designed to not only bind targets via their antigen-binding domains (Fabs) but to also engage with cell surface receptors, FcγRs and FcRn, through their Fc regions, which may result in a variety of functional outcomes, including antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and alteration of circulating half-lives. Engineering the Fc regions to achieve desirable pharmacology and pharmacokinetics is a widely adopted strategy in drug development. Fc regions can be modified through amino acid substitutions and glycoengineering, resulting in enhanced or reduced effector functions, preferential binding to FcR subtypes, or pH-dependent binding to FcRns. These alterations in binding and effector activities of mAbs may potentially also be accompanied by undesirable effects or safety concerns. Critical assessment of pharmacology and safety in the nonclinical setting is essential before exposing humans to the engineered mAb. For Fc-modified mAbs, the choice of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical pharmacology and safety models need to account for species differences in FcR expression and function, potentially divergent effects of Fc modifications in humans versus nonclinical species, impact of target and cognate ligand expression patterns, and potential impact of emergent anti-drug antibodies directed against the mAb. Using a variety of industry case studies, we highlight key aspects of nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology testing strategies, factors that influence choice of nonclinical models, translatability of findings, input from health authorities and suggest best practice approaches for nonclinical testing of Fc modified mAbs."

This study explores the non-linear relationship between the metabolic equivalent of recreational physical activity (MET-RPA), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and depressive symptoms, assessing hs-CRP's mediating role.\n\nMETHODS: Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2013 to 2020 were used, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores, hs-CRP, and PA data. Restricted cubic spline models analyzed non-linear relationships, and mediation analysis assessed the mediating role of hs-CRP.\n\nRESULTS: MET-RPA exhibited a non-linear \"U\" shaped relationship with depressive symptoms, where increased MET-RPA initially reduced depressive symptoms risk until a lowest point (3072.96 MET-min/week; i.e., 375 min of vigorous exercise or 750 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week), beyond which the risk increased. A non-linear \"L\" shaped relationship was observed between MET-RPA and CRP, with a lowest point of 3888.24 MET-min/week. Furthermore, a significant inflexion point was identified at a CRP level of 9.85 mg/L, where depressive symptoms risk increased with rising CRP levels but at a slower rate beyond this point. Mediation analysis revealed that CRP significantly mediated the relationship between MET-RPA and depressive symptoms, accounting for 8.14 % of the total effect.\n\nCONCLUSION: Moderate levels of RPA significantly reduce depressive symptoms, while excessive RPA slightly increases the risk of depression. The anti-inflammatory effect of exercise, represented by decreased hs-CRP levels, plays a partial but significant mediating role in the relationship between RPA and depression."

The present study aimed to determine the gene expression profiles of the cytochrome 450 3 A family of genes, CYP2C8, multidrug resistance 1 and glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), through the comparisons of patients with steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS), using the prediction of miRNAs as a prognostic biomarker. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to identify gene expression patterns in each group, and the Gene Expression Omnibus database was used to predict groups of genes with co-expression patterns. Moreover, a network-based interaction analysis was performed using Human Protein Atlas and STRING databases, to identify the specific gene group involved in NS. MiRDB was also used to determine the specific miRNA associated with the aforementioned gene groups. Results of the present study demonstrated that male patients were more susceptible to NS development. Moreover, in both males and females in the SRNS group, NR3C1, CYP2C8, CYP3A7, CYP3A5 and CYP3A4(statistically insignificant) were upregulated. In addition, results of the present study revealed 10 unique hub miRNAs in the SRNS group that exhibited potential as gene targets for above genes. Collectively, results of the present study may provide novel insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying NS development, which may aid in the development of personalized therapeutic strategies."

Existing models exhibit limitations in accurately predicting tumor drug resistance and identifying resistance-associated genes. Furthermore, they often fail to effectively integrate multidimensional omics data and pathway-level information, lacking biological interpretability.\n\nMETHODS: We propose GC-PGE (Gene Correlation and Pathway Graph Encoder Network), a novel deep learning model to predict tumor drug resistance and identify core resistance genes. First, leveraging graph neural network, we constructed a gene correlation network incorporating protein interactions, gene homology, and signaling pathway data. We then integrated the tasks of drug-resistant gene prediction and tumor sample classification into a unified network architecture using a Bayesian learning approach, enabling mutual validation and enhancement between the tasks. Additionally, we developed a pathway graph encoder. This module employed graph structure to encode gene feature weights, simultaneously classifying tumor sample drug resistance and extracting core resistance genes along with their characteristic pathways.\n\nRESULT: GC-PGE significantly outperformed traditional models including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), Random forest (RF), and naive Bayes model (NBM) in predicting tumor drug resistance. It also demonstrated superior performance over baseline models including differential expression (DE), mutual information (MI), and random forest (RF) in identifying resistance-associated genes. Furthermore, GC-PGE elucidated key signaling pathways and core resistance genes associated with drug resistance in liver cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma, providing valuable mechanistic insights.\n\nCONCLUSION: By integrating multidimensional biological data and signaling pathway information, GC-PGE provides an effective framework for predicting tumor drug resistance and pinpointing core resistance genes. The model not only enhances prediction accuracy but also improves interpretability, thus positioning it as a promising approach for advancing personalized cancer therapy and novel therapeutic target discovery."

In this study, the assessment of a unique purification mode, protein L affinity chromatography, for purification of a bsAb resulted in high levels of free light chain (LC) in the final product. It was discovered that the free LC formed oligomers of various sizes upon accelerated stress in a concentration-, time-, and temperature-dependent manner. This is the first time free LC oligomer has been reported as a product-related impurity.

This study aims to compare the performance of two widely used Ki-67 antibody clones, MIB1 and SP6, and to evaluate their impact on molecular subtyping in breast cancer. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy samples from 35 primary breast carcinoma cases were stained using MIB1 and SP6 antibodies. Histological tumor characteristics and receptor statuses were evaluated for each case. The Ki-67 proliferative index was assessed following the latest recommendations of the International Ki-67 in Breast Cancer Working Group. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation, paired t-test, Welch's ANOVA, and McNemar's test. A strong correlation was observed between Ki-67 indices obtained using MIB1 and SP6 (r = 0.755, p < 0.001), with no statistically significant difference in mean values (p = 0.288). Ki-67 index correlated significantly with tumor grade for both antibodies. Among Luminal HER2-negative tumors, 17 % showed discordant molecular subtyping between MIB1 and SP6 using a 20 % cut-off. Similar discrepancies were observed at 14 % and 25 % cut-offs, suggesting that antibody choice may affect subtype classification. In conclusion, both MIB1 and SP6 provide reliable assessment of proliferative index in breast carcinoma, however, discrepancies in individual cases may impact molecular subtyping and subsequent clinical decision-making. Therefore, reporting the antibody clone used in Ki-67 evaluation may be advisable, pending further validation."

DNA damage repair (DDR) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. The aim of this study was to identify core DDR genes involved in IFP progression and to assess their diagnostic potential and immunological relevance.\n\nMETHODS: Utilizing Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and previous research, we obtained publicly available IPF disease data and DDR gene set data. Through WGCNA, LASSO, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, we identified DDR-related hub genes, which were subsequently validated using external validation sets. ROC analysis was employed to assess and identify IPF diagnostic markers. Immune microenvironment of IPF group and its correlation with diagnostic genes were evaluated by ssGSEA algorithm and Spearman correlation analysis. Potential miRNAs and functional genes regulating diagnostic genes were predicted utilizing Network Analyst and GeneMANIA platforms.\n\nRESULTS: We identified HMGB2 and PRPF19 as diagnostic markers for IPF, both of which exhibited excellent diagnostic performance across three datasets. Comparisons at both single-cell and transcriptome levels revealed that HMGB2 was overexpressed in IPF, while PRPF19 was underexpressed. Immune microenvironment assessments indicated high infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in IPF group, suggesting presence of an inflammatory fibrotic immune microenvironment. Correlation analysis showed that various immune cells in IPF immune microenvironment were significantly associated with HMGB2 and PRPF19, indicating that these genes may influence immune microenvironment.\n\nCONCLUSION: By combining WGCNA and LASSO analyses, this study identified two hub genes, HMGB2 and PRPF19, that can serve as diagnostic markers for IPF and modulate its immune microenvironment. This finding provides new directions for clinical diagnosis of IPF and research into DDR-related mechanisms."

Bispecific antibodies (bsAb) that bind to transmembrane protein expressed at the BBB, such as the transferrin receptor (TfR), have shown enhanced brain exposure in rodents and non-human primate (NHP) due to receptor-mediated transcytosis. However, it remains unclear how preclinical findings translate to humans. Moreover, optimal TfR binding affinity remains a subject of debate. Model-informed drug discovery and development is a powerful approach that has been successfully used to support research and development. The goal of this analysis was to expand a published brain minimal physiologically based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to investigate the optimal TfR binding affinity for maximal brain delivery in NHP and to facilitate prediction of the PK of anti-TfR bsAbs in humans from NHP data. Literature data for plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain exposure after administration of non-TfR mAbs and monovalent bsAbs with respect to TfR in NHP were used to develop the TfR mPBPK model. Clinical validation using human PK data from plasma and CSF for the monovalent anti-TfR bsAb trontinemab demonstrated good predictive performance without major model recalibration. The availability of the TfR mPBPK model is envisaged to provide better understanding of the relationship between TfR binding affinity, dose, and brain exposure, which would lead to more robust selection of lead candidates and efficacious dosing regimens."

    "text": "OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to investigate the associations of single and mixed exposure to the environmental pollutants per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) with renal function and mortality in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients.\n\nMETHODS: Non-dialysis CKD1-4 stage patients in the 2003-2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who were ≥20 years old were included. Five PFAS were measured and all patients were followed up till 31 December 2019. Multivariate linear, logistic, and Cox regressions were used to evaluate the associations between PFAS exposure and renal function, mortality. Stratified subgroups were analyzed based on baseline characteristics. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) was used in sensitivity analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Among 1503 CKD patients included, baseline renal function declined in 701 patients (44.4%) and 462 patients (24.9%) died during the follow-up. Single exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) was positively associated with renal function decline (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: PFAS single and mixed exposure were closely related to renal function and renal progression in adult CKD patients. There was no statistically significant association between PFAS exposure and mortality."

We aimed to explore the causal effects of serum metabolites on graft dysfunction and the mediating role of inflammatory proteins.\n\nMETHODS: We first analyzed the causal association of 1,091 serum metabolites and 91 inflammatory proteins with graft dysfunction by Mendelian randomization (MR) to find the most important indicators and calculated the mediating role of inflammatory proteins. Second, we further intergrated the single-cell analysis, machine learning, and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods to validate the role of the inflammatory protein in rejected transplanted kidneys.\n\nRESULTS: In MR analysis, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method showed that N-acetylaspartyl glutamate (NAAG) levels reduced the risk of graft dysfunction (OR 0.648, 95% CI 0.522-0.805). Interleukin-2 receptor subunit beta (IL-2RB) mediated the association between NAAG and graft dysfunction with a mediation ratio of 11.35% (95% CI 1.85%-24.69%). In transplanted kidneys, IL-2RB is predominantly expressed elevated in T cells from rejection samples and is associated with decreased renal function. 10 hub genes were identified based on T cells with high and low expression of IL-2RB, of which NGboost reached AUC 0.77. The SHAP method obtained the gene with the greatest model contribution: the IL-2RB gene.\n\nCONCLUSION: NAAG plays a protective role in graft dysfunction, and part of the effect is mediated by inhibition of IL-2RB, which is verified as an important gene that functions in transplant kidney rejection. NAAG and IL-2RB may be novel molecular markers and therapeutic targets for graft dysfunction."

Microcephaly, hydrocephalus, ocular deformations, and meningoencephalitis characterize this disease. The plaque assay is the gold standard used in scientific research laboratories to quantify the virus titer on a sample and assess their relationship with the infectious dosage. However, it requires costly infrastructure and specialized technical training. In this study, a nano-immunosensor based on gold nanoparticles was developed to detect Zika virus using FTIR spectroscopy. Three calibration curves were established to estimate ZIKV titers by measuring the intensity of absorption bands associated with functional groups in viral samples at different concentrations. The detection sensitivity ranged from 5 × 10⁴ to 5 × 10⁷ PFU/mL for the lipid group (CO, 1750 cm⁻¹), 5 × 10 ³ to 5 × 10⁷ PFU/mL for the protein group (amide I, 1680 cm⁻¹), and 5 × 10⁵ to 2.2 × 10⁸ PFU/mL for the carbohydrate group (C-O, 860 cm⁻¹).

We aim to explore the potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of TLS in IgA nephropathy by bioinformatics methods, hoping to provide treatment methods. The datasets GSE226840, GSE237120, and GSE116626 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were employed to investigate the potential therapeutic targets of TLS in IgAN. The R was used to obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of three datasets, and the Venny was used to intersect the above three parts of the DEGs to obtain the common DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed on obtained genes using Metascape. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The intersection of the above common differential genes and IgAN differential genes was obtained by Venny tool. The Nephroseq platform was used to screen core genes and explore their relationship with clinical features. Meanwhile, CIBERSORT was utilized to further delve into the correlation between core genes and immune cells. 92 TLS-related genes and 486 IgAN related genes were obtained, and 6 common genes were obtained after crossing the two genes. The intersection genes were verified by Nephroseq, and CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6, and CD48 were identified as core genes. At the same time, there were differences in the composition of immune cells between the disease group and the control group when the immune infiltration analysis was performed. And by further analyzing the correlation between core genes and immune cells, the study found that the four genes were positively correlated with T cells, B cells, plasma cells, and other immune cells. By exploring the relationship between core genes and clinical features, CDKN1A and DUSP6 were negatively correlated with Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) and positively correlated with proteinuria in IgAN patients. CD48 was negatively correlated with GFR and positively correlated with Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN). The four genes highly associated with TLS and IgAN were screened using GEO database in study. And CDKN1A, CD83, DUSP6 and CD48 may provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of TLS in IgAN. At the same time, studies have found that T cells, B cells, and macrophages may be involved in the formation of TLS in IgAN."

However, this approach may compromise chirality-dependent therapeutic efficacy and potentially underestimate the significance of chirality in nanomedicine. Herein, supramolecular chiral nanoparticles, D/L-arginine (Arg)-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl) porphine (TCPP), were constructed through the self-assembly of D/L-Arg and TCPP. Owing to the interaction between D/L-Arg and TCPP, chirality transfer from D/L-Arg to TCPP was observed, which resulted in the direct chiral induction of TCPP within supramolecular assemblies. Furthermore, driven by enantioselective interaction with proteins, D-Arg-TCPP demonstrated 1.5-fold greater cellular uptake efficiency than L-Arg-TCPP via caveolin-dependent endocytosis. Thus, the enantiomer-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating capacity-induced photodynamic anti-tumor performance, with D-Arg-TCPP exhibiting 1.9 times higher efficacy than L-Arg-TCPP, was verified. Our findings not only elucidate the mechanisms underlying chirality-dependent behavior of porphyrin-based supramolecular assemblies, but also pave a new avenue for optimizing chirality-mediated cancer therapy."

This study aimed to developa nomogram for predicting recurrence in patients with high-risk GISTand to provide guidance for adjuvant therapy.\n\nMETHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 971 patients with high-risk GIST who underwent genetic testingat 13 centers in China. A nomogram was constructed in the training cohort and validated in the validation cohort.\n\nRSEULTS: The training and validation cohorts included 696 and 275 patients, respectively. The nomogram incorporated blood plateletlevels, total protein, tumor location, tumor size, mitotic count, tumor rupture, Ki-67 index, and gene mutations. The C-index and AUC were 0.758 and 0.781 in the training cohort and 0.841 and 0.755, respectively, in the validation cohort. Calibration and DCA curves confirmed favorable discrimination, calibration accuracy, and clinical benefits. Using the nomogram, patients were categorized into a general high-risk groupand a very high-risk group. Among the general high-risk group, no significant difference in RFS was observed between patients who received adjuvant imatinib for 2.5 years or longer. Conversely, in the very high-risk group, patients receiving adjuvant imatinib for five or more years had markedly improved RFS.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on the largest nomogram-related multicenter study in high-risk GIST, the nomogram accurately predicted RFS in patients with high-risk GIST and provided guidance on adjuvant therapy for the first time. For general high-risk patients, 3 years of adjuvant imatinib is adequate, whereas very high-risk patients benefit significantly from more than 5 years of adjuvant imatinib."

At the same time, long-term food supply statistics from the FAOSTAT database show that these recommendations were at the root of fundamental dietary changes in Western countries, which resulted in a lower consumption of eggs and red meat, a higher consumption of cereals and poultry, a decline in average protein quality and, overall, in a higher glycemic load of the diet. Because current views on human nutrition are based primarily on highly unreliable questionnaire data from observational studies, the purpose of this commentary is to provide an alternative ecological (country-level) perspective and to trace the consequences of these nutritional changes using the FAOSTAT database in combination with available anthropological and health statistics. This comparison shows a close connection between the decline in protein quality and the sudden reversal of the positive height trend in some Western countries, after ∼150 years of continuous growth, which points to suboptimal levels of child nutrition. The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes is strongly correlated with the increasing consumption of high-glycemic carbohydrates and sweeteners, and is also interconnected with the decrease in body height, because a high-quality, growth-stimulating diet during adolescence is inversely related to obesity. Given the long-term association between height and phenotypic IQ, the lower quality of nutrients in children's diet may also seriously affect intellectual potential and future civilizational development. In light of these findings, current nutritional strategies should be seriously reconsidered and recommended protein intakes for children must be urgently reevaluated."

Using the Ancestral and BA.5 SARS-CoV-2 strains as model systems, we developed the Q-NAb IgG Test for the quantitative determination of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants, traceable to WHO International Standards. The test utilizes a novel Fusion Protein that mimics the Spike receptor binding domain docked to the human ACE2 protein and effectively blocks non-neutralizing antibodies in the sample. After pre-blocking samples with Fusion Protein, direct binding of the residual neutralizing antibodies to variant RBDs coated in the wells of the microtiter plate is measured with a fluorescent secondary antibody. Results of the Q-NAb IgG Test agree with a live-virus microneutralization assay for both the Ancestral strain (WA1-2020) and the Omicron BA.5 (COR-22-063113/2022) variant (Spearman's correlation, ρ = 0.87 and 0.92, respectively). The analytical performance (sensitivity, linearity, precision, and interference) of the Q-NAb IgG Test was established along with specificity using a panel of monoclonal neutralizing and non-neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Clinical sensitivity and specificity using pre-pandemic, convalescent, and vaccinated serum and plasma samples is also reported. The advantages of the Q-NAb IgG Test are its strong correlation to live virus neutralization tests, traceability to WHO International Standards, convenient microtiter plate format, low sample volume requirements, and suitability for a BSL-2 laboratory."

    "text": "The global emergence of multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies targeting essential metabolic pathways. This study employs an integrated computational approach to identify inhibitors of IrtAB, a critical iron transporter in Mtb, leveraging structure-based drug design to overcome existing resistance mechanisms. Virtual screening of 201,544 compounds from the ZINC20 database was performed using defined drug-likeness criteria (MW 300-350 Da, LogP 1-3.5, neutral charge at pH 7.4), followed by molecular docking. Three lead compounds demonstrated high-affinity binding to IrtAB's histidine-rich substrate pocket (His356/402/407): ZINC000225478236 (DPTU, -8.55 kcal/mol), featuring a triazole-urea scaffold; ZINC000038021820 (DMPA-HCl, -8.18 kcal/mol), with optimized morpholine-propylamino acid pharmacophores; and ZINC000004689680 (TMSPI, -8.16 kcal/mol), a spirocyclic indole derivative. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of top candidates revealed significant correlations between binding affinity (S) and molecular descriptors (R²=0.819 for PCA1). Molecular dynamics simulations (50 ns, OPLS3e force field) confirmed complex stability, with DMPA-HCl showing superior rigidity (RMSD <0.8 Å). Comprehensive ADMET profiling using SwissADME and ProTox-3.0 predicted favorable pharmacokinetics (Lipinski compliance, high GI absorption) and low toxicity risks for DMPA-HCl (hepatotoxicity probability=0.61). While these computational results identify promising IrtAB inhibitors, key limitations include the relatively short duration of MD simulations (50 ns), which may not fully capture long-term protein-ligand interaction dynamics, and the lack of experimental validation to confirm the biological efficacy and safety of the candidate compounds. This work establishes a rational foundation for developing novel antitubercular agents targeting iron acquisition, with DMPA-HCl emerging as the prime candidate for further optimization."

However, the dynamics of A1M in chronic kidney disease patients being susceptible to oxidative stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the profile and changes in A1M resulting from blood purification in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) (including hemodiafiltration). Eighteen patients on stable maintenance HD were included in the study. For analysis, residual serum samples were collected from these patients during routine blood tests. A1M was measured using a latex agglutination immunoassay. The abundance of the free and bound forms of A1M was determined by native PAGE. The A1M concentration was 91.58 ± 26.34 mg/L, the percentage of free A1M was 72.62 ± 20.02%. The pre- and postdialysis mean concentration of free A1M were 68.74 ± 29.78 and 52.13 ± 22.48 mg/L, respectively. The mean reduction rate in free A1M after blood purification treatment was 20.49 ± 20.91%, showing the significant difference between pre- and postdialysis concentrations. The predialysis mean concentration of protein-bound A1M was 22.85 ± 15.16 mg/L, with a postdialysis concentration of 24.73 ± 12.82 mg/L.

These drinks typically contain a variety of components, each of which has been shown to offer individual benefits. However, the combined effects of these components, as formulated in many sports drinks, have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aims to evaluate the impact of typical sports drink components on endurance performance, perceived exertion, and carbohydrate and fat metabolism, using a sequential additive design.\n\nMETHODS: Twelve healthy, trained endurance athletes aged 20 to 35 years participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study involved a baseline assessment and four exercise protocols, each separated by a 7-day washout period. During each exercise protocol, participants cycled for 40 minutes at 80% of their previously determined peak oxygen uptake , followed by an incremental protocol performed to voluntary exhaustion. Participants were randomly assigned to ingest one of four 300 ml solutions 60 and 30 minutes before each exercise protocol: solution A (placebo mineral water), solution B (dextrose and sodium), solution C (solution B + beetroot extract), or solution D (solution C + arginine and L-citrulline). Ventilation and heart rate were continuously monitored before and throughout the exercise. Lactate and glucose levels were measured at specific time points before and during the exercise, while ratings of perceived exertion were recorded every 10 minutes. Power output was continuously tracked throughout the exercise protocol. Body weight was assessed both before and after each exercise session.\n\nRESULTS: There were no significant differences between the four solutions in terms of time to exhaustion (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The effect of the tested sports drink compositions on performance during the selected exercise protocol to voluntary exhaustion appears minimal. This study found no significant differences between the solutions and the placebo. Thus, it can be concluded that consuming a dextrose-based solution before exercise did not offer any performance advantage over water. The additional substances included in solutions B, C, and D did not influence performance, carbohydrate metabolism, or fat metabolism during the exercise."

While apelin peptides are promising therapeutic candidates due to their critical role in vascular homeostasis, their efficacy as agonists is limited by insufficient lesion-specific targeting and suboptimal in vivo stability. Here, we developed an engineered extracellular vesicle (EV) platform for precise apelin delivery to PAH lesions, maximizing therapeutic impact. Using interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3), a type II transmembrane protein, we oriented the apelin peptide on the EV surface with its C-terminus fully exposed, preserving the critical binding interface for functional interaction with the apelin receptor. To further enhance targeting specificity, we integrated the PAH-targeting peptide CARSKNKDC (CAR), which selectively binds to heparan sulfate overexpressed on PAH endothelial cells, into the IFITM3-apelin scaffold, creating CAR-Apelin EVs. This dual-engineered EVs demonstrated exceptional targeting and therapeutic efficacy in PAH models. CAR-Apelin EVs significantly reversed pathological vascular remodeling and improved cardiac function, as evidenced by reduced right ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy. Our findings establish CAR-Apelin EVs as a transformative therapeutic strategy, providing a targeted and effective approach to meet critical unmet needs in PAH treatment."

Nevertheless, its role in the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) remains to be elucidated.\n\nMETHODS: We identified the differentially expressed genes in the glomeruli of IgAN patients through weighted gene co-expression network analysis across three datasets. Through clinical renal pathological tissue and cellular experiments, we further validated the gene and investigated its relationship with the inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to peritumoral normal tissues, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) signaling pathway have been identified as key elements in IgAN pathogenesis from two GEO databases and a validation dataset. PCK1 was identified and validated as one of the most promising candidate genes. The expression of PCK1 in clinically collected kidney specimens was significantly downregulated in patients with IgAN compared to healthy controls. The expression of PCK1 was inversely correlated with clinical indicators such as urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 24-hour proteinuria. In experiments with SV40-transformed mouse glomerular mesangial cells (MCs), PCK1 and PPARγ protein expression levels were significantly decreased in polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1)-stimulated MCs, which contrasts with the increased expression of inflammatory and fibrotic factors. Overexpression of PCK1 inhibited cellular inflammation and fibrotic changes induced by pIgA1, demonstrating protective effects against cellular fibrosis similar to rosiglitazone.\n\nCONCLUSION: PCK1 exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on mesangial cell inflammatory markers and fibrosis indicators in IgAN, potentially offering a novel therapeutic target for its treatment."

Gliadin, a component of gluten, triggers oxidative stress in celiac disease. Using sensitive analytical methods, especially in foods containing high amounts of these proteins, is crucial for food safety. Aptamer-based biosensors are widely preferred in electroanalytical methods. One of the promising approaches regarding biosensors is the studies in which aptamer-based sensors are combined with molecularly imprinted polymers. The antibody-like binding and ability of MIP to distinguish between molecules increases the method's selectivity. Using a platform modified with aptamer and molecularly imprinted polymer hybrid (MIP) as a new synthetic receptor film, this study presents a selective and sensitive label-free aptasensor for detecting a food allergy gliadin. For this purpose, screen printed gold electrode was used. The electrode surface was electrochemically coated with gold nanoparticles to bind the aptamer to the surface; then the aptamer-gliadin complex was dripped onto the surface and adhered to it, then, o-phenylene diamine monomer was used to synthesize a MIP surface. Gliadin was determined by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in a wide range from 0.25 fg/mL to 1000 pg/mL. The developed method calculated LOD for gliadin determination as 0.011 fg/mL and LOQ as 0.034 fg/mL. The devised aptasensor was not only capable to the discrimination of the commonly found allergen compounds such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein, and ara-H1, but also it could detect the gliadin in spiked real samples such as gluten-free bread, crackers, cookies and brown rice cakes samples in the high recovery range of 98.1-104.6 %.

Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 17.0, with effect sizes expressed as weighted mean differences (WMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nRESULTS: A total of 18 RCTs involving 1,497 patients were analyzed. Combination therapy significantly improved total effective rate (TER) (MD 2.61, 95% CI 1.62-2.64) and reduced key renal and metabolic markers. Urinary protein excretion rate (UPER), serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 24-hour urinary protein (24h-UTP), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels all significantly decreased in the combination group. Subgroup analysis showed that patients aged ≤55 years had greater reductions in SCr (WMD -25.62, 95% CI -29.41 to -21.83) and BUN (WMD -2.51, 95% CI -2.75 to -2.27). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of findings. No publication bias was detected for TER, SCr, BUN, 24h-UTP, TG, and adverse reactions, though UPER and TC showed potential bias.\n\nCONCLUSION: SKI combined with RAAS blockers may enhance renal function and metabolic profiles in DN patients.

The biosensor demonstrated exceptional sensitivity and specificity to KIM1 protein, and the KIM-1-functionalized sensor significantly surpassed the control sensors with optimal responses in both artificial and abnormal urine samples. The response of the SDI biosensor to KIM-1 in clinical samples showed a linear range from 10 aM to 1 nM, covering concentrations between 1 aM and 100 nM. The lowest limit of detection is 13.6 aM with an exceptional accuracy. Clinical testing confirmed the biosensor's high selectivity, sensitivity, and stability, positioning it as a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool for early detection and monitoring of kidney diseases."

In vivo, renal function was assessed via serum creatinine, urea nitrogen, and creatinine clearance measurements, alongside histopathological evaluation of renal fibrosis and inflammation. In vitro, hypoxia-treated HK-2 cells were analyzed for fibrotic markers (fibronectin, collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18). Molecular mechanisms were probed through protein expression analysis of HIF-1α and the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, with NLRP3 inflammasome activity evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: SSR treatment significantly improved renal function in CRF rats, reducing serum creatinine (Scr) and urea nitrogen (BUN) while enhancing creatinine clearance. Histopathology revealed preserved renal architecture with attenuated fibrosis and inflammatory infiltration. In hypoxic HK-2 cells, SSR downregulated fibrotic markers and suppressed IL-1β and IL-18 levels. Mechanistically, SSR reduced HIF-1α expression, inhibited TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling, and suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both models.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SSR alleviates renal fibrosis and CKD progression by mitigating hypoxia-driven inflammation and blocking the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB/NLRP3 pathway."

In this study, we developed a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 NP-RNA interaction. Using this HTRF-based approach, we identified two natural products, sennoside A and sennoside B, as effective blockers of this interaction. Bio-layer interferometry assays confirmed that both sennosides directly bind to the NP, with binding sites located within the C-terminal domain. Additionally, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments revealed that sennoside B significantly inhibited RNA-induced LLPS of the NP, while sennoside A displayed comparatively weaker activity. Thus, the developed HTRF-based assay is a valuable tool for identifying novel compounds that disrupt the RNA-binding activity and LLPS of the SARS-CoV-2 NP. Our findings may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 NP."

The participants were randomly divided into a training set (711 people) and a validation set (305 people) at a ratio of 7:3. A risk prediction model was established according to the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis. The performance of the model was evaluated with the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration curve analysis, the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) test and decision curve analysis (DCA).\n\nRESULTS: The incidence of autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis in patients on maintenance hemodialysis was 32%. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), catheterization history, hemodialysis duration, autologous arteriovenous fistula stenosis and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were independent risk factors for autologous arteriovenous fistula thrombosis. These five predictors were used to construct a predictive nomogram. The AUC was 0.818 in the training set and 0.826 in the validation set. The calibration curve of the nomogram was close to the standard curve, indicating that the model was well calibrated. The DCA results confirmed that the model provided good net clinical benefits.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, a predictive nomogram for arteriovenous fistula thrombosis was established and validated."

Data on demographics, disease history, menstrual and reproductive history was collected. The case group patients were sampled immediately upon presenting with pregnancy loss at their first visit. The reference group patients underwent samples when they chose to participate voluntarily. All vaginal discharge was performed DNA Preparation and Metagenomics Sequencing. DNA extraction was performed using the phenol/trichloromethane method and the DNA fragments were then size-selected to 300-700 bp using magnetic beads. The selected fragments were repaired and ligated with indexed adaptors. The captured DNA was amplified again by PCR and circularized to create a single-stranded circular (ssCir) library. The ssCir library was subsequently amplified through rolling circle amplification (RCA) to produce DNA nanoballs (DNBs). The DNBs were then loaded onto a flow cell and sequenced using the DNBSEQ Platform. Nonparametric tests, including Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests, were employed.

Despite advancements in cancer therapies, challenges such as cellular toxicity and drug resistance to chemotherapy persist. Regulated cell death (RCD), once regarded as a passive process, is now recognized as a programmed mechanism with distinct biochemical and morphological characteristics, thereby presenting new therapeutic opportunities. Ferroptosis, a novel form of RCD characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and unique mitochondrial damage, differs from apoptosis, autophagy, and necroptosis. It is driven by reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lipid peroxidation and is implicated in tumorigenesis, anti-tumor immunity, and resistance, particularly in tumors undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ferroptosis is associated with ischemic organ damage, degenerative diseases, and aging, regulated by various cellular metabolic processes, including redox balance, iron metabolism, and amino acid, lipid, and glucose metabolism. This review focuses on the role of epigenetic factors in tumor ferroptosis, exploring their mechanisms and potential applications in cancer therapy. It synthesizes current knowledge to provide a comprehensive understanding of epigenetic regulation in tumor cell ferroptosis, offering insights for future research and clinical applications."

However, previous research shows they commonly experience suboptimal intakes of energy and carbohydrate. To date, little research has been conducted to understand the causes of their poor dietary intakes. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess infantry trainees' dietary intakes and (2) explore their beliefs, barriers, and self-efficacy toward performance nutrition using the Health Belief Model (HBM).\n\nMETHODS: Participants undergoing their 17-week Australian Army Infantry Initial Employment Training (Infantry IET) were recruited. During weeks 1 and 17, self-reported dietary intakes were assessed, and four focus groups were conducted.\n\nRESULTS: Mean daily energy, carbohydrate, and protein intakes were 7864 ± 1135 kJ, 1.8 ± 0.6 g/kg, and 1.5 ± 0.3 g/kg, respectively, in week 1, and 9084 ± 2535 kJ/day, 2.2 ± 1.1 g/kg and 1.5 ± 0.2 g/kg, respectively, in week 17. Three themes and seven subthemes were developed from the focus group data, falling under the following HBM domains: Cues to Action, Perceived Barriers, and Self-Efficacy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Infantry trainees' ability to eat well for their health and performance was hindered by their limited time during their intensive training schedule, their limited access to a sufficient variety of healthy foods, and their limited self-efficacy regarding performance nutrition. They require further performance nutrition knowledge, especially in regard to adopting practical fueling and refueling strategies surrounding physical training, as well as access to a greater quantity and variety of healthy foods outside of their main mealtimes."

Conventional therapies are limited due to the poor availability and opaque evidence, and electroacupuncture (EA) is considered an alternative for improving insomnia in patients with ESRD undergoing MHD.\n\nMETHODS: This is a study protocol for a pilot randomized, sham-controlled, single-center, clinical trial. A total of 60 patients with insomnia in ESRD undergoing MHD will be randomly assigned to treatment group (EA, 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks), or sham group (sham EA, 3 sessions per week for 4 weeks) in a 1:1 ratio. Participants will complete the trial by visiting the research center at Week 8 for a follow-up assessment. The primary outcome is the response rate: the proportion of patients achieving a minimal clinically important difference, which is defined as ≥7 points on insomnia severity index (ISI) at Week 4 compared with baseline. Secondary outcomes include sleep diary, ISI, pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), short form health survey-12 (SF-12), fatigue severity scale (FSS), 24-Hour ambulatory blood pressure, and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-Dimer.\n\nDISCUSSION: This is the first standardized protocol investigating the efficacy and safety of EA for patients with ESRD undergoing MHD.

The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) has categorized supplements based on scientific evidence regarding their efficacy and safety. Despite extensive global research on dietary supplement use among athletes, data on Polish athletes remain limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate supplement use among Polish athletes, considering their competitive level and gender. Additionally, it assessed whether athletes select supplements in accordance with the AIS classification and examined their awareness of supplement certification programs.\n\nMETHODS: This cross-sectional study included 659 Polish athletes (309 women, 350 men) from various sports, representing both professional (57.7%) and nonprofessional (42.3%) levels. An online questionnaire was used to assess dietary supplement consumption, sources of information regarding supplementation, and knowledge of anti-doping and supplement certification programs. Supplement use was categorized according to the AIS classification (Groups A - D). Statistical analyses, including chi-square tests and Mann - Whitney U tests, were conducted to evaluate differences between professional and nonprofessional athletes, as well as between male and female participants.\n\nRESULTS: A high prevalence of dietary supplement use (91.1%) was observed among Polish athletes, with no significant differences between professional (95.8%) and nonprofessional (94.3%) athletes or between men (92.0%) and women (90.0%). The most frequently consumed supplements were sports drinks (63.9%), electrolyte supplements (51.6%), and isolated protein supplements (54.6%), vitamin D (71.6%), vitamin C (59.8%), with significantly higher intake among professional athletes. Male athletes were more likely than females to consume caffeine (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the widespread use of dietary supplements among Polish athletes, irrespective of competitive level or gender. While many athletes select supplements from AIS Group A, their knowledge of AIS classification and supplement certification programs remains limited. The high reliance on social media for supplement information, combined with the lack of professional guidance, underscores the need for improved education on safe and effective supplementation practices. Given the risks associated with supplement contamination, targeted initiatives should enhance athletes' awareness of anti-doping regulations and certified supplement options."

The Nephroseq database was used to analyze the effect of hub genes on renal function, and the importance of lumican, a gene potentially related to DN progression, was further examined in clinical samples. GO and KEGG analyses were performed on lumican and its interacting proteins to elucidate their main biological functions and related pathways.\n\nRESULTS: We identified 1139 DEGs. GO enrichment analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly involved in responses to hexose, cell-cell junctions. GSEA-KEGG enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were related to amino acid metabolism, adipokine signaling. Nephroseq database analysis revealed that hub genes were upregulated in the kidney tissues of patients with DN and that their expression was negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Lumican was among the top hub genes, and its expression was increased in renal tissues of DN patients as confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence.

It is categorized as ribosomopathy related to heterozygous allelic variations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes. Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a rare and etiologically heterogeneous condition, defined by the clinical triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and cleft palate.\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We present a 5-year-and-2-month-old Chinese boy diagnosed with DBA combined with RPS. He was born with micrognathia, cleft palate, and airway obstruction, resulting in neonatal asphyxia and feeding difficulties, which constitute the classic triad of PRS. Low-set ears, downslanted palpebral fissures, bilateral exotropia, a short neck, hypertelorism, a thenar muscle defect, and bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss were also observed in the boy. His motor and speech development were significantly delayed. In addition, he was found to be granulocytopenic at birth and severely anemic at 2 years and 10 months of age. Whole exome sequencing of peripheral blood revealed a heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?), a novel pathogenic mutation in RPS28. RPS28 is one of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes, which may contribute to DBA-related phenotypes. The boy underwent HSCT from 9/10 HLA-matched donor and his neutrophil and hemoglobin levels returned to normal.\n\nCONCLUSION: It is crucial to perform a genetic evaluation for syndromic bone marrow failure with congenital anomalies. A heterozygous mutation in the RPS28 gene (c.2T > C, p.Met1?) is a novel pathogenic mutation associated with DBA. HSCT is an effective treatment for hematological abnormalities in DBA."

This study aims to investigate the clinical characteristics of a pedigree exhibiting an inherited hemorrhagic disorder resembling GT, elucidate its molecular pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of blood management strategies for a proband who is pregnant with twins. The clinical data of the pedigree with inherited hemorrhagic disorder were collected, including the assessment of clinical, laboratory and thromboelastography (TEG) profiles. DNA samples were obtained for next-generation sequencing, encompassing the exons and flanking sequences of the ITGA2B and ITGB3 genes, as well as other genes associated with blood and immune deficiency. Bioinformatics software tools, such as PolyPhen-2, SIFT and MutationTaster, were employed to analyze the functional impact of mutations. Protein structural models for the new mutation type were generated using PyMOL. The phenotype of the proband in this pedigree with inherited platelet dysfunction and bleeding disorder was in accordance with GT. The proband shows persistent blood accumulation in the uterine cavity. Laboratory findings indicate normal PLT morphology, PLT count, MPV, and PDW.

The patient manifested slight chronic nephritic syndrome, and his serums tested positive for M protein (monoclonal IgA and λ). As a result of bone wear, the plasma cell ratio of these patients was confirmed to be mildly increased in peripheral blood smears. Just like typical IgA nephropathy or IgA vasculitis patients, serum poorly galactosylated IgA1 antibodies were found in the patient compared to the controls. The patient was diagnosed with mild mesangial proliferative IgA vasculitis based on renal biopsy. Besides, immunofluorescence/immunohistochemistry confirmed immune deposits predominantly containing galactose-deficient IgA1 (GD-IgA1) and λ in the glomerular mesangium and the walls of the skin's blood vessels. The pathological findings support the hypothesis that monoclonal IgA, which originate from bone marrow plasma cells, rather than mucosally primed B cells, also may be galactose deficient.

Body composition was measured using the InBody770 multi-frequency body composition analyzer. Plasma TMAO concentrations were assessed by ELISA. Cross-sectional analysis was performed after collecting demographic data, dialysis-related data, laboratory parameters, and body composition data from MHD patients.\n\nRESULTS: In MHD patients, the PEW group exhibited lower levels of hemoglobin (Hb), albumin (ALB), transferrin (TF), creatinine (Cr), triglycerides (TG), prealbumin (PALB), soft lean mass (SLM), body mass index (BMI), percent of body fat (PBF), arm muscle circumference (AMC), and phase angle (PHA) compared to the non-PEW group, while C-reactive protein (CRP) and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels, as well as Extracellular Water/Total Body Water (ECW/TBW) ratio, were higher in the PEW group than in the non-PEW group. After full adjustment, TMAO and ECW/TBW ratio were independent risk factors for PEW in MHD patients. Further, plasma TMAO levels correlated negatively with Cr, ALB, Hb, BMI, and PHA, and positively with ECW/TBW in MHD patients with PEW. The ROC curve analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for plasma TMAO in predicting PEW in MHD patients was 0.788.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma TMAO levels and certain body composition are associated with the occurrence of PEW in MHD patients. Plasma TMAO levels appear to serve as a potential predictive marker for the onset of PEW."

Some studies have shown that rugby players' dietary intake remains inadequate for the three macronutrients (carbohydrates [CHO], proteins and fats) required for optimal performance. This study aimed to describe the macronutrient intake of professional male rugby players at Zebre Rugby Club in Parma, Italy, during in-season, and to compare players' macronutrient intake to international recommendations.\n\nMETHODS: Thirty-four professional male rugby players participated in the cross-sectional study. A self-developed questionnaire, a food frequency questionnaire and food records (on training and competition days and off day) were used to investigate players' macronutrient intake. Anthropometric measurements were obtained using the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK) standardized techniques. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and associations were investigated using chi-square, Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank tests as applicable.\n\nRESULTS: The players' median age was 25.8 years (range 20.6-33.0 years) and 47.5% were Italian. Most players (64.7%) held forward positions and had a median of 5 years (range 2-14 years) of professional experience. More than 75.0% of players lived with a spouse or partner and 30.3% earned between 4 000-4 999 euros per month. The median body weight and height of players were 106.9 kg and 186.3 cm, respectively. The forwards weighed heavier (\n\nCONCLUSION: The study's findings can assist various stakeholders at Zebre Rugby Club to align rugby players' dietary requirements to their workload, and encourage players' adherence to dietary guidelines and recommendations. It is advised that attention be focused on accurate dietary education, intake and monitoring to promote individualization and optimal performance and recovery. Future research is needed to adapt standardized macronutrient recommendations for rugby-specific requirements and address obstacles that may impede the optimal intake of macronutrients."

While extreme nighttime sleep duration is linked to glomerular injury by prior studies, its impact on tubular damage remains unclear. Given that 7-9 h of sleep per night is widely recommended for maintaining overall health, this study aimed to assess whether long nighttime sleep duration is associated with renal tubular damage using both observational and genetic evidence.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 2,683 adults in rural China to assess the link between nighttime sleep duration and renal tubular damage (measured by retinol-binding protein and β2-microglobulin). Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to assess the causal relationship between prolonged nighttime sleep duration and elevated kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) levels.\n\nRESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression indicated that sleeping more than 9 h per night was associated with a 1.38-fold increased risk of renal tubular damage (95% CI: 1.11-1.71) compared to 7-9 h of sleep, with particularly pronounced effects observed in elderly individuals and women. MR analysis further supported a causal relationship between genetically predicted long nighttime sleep duration and elevated KIM-1 levels (\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide observational and genetic evidence linking prolonged nighttime sleep to increased renal tubular damage risk.

MDW was measured at admission, and its diagnostic accuracy was compared with Sepsis-3 criteria. Survival rates on day 28 and 90 were also recorded. Additionally, five machine learning (ML) models were tested to enhance diagnostic efficacy. Of 488 subjects, 90 were in the sepsis group and 398 in the control group. MDW showed a diagnostic area under the curve (AUC) of 0.82, comparable to C-reactive protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) with AUCs of 0.78 and 0.82, respectively. With a cut-off value of 25.25, MDW had a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.76. The positive and negative predictive values were 44% and 95%, respectively. When MDW was combined with platelet count, serum albumin, and hemoglobin in a random forest model, the AUC improved to 0.931. The model achieved a sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 0.732. MDW is a useful diagnostic marker for sepsis in patients with HIV, with strong sensitivity and specificity. Combining MDW with other lab markers can further enhance diagnostic accuracy."

Emerging technologies, including machine learning-driven enzyme discovery and computer-aided protein engineering demonstrate significant potential for enhancing enzyme performance. This review highlights that integrating intelligent detection systems with computer-aided enzyme design offers a transformative framework for proactive AF control throughout food and feed supply chains."

    "text": "Recent studies have confirmed the significant potential of the histamine H2 receptor (H2R) as a therapeutic target for multiple diseases, creating an urgent demand for efficient drug screening methodologies. To address this need, we developed an innovative technique utilizing immobilized H2R for the rapid identification and characterization of bioactive compounds from complex matrices. Compared with the previous screening methods, this approach can detect the binding mode of ligands on the basis of screening. In this study, the prepared H2R chromatographic column was successfully applied for kinetic interaction analysis between two specific ligands and the receptor. The bioactive compound screened and collected via the H2R column was identified as liquiritin using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap mass spectrometry (HPLC-IT-MS). Competitive displacement assays revealed that liquiritin competes with nizatidine and ranitidine for the same binding sites. Notably, as the concentration of famotidine in the mobile phase increased, an inverse shift in the retention time of liquiritin was observed. To elucidate this phenomenon, molecular docking simulations were performed. The results suggest that nizatidine and ranitidine compete with liquiritin for the same binding sites, reducing liquiritin-protein binding and increasing the proportion of free liquiritin, thereby causing a forward shift in the retention peak. In contrast, the acidic residues (ASP186, ASP98) of famotidine may reorganize the protein's surface charge through salt bridges or hydrogen bonds, altering the electrostatic interactions of liquiritin and leading to the observed peak shift. Additionally, at higher concentrations, famotidine may form multimolecular complexes that indirectly stabilize liquiritin-protein binding. Literature review revealed that, compared to nizatidine and ranitidine, famotidine exhibits a positive regulatory effect on β-arrestin-mediated receptor desensitization and internalization. These findings further demonstrate that the established H2R receptor chromatography model can effectively screen bioactive components and determine their binding modes. This study lays the foundation for screening bioactive compounds from traditional Chinese medicines using receptor chromatography and provides preliminary insights into their mechanisms of action."

In this study, the effects of cold plasma (CP)-assisted alcalase treatment on the structure, digestibility and allergenicity of TM were investigated. The results showed that CP pretreatment promoted the hydrolysis of TM by unfolding the structure and reducing the spatial site resistance. Compared with native TM, CP-assisted alcalase protease-treated TM showed a significant decrease in α-helix content, along with an increase in irregular curl and free sulfhydryl content. CP-assisted alcalase significantly decreased the IgE and IgG binding capacities of TM compared to native TM (87.56 % and 47.59 %, respectively). Moreover, the reduced stability of trypsin digestion further inhibited allergic reactions induced by TM. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that extensive enzymatic cleavage sites were identified within alcalase including M11, L46, A109, L144, and A235 substantially compromised the integrity of TM antigenic epitopes. The amount of intact antigenic epitope peptides in the TM from CP-assisted hydrolysis was reduced by 164 compared to hydrolysis alone, revealing the mechanism of reduced allergenicity of TM. It can be concluded that CP-assisted enzymatic hydrolysis presents a promising novel strategy for desensitizing aquatic products."

Their distinct inhibition kinetic modes, either competitive or mixed, could be interpreted by in silico molecular docking, which visualized interactions with both active and non-active site amino acid residues of HSA. Additionally, PP binding induced conformational changes in HSA, evidenced by a reduced enzyme intrinsic fluorescence. Further, saturation transfer difference - nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) revealed close interactions between specific parts of the PP's structure (e.g., aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups) and the enzyme surface, highlighting the key role of the structure-activity relationship.

Both cultures grew in the protein solution, primarily consuming sucrose naturally present in peas, while producing lactic acid, lowering pH to 4.8 in 4-7 h. The protein yield was unaffected by fermentation, but undesirable flavors were reduced, and bitterness decreased threefold. Powder solubility decreased by 20 %, but water absorption and foaming capacity increased twofold. Oil holding capacity, emulsion activity, protein surface hydrophobicity, and in vitro protein digestibility showed minimal changes.

Structural analysis revealed that CH-FA was formed spontaneously, driven primarily by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding. The electron tongue results demonstrated that the bitter value of CH was reduced by 30.89 %, which may be due to the improvement of the hydrophobic amino acid microenvironment and the reduction of binding to the bitter receptor, thereby reducing the bitterness.

However, how shear forces affect protein molecular structure leading to pasta quality and the allergenicity of pasta is not well understood. This study explored the impact of varying screw speeds (150 rpm and 550 rpm), which directly influence specific mechanical energy (SME) input during extrusion, on protein molecular weight distribution, cooking properties, and starch and protein digestibility in both regular durum wheat pasta and gluten-enriched pasta. Pasta produced at 550 rpm exhibited reduced water absorption and cooking time but significantly increased cooking loss, accompanied by a decrease in disulphide bonds. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results indicated that high screw speed caused the insolubility of glutenins and globulins while increasing the solubility of gliadins. Additionally, these structural changes corresponded to decreased ionic and hydrogen bonding and increased hydrophobic interactions. Although starch and protein enzymic digestibility was decreased with added gluten, the increased screw speed enhanced their digestion. Proteomic mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS analysis) revealed a reduction in the number of identified proteins and allergens in the digestate of pasta produced at 550 rpm, while the number of identified peptides increased. Additionally, added gluten delayed protein hydrolysis during the gastric phase and offset differences due to screw speed. This understanding aids in optimizing processing and formulations, balancing efficiency with pasta's nutritional and cooking quality."

DKR was calculated using the formula: (0.9 × fat +0.46 × protein) / (0.1 × fat +0.58 × protein + carbohydrates). Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for 19 confounders (demographics, comorbidities, lifestyle), restricted cubic splines, and mediation analyses. Robustness was assessed via propensity score matching.\n\nRESULTS: A higher DKR showed a linear dose-response reduction in depressive symptoms risk (OR = 0.13 per unit increase, 95 % CI:0.03-0.48, p = 0.003; Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 0.59, p = 0.012).. Mediation analyses revealed opposing effects: traditional obesity metrics (BMI, waist circumference, BRI) mediated adverse associations (-14.69 % to -11.43 %), while the body shape index (ABSI) displayed protective mediation (11.03 %, p < 0.001). None of the 12 inflammatory markers showed significant mediation, as indicated by p-values >0.05 or mediation proportions <5 %.\n\nCONCLUSION: DKR inversely associates with depressive symptoms risk, potentially through body composition remodeling rather than anti-inflammatory pathways. ABSI served as a positive mediator in the inverse association between DKR and depressive symptoms. Longitudinal studies are required to confirm causality and clinical utility of DKR."

Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of a library of 1,3-diaryl substituted pyrazole-based imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine carboxamides as promising anti-TB agents. In preliminary screening, 10 out of 26 compounds displayed potent in vitro inhibition against Mtb H37Rv with a MIC value of 0.03 μg/mL, which is 17-fold more potent than the first-line TB drug streptomycin, 33-fold more potent than ethambutol, and equipotent with isoniazid and rifampicin. Encouragingly, most of these compounds exhibited a selectivity index (SI) >3333.3 and CC₅₀ values >100 μg/mL against Vero cells, indicating they are over 3000 times more toxic to M. tuberculosis than to mammalian cells and demonstrate absence of cytotoxicity at concentrations effective against TB (MIC = 0.03 μg/mL). Among them, 12a, 14a, and 14d demonstrated remarkable activity against drug-resistant strains of Mtb with an MIC of 0.03 μM.

Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) has been implicated in various tissue remodeling processes; however, its role in lipid metabolism and fibrosis during the progression from AKI to CKD is not well understood.\n\nMETHODS: This study used a murine model of unilateral ischemia-reperfusion-induced AKI-to-CKD progression for in vivo analysis and employed transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)-induced fibrosis in Human Kidney-2 cells and primary mouse tubular epithelial cells for in vitro studies. The tubule-specific knockout and overexpression of SDC-1 mice were utilized to investigate kidney fibrosis and lipid metabolism.\n\nRESULTS: Following unilateral ischemia-reperfusion and TGF-β stimulation, SDC-1 expression was significantly reduced, exacerbating renal fibrosis. Notably, SDC-1 deficiency led to lipid accumulation in the kidneys, while its overexpression alleviated lipid overload and improved metabolic parameters. Furthermore, SDC-1 played a crucial role in regulating fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), and its absence resulted in increased FABP7 levels. Inhibition of FABP7 not only reduced fibrosis but also restored carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α expression, which suggests that the SDC-1/FABP7 axis is critical for maintaining lipid homeostasis and mitigating fibrosis in the kidney.\n\nCONCLUSION: These findings underscore the importance of SDC-1 in lipid metabolism and suggest that targeting lipid metabolic pathways may represent therapeutic strategies that can slow the progression of AKI to CKD."

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this resistance is essential for improved outcomes. Herein, we created a pazopanib-resistant 786-O-PR cell line, revealing an active mitophagy pathway and increased Parkin expression in the resistant cells. Knocking down Parkin enhanced the sensitivity of resistant cells to pazopanib, while its overexpression in parental cells induced resistance, which was partially reversed by the mitophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). In xenograft models, Parkin knockdown and pazopanib administration inhibited tumorigenesis. We further identified GLI Family Zinc Finger 2 (GLI2) as a potential Parkin regulator, with high expression correlating with advanced tumor stages and poor prognosis. Knocking down GLI2 increased pazopanib sensitivity and diminished mitophagy level in resistant cells; however, its overexpression enhanced resistance and mitophagy, with partial rescue achieved using 3-MA. Furthermore, GLI2 knockdown reduced Parkin mRNA and protein levels. In pazopanib-resistant 786-O-PR cells, GLI2 knockdown and Parkin overexpression partially restored pazopanib resistance, while GLI2 overexpression and Parkin knockdown in parental cells partially restored sensitivity. GLI2's binding sites on the Parkin promoter were identified using JASPAR database analysis and confirmed using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (CHIP-qPCR) and dual-luciferase assays, indicating GLI2's role in Parkin transcription. This study demonstrated that the GLI2-Parkin mitophagy pathway may be a therapeutic target for overcoming targeted therapy resistance in ccRCC."

Natural plant-based bioactive products are frequently preferred over synthetic chemicals for their safety and efficacy. This study aims to assess the therapeutic effectiveness of a botanical formulation, Immunogrit, in mitigating stress-associated senescence markers in the skin. d-Galactose (D-Gal) has been used to induce senescence-associated stress markers in HaCaT human keratinocytes. Additionally, a thorough chemical characterization employing ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (UPLC/MS-QToF) and high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) was performed to generate a comprehensive phytochemical profile of Immunogrit. In HaCaT cells, d-Gal-induction increased oxidative and nitrosative stress with a perturbed expression of cell cycle biomarkers. Enhanced SA-β-galactosidase activity and subsequent downregulation of nuclear protein, LMNB1, further established the suitability of d-Gal-induced HaCaT cells as the relevant skin model for investigating senescence-associated interventions at the molecular levels. Treatment of Immunogrit with d-Gal induction, prevented the upregulation of p16, p21, and p53 levels; and maintained the basal SA-β-galactosidase activity. This study also identified pAMPK and iNOS2 as the targets of d-Gal orchestrating oxidative and nitrosative stress. Immunogrit mitigated the d-Gal-modulated levels of pAMPK and iNOS2. Moreover, collagen degradation and upregulation of metalloprotease (MMP1 and MMP9) in d-Gal-induced HaCaT cells were ameliorated by Immunogrit treatment. Our findings highlight Immunogrit as a promising botanical therapy for alleviating the key cellular markers of senescence, in human keratinocytes."

Using the SARS-CoV-2 nAb as a proof-of-concept target, this system comprised a hybrid probe with the viral RBD as an antigen module covalently conjugated to a reporter DNA, and magnetic beads functionalized with the ACE2 mimic mini-protein as a receptor module, thereby recapitulating the natural antigen-receptor interactions. With this design, the neutralizing capability of nAb against the antigen was transformed into a competitive reduction of the probe binding and DNA amplification signal by qPCR. The NAD-qPCR demonstrated robust performance in quantifying commercial SARS-CoV-2 nAb with a LOD of 4 ng/μL. Furthermore, it was demonstrated to be capable of effectively profiling a large number of vaccinated donor serum with broad neutralization activity. Notably, the hybrid probe and the capture beads were designed modularly, which allows for straightforward adaptation to other pathogens by replacing the module component. This platform offers a rapid, high-throughput, and universally applicable approach for nAb detection in vaccine development and immune monitoring."

Although oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammation are associated with AAD, the precise interplay among these responses has remained unclear. In this study, aortas from mouse AD models were subjected to integrative ATAC-seq and RNA-seq analysis. The pathogenic targets governing oxidative stress, DNA damage, and inflammation were identified by single-cell RNA sequencing, ROS staining, chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with PCR (ChIP-PCR), and co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) analysis in the IFN-γ-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), mouse AAD model, and human ascending aortas. The transcriptional profiles of 191 differentially expressed genes revealed the IFN-γ response, oxidative stress-related NOD-like receptor, STING signaling pathways and marked elevation of STAT1, activated inflammation, DNA damage and ROS. Mechanistically, the activation of STAT1 binding on promoters of GBP3, H2aX and IFN-γ gene in nuclear as well as the interaction of GBP3 and STING protein in cytoplasm, determining a STAT1-GBP3-STING positive feedback loop triggering inflammation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress. Targeting this loop using STAT1 inhibitor Fludarabine impedes aortic degeneration while improving survival (60 % vs. 90 %) and reducing aortic expansion (2.34 ± 0.18 mm vs. 1.55 ± 0.15 mm) in the mouse AAD model. This study provides novel insights into a transcriptional program permitting aortic degeneration, warranting consideration of a critical target STAT1 for an anti-inflammation, anti-DNA damage, and anti-oxidative stress intervention as an attractive strategy to manage temporal-specific AD by modulating the STAT1-GBP3-STING positive feedback loop."

Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that osteoporosis is consistently associated with vascular calcification, drawing attention to the interactions between bones and blood vessels, and giving rise to the concept of the bone-vascular axis. The bone vascular axis involves several factors, including osteokines such as FABP3, PDGF-BB, MYGDF, and Aging Bone-Derived Extracellular Vesicles (AB-EVs), which influence vascular calcification. Simultaneously, calcified blood vessels secrete sclerostin, Dickkopf1 (Dkk-1), Activin-A, and frizzled-related protein (SFRP), further affecting bone metabolism. The bone-vascular axis is characterized by reciprocal regulation and influence between the skeletal and vascular systems, and is crucial for maintaining bone metabolic homeostasis and preventing cardiovascular disease. However, the causal relationship between these two systems, as well as the specific regulatory mechanisms and targets, remains unclear. Therefore, this review aims to explore the mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between bone and blood vessels from both the skeletal and vascular perspectives, as well as their common pathways, and to provide an overview of current therapeutic agents, with the goal of enhancing understanding of the bone-vascular association and offering new insights and approaches for clinical treatment."

The primary hypothesis of this study was that oxidative damage, caused in vivo by oxidative stress-a key factor in aging and various inflammatory diseases-deteriorates bone tissue quality by damaging bone collagen, the main component of the bone's organic phase. To test this hypothesis in vitro, bovine cortical bone specimens were exposed to neutral hypochlorous acid solution (a potent reactive oxygen species) to induce oxidative damage, which was measured in terms of carbonylation. Carbonylation is a stable biomarker of protein oxidation. Mechanical testing revealed degradation of cortical bone mechanical properties due to oxidation. There was a marked degradation of mechanical properties, specifically pre-yield and post-yield properties such as tensile (30-40 %) and compressive (19-23 %) yield strength, as well as tensile (25-45 %) and compressive (11-16 %) ultimate strength. Exposure to neutral hypochlorous acid solutions increased the carbonyl content (normalized to collagen content), confirming protein oxidative damage. In addition, the observed carbonyl levels in the oxidized groups were similar to those measured in human cortical bone specimens. Thermo-analytical tests including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and hydrothermal isothermal tension (HIT) tests, providing measures of collagen nativity and connectivity, revealed negative correlations with carbonyl content (r = -0.46, p = 0.0038). The hypothesis that physiological levels of oxidative damage generated in vitro degrade cortical bone mechanical properties by damaging the bone collagen has been confirmed. This suggests that oxidative damage of bone collagen is important towards understanding the degradation of bone quality in aging and various diseases."

This study investigates the interaction between proteins and structurally different nitrocellulose (CN) membranes and the resulting effects on signal intensity in an LFA under the influence of various buffer additives. The experiments focused on quantitative protein adsorption, protein stability, protein line printing and changes in signal intensity in a human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-assay. A method was established for detecting the widths and intensities of fluorescent protein lines. We were able to show that changes in signal intensity of LFAs are driven by accessibility of the antibodies, by hydrophilicity of the membrane or assisted adsorption of antibodies onto the membrane. Additionally, the inclusion of sodium chloride, polysorbate 80 and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate can enhance signal intensity. The method developed for protein line analysis has proven to be effective and can help to understand protein-membrane-interactions on a macroscopic level.

The NHs were assigned following a 1:1 allocation ratio for control and intervention. Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act model, intervention components were participatorily developed over the first 6 mo and implemented over the remaining 6 mo.

The protein 3C protease plays a crucial role as it blocks the virus replication. This study explores the potential of natural inhibitors, specifically Propolis compounds targeting the protein 3Cpro, which is a promising and less toxic alternative compared to the standard synthetic inhibitor, Rupintrivir.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE: A set of 60 propolis-derived molecules was selected and prepared for molecular docking simulations to evaluate their binding affinity to 3Cpro, then ligand-3Cpro protein interactions were visualized. A 200ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to assess the stability of the protein-ligand complexes, then the following MD parameters were analyzed: RMSD, RMSF, SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonding. Binding free energies were further estimated using MM-PBSA, and per-residue energy decomposition was performed to identify key stabilizing interactions.\n\nRESULTS: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A displayed binding energies of -8.0 kcal/mol and -8.78 kcal/mol, respectively, outperforming the reference inhibitor Rupintrivir (-6.66 kcal/mol). MD simulations revealed that both ligands effectively stabilize 3Cpro, with RMSD scores of 1.02 ± 0.10 nm and 1,21 ± 0.22, respectively, and are also more stable in the pocket than Rupintrivir. These ligands also reduced RMSF, SASA, and Rg scores. MM-PBSA calculations showed more favorable binding energies for Rutin (-35.65 kcal/mol) and Retusapurpurin A (-31.59 kcal/mol) compared to Rupintrivir (-25.44 kcal/mol). Per-residue decomposition further revealed strong energetic contributions from catalytic site residues (His40, Glu71, and Cys147), especially in the Rutin complex.\n\nCONCLUSION: The potential compounds Rutin and Retusapurpurin A are promising inhibitors targeting 3Cpro, exhibiting elevated potential efficacy compared to Rupintrivir. These results pave the way for the development of natural antivirals derived from Propolis and support its use as a dietary supplement for the treatment of rhinovirus infections. The chemical diversity of Propolis could limit the emergence of viral resistance. However, in vitro and in vivo experimental validation is required to confirm these observations."

    "text": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive condition with incompletely understood pathogenesis, affecting over 10 % of the global population. The poor understanding of these mechanisms impedes therapeutic development, leaving current treatments largely ineffective at halting or reversing disease progression. The balance between damage and repair in renal tubular epithelial cells, the primary renal parenchymal cells, is pivotal to CKD progression, and excessive damage to these cells significantly contributing to tubular atrophy and renal fibrosis. Recent studies leveraging single-cell sequencing reveal disease-associated dynamics and molecular drivers in renal tubular epithelial cells, with findings suggesting that alternative splicing (AS) represents a novel pathogenic mechanism in CKD. This review focuses on the regulatory mechanisms of AS and its documented and emerging roles in CKD pathogenesis. Certain CKD driver molecules can globally regulate AS, while key CKD marker genes are prone to generating functionally distinct splice isoforms. In addition, the pathogenic mechanism of many familial kidney disease patients is gene mutation leading to abnormal splicing. This review aims to elucidate the functional link between AS and CKD, highlighting AS-targeting approaches as a potential therapeutic strategy. However, future research should further investigate the dynamics of AS and its regulators in CKD, and delineate their functional contributions."

    "text": "Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are a category of protein-coding RNA, and their dysregulation is closely implicated in diverse cancers. Static DNA nanodevices have been engineered for the imaging and therapy, but they rely on the pre-assembly of DNA components and are limited by the low imaging contrast. Herein, we demonstrate the tumor microenvironment-responsive dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires for high-contrast imaging of multiple mRNAs and chemotherapy. We design a cruciform DNA module (C-model) as a basic structural unit of DNAzyme nanowire, which consists of two DNAzyme strands and two substrate strands with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX) being inserted into the C-models by inlaying between guanine and cytosine. Once approaching tumor cells, C-models with two split i-motif spontaneously assemble into a DNAzyme nanowire through protonation-driven Hoogsteen interaction in response to extracellular acidic microenvironments. Upon the internalization, intracellular TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA hybridize with the overhangs of DNAzyme strands and substrate strands to form a stable DNAzyme/substrate/target three-way junction, inducing the cleavage of substrates by DNAzymes and the recovery of Cy5/Texas Red fluorescence. AS1411 aptamer-functionalized DOX-nanowires can selectively endocytose into cancer cells via AS1411-mediated recognition of nucleolin overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. Notably, the dynamic self-assembly of DNAzyme nanowires is characterized by efficient intracellular delivery and intrinsic resistance to nucleases, facilitating the high-contrast imaging of mRNAs. This method can accurately measure TK1 mRNA and GalNAc-T mRNA in living cells and discriminate multiple mRNAs in breast cancer tissues and their normal counterparts, providing a powerful platform for clinical diagnosis."

Plasma FA profile was analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Body composition and hepatic steatosis were analysed using computerised tomography. Tumour tissue underwent transcriptomic analysis for consensus molecular subtype (CMS) stratification. Patients with CC (median age 73 years, 46.5% women) had significantly decreased total plasma FA content versus controls (median age 58 years, 41.2% women) (1510.0 nmol/mL vs. 4194.6 nmol/mL median values respectively, p < 0.001). This reduction (≥50%) was consistent across all species, independently of sex, age, body composition or cancer stage. An elevated unsaturated-to-saturated FA ratio was observed in CMS2 tumours (p = 0.01). Plasma inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and fibrinogen) were above normal range in patients in a stage-dependent manner (p < 0.01). Hepatic enzymes fell within normal range, yet increased with tumour stage. This study indicates that plasma FA content reduction is an intrinsic metabolic alteration of CC already occurring in early stages. Further research will aid clinical significance."

Participants completed self-reported questionnaires on demographic characteristics, physical health, activity levels, dietary index scores, dietary habits, and depressive symptoms.\n\nRESULTS: Participants were female (OR: 1.38, 95 % CI: 1.30-1.46), divorced or widowed (OR: 1.56, 95 % CI: 1.31-1.85), had a higher waist-hip ratio, and (OR: 2.22; 95 % CI: 1.43-3.43) and engaged in prolonged sedentary time (OR: 1.51; 95 % CI: 1.41-1.62) were more likely to report depressive symptoms.

These findings suggest potential links between dietary and lifestyle factors and depressive symptoms, which may warrant further investigation in prospective or interventional studies."

Caffeine, glutamate (Glu), myricetin-3-galactoside (Myr-gala), hyperoside (Que-gala), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (Kae-rut), and theaflavin-3'-gallate (TF-3'-G) were found to significantly influence taste, with TF-3'-G being the most contributing.

Ritonavir, XK263, and AHA001 are inhibitors that can bind to Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) protease to disrupt its enzymatic activity. However, various dynamic intracellular environments can develop a harmonic force, ultimately dissociating these ligands from the HIV-1 binding pocket, which are essential to study. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enable a platform to efficiently visualize and quantify the bound-unbound states of these ligand molecules in the presence of applied harmonic forces. We investigate the unbinding of Ritonavir, XK263, and AHA001 molecules from the HIV-1 protease dimer using an all-atom Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) simulation that induces an external stimulus as a constant harmonic force. The potential of mean force (PMF) calculations from the trajectories generated by SMD simulations show insights into the free energy landscape associated with the ligand's dissociation from HIV-1 protease, including the energetic barriers and favorable interactions involved in the process. Our results show that Ritonavir, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA approved antiretroviral drug for HIV-1, has enhanced binding strength, followed by AHA001, which also shows a strong binding affinity comparable to many other FDA-approved drugs, as evidenced by the binding free energy calculations derived from Umbrella Sampling (US) simulations. The transient variations of corresponding protein-ligand interaction energies and calculations for hydrogen bond formation agree with the earlier findings. The predictions contribute to understanding how these three ligands can act as effective inhibitors for the HIV-1 viral protein."

The presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, pathological hallmarks of PD primarily composed of aggregated α-Syn, further underscores its critical involvement. This correlation has led to the hypothesis that α-Syn aggregation actively contributes to PD development. Recent studies have implicated oligomers formed during the initial phases of protein aggregation as the primary neurotoxic agents driving cellular degeneration in PD. This pathological process worsens mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and microglial activation, ultimately contributing to SNpc degeneration and PD progression. Currently, available PD medications only provide symptomatic relief and do not address underlying neuropathological mechanisms such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, α-syn aggregation, or SNpc degeneration. Moreover, long-term use of anti-PD drugs like L-DOPA can lead to motor complications and systemic side effects. As a result, repurposing traditional herbal medicines with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties presents a promising therapeutic approach. Studies suggest that berberine (BBR) may mitigate PD-related neuropathology. However, the exact mechanisms by which BBR exerts its neuroprotective effects remain unclear. This review explores the potential molecular pathways through which BBR could alleviate PD pathology."

Utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) in conjunction with genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we identified proteins that exhibit significant associations with delirium. Additionally, we investigated the bidirectional relationship between delirium and aging-related indicators, such as the frailty index (FI), Intrinsic Epigenetic Age Acceleration (IEAA), PhenoAge, and life expectancy. This was achieved through mediation analysis and Bayesian colocalization to assess the intermediary effects of these indicators. Finally, we assessed the therapeutic potential of the identified proteins via molecular docking studies.\n\nRESULTS: MR analysis revealed causal relationships between delirium and several aging-related indicators, including FI, IEAA, PhenoAge, and life expectancy. Eleven proteins were causally associated with delirium. Mediation analysis showed that the effects of HIBCH and IMPAD1 on delirium were mediated by PhenoAge, while IEAA mediated the effect of MICB. MST1's effect on delirium was mediated by FI and life expectancy. Bayesian colocalization confirmed strong associations between HIBCH, MST1, and delirium.

Next, MD simulations of six protein- golden ligand complexes (PDB IDs: 4QXQ, 5GS4, 5JL6, 5LX6, 6ME6, and 7PCD), performed with GROMACS over 100 ns at 298.15 K, provided valuable information about their structural dynamics. Analysis of the radius of gyration (Rg) revealed that, while five complexes (7PCD, 5GS4, 5LX6, 4QXQ, and 5JL6) maintained compact structures (Rg between 1.7 and 2.3 nm), the 6ME6 complex exhibited a more extended and flexible conformation (average Rg ∼3.4 nm). Complementary RMSD analysis confirmed that most complexes rapidly stabilized with minimal deviations (generally <0.3 nm), whereas the 6ME6 complex showed higher variability, reaching up to 0.67 nm. Furthermore, Binding free energy calculations using MM-GBSA and PBSA methods further supported these findings, with energies ranging from -21.45 ± 2.28 kcal/mol (5LX6) to -39.79 ± 1.34 kcal/mol (6ME6), indicating an optimal balance between intrinsic interactions and desolvation costs in the 6ME6 and 5JL6 systems. Based on DFT results, the golden ligand showed higher stability and lower reactivity compared to control ligands such as aromatase, tamoxifen, and dacomitinib, potentially leading to reduced off-target interactions and a more favorable safety profile. The integration of these data underscores the therapeutic potential of SCHEMBL7562664 as a multi-target agent for breast cancer, with promising pharmacokinetic properties that can be optimized for local treatment by incorporation into a 3D scaffold."

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) from astrocytes drive this process, yet the release mechanism, potentially involving extracellular vesicles (EVs), remains unclear. Rab27a releases EVs from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) by enabling their docking and fusion with the plasma membrane. We confirmed Rab27a expression, and its localization, subsequently, EV release was validated with CD9, Alix, and TSG101 markers. Rab27a-mediated EV release was confirmed in both Rab27a-induced and Rab27a-siRNA-treated cells. Rab27a-derived EVs inhibited neuronal cell growth, while Rab27a-siRNA EVs promoted neuronal growth. Our study also observed upregulated Rab27a expression in the rat contusion model of SCI. Further analysis showed increased CSPG expression in Rab27a-induced conditions via the Rho/ROCK pathway, with altered pAkt, and β-tubulin III, levels. Immunohistochemistry confirmed CSPG/Rab27a/GFAP and CSPG/CD9 co-localization in tissue sections, verifying that Rab27a mediates EV release containing CSPG from astrocytes. These findings suggest that Rab27a plays a crucial role in CSPG release via EVs and scar formation. Functional recovery was significantly improved with Rab27a-siRNA treatment, suggesting Rab27a as a potential target for astrocytic scar modulation in SCI. The study reveals the detailed mechanistic insight of Rab27a-dependent CSPG release via EVs for sub-acute scar formation in contusion SCI."

Secondary endpoints were recurrent cardiovascular composite events (HF hospitalizations, urgent HF visits, cardiovascular death) and adverse events (symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, worsening renal function).\n\nRESULTS: Of 454 (97.4%) patients with LVH and LAE data, 157 (34.5%) had both LVH and LAE, 178 (39.2%) had either LVH or LAE, and 119 (26.2%) had neither LVH nor LAE. Greater reduction in NT-proBNP with sac/val vs val was consistent across groups (P interaction = 0.705). There was no significant interaction between treatment and degree of structural abnormalities for other efficacy endpoints. Patients with both LVH and LAE had significantly higher odds of hyperkalemia with sac/val (OR 2.41, P interaction = 0.024).\n\nCONCLUSION: Patients with LVEF>40% and recent WHF had greater reduction in NT-proBNP with sac/val vs val, regardless of the degree of structural abnormalities. There was no difference in the effects of sac/val on efficacy endpoints across structural abnormality group. Patients with both LVH and LAE had higher odds for hyperkalemia with sac/val."

    "text": "Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) technology has garnered great attention due to its advantages in targeted protein degradation, promising its potential for treating malignant cancer. Nevertheless, the inherent drawbacks of PROTAC technology hinder its clinical translation. The integration of nanotechnology with PROTAC molecules to create nano-PROTACs for combined therapy offers a promising solution. Among the various cancer treatment methods, phototherapy is considered the optimal choice to integrate with specific PROTACs due to its proven effectiveness and non-invasive nature. Herein, a nano-PROTAC formulation (ARV@PEG-ICG) consisting of a phototherapeutic agent named indocyanine green functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG-ICG) and a BRD4 degrader (ARV-825) was fabricated for cancer photo-immunotherapy. Activated by acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), ARV@PEG-ICG nanoparticles (NPs) will decompose rapidly for ARV delivery. PEG-ICG generated abundant ROS with laser irradiation, downregulating the expression of Bcl-xL and inducing the cleavage of PARP to stimulate cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the degradation of BRD4, a transcriptional cofactor, inhibited nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) generation to improve phototherapeutic efficacy. In a 4T1 breast tumor model, dying 4T1 cells released tumor associated antigens (TAAs) to serve as the immunogenic cell death (ICD) inducer, facilitating DC maturation and T cell activation and amplifying systemic immune response. The distant tumor growth can also be inhibited due to the activation of long-term immune response. Overall, the current study aims to combine typical PROTAC with functional nanomaterials to form nano-PROTAC with high performance for PROTAC delivery mediated cancer treatment."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors have emerged as a leading platform for gene therapy, supported by several FDA-approved products and numerous clinical trials. Due to their biological complexity and heterogeneity, rigorous analytical methods are essential to ensure the quality, safety, and efficacy of rAAV-based products. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) such as aggregation, full/empty capsid ratios, viral protein composition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) must be monitored comprehensively. While several chromatographic techniques address individual CQAs, there is a growing industrial need for techniques that enable multi-attribute analysis in a single run.\n\nRESULTS: In this study, we developed a multidimensional size-exclusion chromatography-ultraviolet detection-reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-UV-RPLC-MS) method for the comprehensive characterization of rAAV vectors. The method enables simultaneous assessment of high molecular weight species (aggregates), capsid identity, and PTMs. In the first dimension, SEC separates intact viral particles and quantifies aggregates, followed by a targeted heart-cut of the monomeric fraction. This fraction is then subjected to RPLC for protein separation under denaturing conditions, with high-resolution MS used to identify viral proteins and their modifications. Initially optimized for rAAV8, the method was successfully extended to other rAAV serotypes, demonstrating its adaptability across serotypes. A forced degradation study under thermal stress conditions further highlighted the method's ability to monitor structural integrity and stability of the viral vectors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: This study presents a novel 2D-LC-MS approach for streamlined, multi-attribute analysis of viral vector products. By combining multiple analyses into a single run, this 2D-LC-MS method can be considered as a powerful tool for comprehensive analysis of gene therapy vectors in the future. Potential applications include real-time in-process control, comparability studies, stability testing, support during process development for aggregate or PTM profiling, and drug substance or product characterization."

Inspired by the heterogeneous interfacial structure of natural skin, this study developed a chitosan(CS)-based Janus wound dressing with asymmetric wettability. The inner layer consists of methacrylated chitosan (CSMA), incorporating polydopamine-coated silica (PDA-SiO₂) nanoparticles to form a hydrophilic sponge with hemostatic, antioxidant, and pro-angiogenic properties. The outer layer is a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofiber membrane integrated with antibacterial agent zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), creating a hydrophobic barrier to prevent bacterial invasion. In vitro tests confirmed effective bacterial resistance, while hemostasis assays demonstrated enhanced platelet and red blood cell aggregation, accelerating coagulation. In vivo evaluations using rat liver injury and tail amputation models confirmed superior hemostatic performance, with blood loss reduced by 0.44 g and 0.23 g, respectively, and bleeding time shortened by 41.52 s and 59.47 s compared to Gauze. Furthermore, in full-thickness skin wound models, accelerated healing was achieved through infection prevention, increased collagen deposition (20.82 % higher than Control), and stimulated angiogenesis (3.10 % higher CD31 expression). These findings highlight CM@PS/TZ as a promising Janus dressing integrating antibacterial activity, hemostasis, and pro-angiogenic effects, offering an innovative solution for hemorrhagic wound treatment."

We designed and synthesized a series of O-glucoside derivatives by introducing nitrogen-containing heterocyclic fragments. Among them, compound E9 showed the most protective effect on the glucose-free DMEM-induced injured cardiomyocytes, and the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of these compounds were preliminarily evaluated in cardiomyocyte injury model. Furthermore, compound E9 significantly enhanced the inhibition of SGLT2, NHE1, and SOD enzyme activity, increased ATP levels in damaged cardiomyocytes, and suppressed Ang II-induced myocardial fibrosis, the autophagy receptor protein P62 and the expression of cell injury markers. Additionally, compound E9 significantly improved cardiac function in TAC-induced HF mice, inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition, ameliorated myocardial tissue damage, enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in injured cardiomyocytes, and ultimately increased survival rates in HF mice. In conclusion, this study reveals that the novel O-glucoside derivative E9 was a promising compound for the treatment of heart failure."

Alternative proteins, including plant-based, cultured meats, insects, algae, and microbial proteins, offer promising solutions; however, knowledge of their digestibility is limited, and the reported documents are often quite low. For instance, plant proteins contain anti-nutritional factors like phytic acid and trypsin inhibitors, which hinder absorption. Similarly, insects, algae, and microbial proteins have complex cellular structures or compounds that can interfere with protein breakdown and absorption. On the other hand, cultured meats may lack certain components critical for optimal digestion. Thus, novel and conventional processing methods are being studied to improve digestibility. In this context, continued research is essential to refine these techniques for different protein sources, ensuring a sustainable production of alternative proteins with high nutritional quality."

Quercetin and caffeic promoted nearly iron release at all polyphenol-to-complex levels studied (0.5:1 to 3:1), whereas gallic acid only promoted iron release at higher ratios (3:1). Polyphenol retention after digestion was relatively low (1 %-7 %), except for caffeic acid (21.5 % at 3:1). A Caco-2 cell assay showed that ferritin production was enhanced at high gallic acid levels (3:1), and intermediate quercetin levels (1:1), but not under other conditions.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) assessed depressive symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression, Pearson correlation, and mediation analyses were conducted to evaluate odds ratios and associations between inflammatory indicators and depression.\n\nRESULTS: Correlation analysis revealed significant negative associations between four inflammatory indicators (CRP, C-reactive protein; PC, platelet count; SII, systemic immune-inflammation index; PPN, product of platelet count and neutrophil count) and HDL cholesterol, as well as between HDL cholesterol and depression, while the inflammatory indicators were significantly positively correlated with depression (all p < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for covariates, demonstrated that elevated levels of these four inflammatory indicators (CRP: adjusted OR = 1.011, CI = 1.003-1.025; PC: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004; SII: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.003; PPN: OR = 1.002, CI = 1.001-1.004) were significantly associated with an increased risk of depression in the total study population. Finally, mediation analysis indicated that HDL cholesterol mediated the presumed causal associations between CRP (6.7-13.2 %), PC (4.5-12.8 %), PPN (4.8-14.9 %), and depression, whereas SII was identified as an independent predictor of depression development.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Targeting HDL cholesterol and inflammatory indicators such as CRP, PC, SII and PPN may provide potential interventions for mitigating depression risk."

    "text": "The determination of the PMI remains one of the most critical challenges within the field of forensic science. Nonetheless, the estimation of PMI has emerged as one of the most complex and challenging domains of research within the field, primarily due to the absence of precise and dependable methodologies, coupled with the advanced decomposition processes of cadavers. To address these challenges, researchers have tried many methods, such as insects, microorganisms, body fluids, and animal tissues. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of research specifically examining human skeletal muscle. In this study, we collected a substantial number of human skeletal muscle samples and employed ATR-FTIR spectroscopy combined with multiple machine learning to analyze spectral changes in skeletal muscle across different PMIs. These methods primarily included PLS-R, PCR, CLS-R, MLR, SVR, and XGB-R to predict the PMI of human skeletal muscle. The results revealed distinct spectral variations in the protein, carbohydrate, and nucleic acid regions of skeletal muscle across different PMIs. Notably, the absorption peak at the 1540 cm"

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Triazole antifungal drugs are commonly used in clinical settings to treat life-threatening invasive fungal diseases. The development of an analysis method for the sensitive monitoring of antifungal drugs is crucial, given their narrow therapeutic index. Traditional plasma sample processing involves several complex steps. Some of the processes are time-consuming, may result in the loss of trace components, and increase the difficulty of detection. To address these limitations, this work focused on developing a multi-component covalent organic framework (COF) coated solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber for efficient extraction and determination of triazole antifungal drugs in human plasma.\n\nRESULTS: The multi-component COF TAPT-DMTP-TFTA was synthesized using 4,4',4''-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)trianiline (TAPT), 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoroterephthaldehyde (TFTA), and 2,5-dimethoxyterephthalaldehyde (DMTP), which exhibited high surface areas, considerable regular porosity and multiple recognition sites, rendering it an ideal adsorbent for the efficient enrichment of antifungal drugs. The COF-based SPME fiber was integrated with a high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) system for the effective extraction of antifungal drugs from human plasma. With optimized conditions, the method showed excellent linearity for voriconazole (VOR), posaconazole (POS) and isavuconazole (ISA) in the concentration range of 0.01-20 μg/mL, and for itraconazole (ICZ) within 0.05-20 μg/mL, achieving correlation coefficients (R\n\nSIGNIFICANCE AND NOVELTY: The newly synthesized multi-component COF exhibited high specific surface area, well-defined pores, and multiple recognition sites. The SPME-HPLC-MS method utilizing a COF TAPT-DMTP-TFTA-coated fiber demonstrated simplicity, efficiency, and effective protein exclusion capabilities, thereby addressing the low enrichment efficiency and loading capacity of traditional methods, highlighting its great potential for the detection of antifungal drugs in biological fluids."

Their presence has been detected in human tissues, including blood and placental tissue, raising concerns about developmental effects. However, MPs' effects on the development of human organs are still mostly unknown. The kidney is essential to detoxification and waste excretion in the body and is highly sensitive to toxic substances, making it an important focus for research on toxicity. To study kidney development, human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived kidney organoids offer a useful in vitro model. This research specifically examines the consequences of PS-MPs on the differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney organoids. Different concentrations of PS-MPs (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 μg/mL) were set according to the concentration of PS-MPs detected in blood at 1.6 μg/mL. The aim is to understand how environmental contaminants may impact kidney development at the cellular level. Our findings indicate that PS-MP exposure leads to nephron progenitor cell damage and disrupts key processes involved in kidney development, including nephron formation and epithelial cell differentiation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PS-MPs induce mitochondrial oxidative stress, activate the Bcl-2 protein family, and trigger apoptosis via the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-9/caspase-3 signaling pathway. This disruption ultimately impairs normal kidney organoid formation. These results underscore the detrimental impact of PS-MPs on embryonic kidney development and highlight the urgent need for further investigation into the health risks associated with microplastic exposure during early human development."

    "text": "Glycosylation of membrane proteins plays an essential role in diverse biological processes. However, it remains unknown whether this posttranslational modification occurs on ciliary membrane proteins. Herein, by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis, we demonstrate that multiple membrane proteins localized in the ciliary transition zone undergo core fucosylation, an N-linked glycosylation specifically catalyzed by fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8). In-depth analysis reveals that FUT8 interacts with transmembrane protein 67 (TMEM67), a transition zone component closely linked to ciliopathies, and catalyzes its core fucosylation. Functional investigation shows that core fucosylation stabilizes TMEM67 by impeding its degradation via the autophagy pathway, thereby ensuring its proper localization to the transition zone to promote cilium formation. Fut8-deficient mice exhibit ciliary defects in multiple organs, such as the kidney, brain, and trachea. These findings uncover a critical role for TMEM67 core fucosylation in ciliogenesis and have important implications for the pathogenesis of ciliopathies."

Gremlin 1 (GREM1), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist family, has emerged as a central regulator of cellular and extracellular dynamics, exhibiting dual roles in oncogenesis and fibrosis. By modulating BMP and TGF-β signaling pathways, GREM1 orchestrates critical pathogenic processes, including immune evasion, stromal dynamics, fibroblast activation, and angiogenesis. This review compiles current mechanistic insights into GREM1's dual roles in cancer and fibrosis, highlighting its potential as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target. GREM1 contributes to tumor progression by promoting an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and therapy resistance while driving extracellular matrix deposition and tissue remodeling in fibrotic disorders. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including demethyleneberberine (DMB), anti-GREM1 antibodies, and circular RNAs, demonstrate potential in mitigating GREM1-driven pathological processes. GREM1's pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cancer and fibrosis highlights its promise as a target for innovative combination therapies and biomarker-based precision medicine approaches. However, translating these insights into clinical practice requires addressing challenges related to delivery specificity, off-target effects, and patient heterogeneity."

It exerts this effect by dephosphorylating the insulin receptor (IR) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS), attenuating insulin activity. It is a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily member, which includes a wide range of enzymes encoded by 107 distinct genes. The catalytic site of the PTP superfamily is positively charged and highly conserved among its members, which presents a significant challenge to developing inhibitors in terms of selectivity and oral bioavailability. T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), which plays a crucial role in the proliferation of T-cells and B-cells, is a close homologue of PTP1B, sharing 74 % sequence similarity within the catalytic domain. Although considerable efforts have been made to develop a selective and potent PTP1B inhibitor, no molecule has yet been developed as a drug. However, a few candidate compounds reached phase II clinical trials, but their further study was discontinued due to suboptimal efficacy and the manifestation of undesirable side effects. In this review, we aimed to decipher the complications associated with the PTP1B enzyme and the design strategies used by various research groups to develop small-molecule inhibitors, emphasising the structure-activity relationship of small molecules synthesized for this target. This review also delineates the molecular features, which will aid in designing rational approaches and foster further research into this target of type 2 diabetes mellitus."

Considering their multifactorial nature, research has focused on the study of small molecules able to simultaneously tackle different targets involved in their onset and progression. In this paper, two sets of acylaminopyrazole-based compounds were designed to exploit the aminopyrazole core as a privileged structure properly decorated with an acyl moiety and a further amide function, connected with a proper spacer. Indeed, acylated aminopyrazoles could be able to establish the appropriate hydrogen bond pattern to both bind GSK-3β, responsible for tau hyperphosphorylation, prevent the formation of insoluble Aβ-protein aggregates and have the structural features to show chelating properties towards metals involved in neuroinflammation. The collection of compounds was tested in vitro for GSK-3β inhibition activity, antiaggregating and chelating properties. Selected compounds were able to inhibit GSK-3β in the low micromolar range with a reversible and competitive mechanism of action, as established by Microfluidic Mobility Shift Assay (MMSA) and showed metal chelating ability. Preliminary Structure Activity Relationships (SARs) to hit these distinct and interconnected targets for neuromodulation were established. Finally, selected compounds showed good apparent permeability values in parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA) together with good cellular safety profile. The collected results validated acylaminopyrazole as promising scaffold for the development of multitarget-directed ligands. Compounds 1c and 4c emerged as promising prototypes, and deserve further optimization in the search for drug candidates for polypharmacological approach in neurodegenerative disease."

Due to its smaller molecular size, catechin more easily penetrated the hydrophobic cores of proteins, yielding higher binding stoichiometry and concentration-dependent aggregation. At 4 mM, extensive aggregation masked proteolytic cleavage sites, reducing gastrointestinal digestibility by 7.3 % for 7S and 15.1 % for 11S. In contrast, EGCG, with an additional galloyl moiety and a denser hydroxyl network, interacted with proteins through synergistic hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and hydrophobic forces. It produced more stable supramolecular complexes with much larger diameters (462.2 ± 6.8 nm for 11S-EGCG, versus 30.3 ± 1.5 nm for native 11S), and lowered IgE-binding capacity by approximately 19.5-38.7 %, probably through epitope masking and surface-charge changes. For both polyphenols, binding significantly decreased solvent accessibility of hydrophobic regions, reorganized secondary structure (α-helix loss and β-sheet gain), and markedly enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity. These findings demonstrate that selecting an appropriate polyphenol type and dose can simultaneously confer hypoallergenic potential, controlled digestibility, and elevated antioxidant function.

The results showed that both encapsulation and ultrasonic treatment significantly enhanced the Qu embedding rate (ER), yield, and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the nanoliposome by 43.15 ± 1.29 %, 8.57 ± 0.74 %, and 24.38 ± 1.53 %, respectively, with an 87.50 ± 3.28 % decrease in diameter compared to unsonicated MP-Qu-Lipo.

Edible hydrogels, fabricated from natural polysaccharides and proteins, have emerged as promising alternatives for weight control. In this study, a highly swellable hydrogel encapsulating hypoglycemic and anti-inflammatory ginsenoside Rh4 was developed to regulate obesity, which integrated by natural-derivated carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and whey protein (WPI). The physical and chemical characterization results demonstrated the excellent mechanical properties and high swelling ratio of the designed hydrogel. The in vitro and in vivo results suggest that the hydrogel with optimized formulation exhibits significant drug sustained releasing, superior biocompatibility, as well as obesity-induced inflammation alleviation and intestinal flora regulation. Taken together, this edible hydrogel has the advantages for convenient preparation and reliable stability, conferring it with a great potential for the clinical obesity regulation."

    "text": "Pomegranate seed oil has been widely studied for its health-promoting properties. However, the bioavailability of its conjugated linolenic acids, an essential factor for assessing their impact on health, remains poorly understood. This study used the harmonized in vitro protocol INFOGEST to investigate the bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil in comparison to olive oil. Bioaccessibility, key aspect of bioavailability, refers to the proportion of a nutrient released in the gastrointestinal tract and available for intestinal absorption. It was determined by measuring the ratio of fatty acids present in the absorbable fraction (monoglycerides and free fatty acids) to total fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography following solid-phase extraction. Results showed that the overall bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil was equivalent to that of olive oil. Notably, punicic acid (in pomegranate seed oil) and oleic acid (in olive oil) - both 18‑carbon fatty acids present in equivalent quantities in the two oils, showed high and equivalent bioaccessibility. The presence of proteins (whey and soy protein isolates) did not affect the bioaccessibility of the major fatty acids under experimental conditions. The recovery index was high for all fatty acids, indicating minor degradation during in vitro digestion, and was not affected by the presence of oxygen. In conclusion, punicic acid is efficiently released by digestive lipases, suggesting good bioaccessibility of pomegranate seed oil. This finding paves the way for its potential application in oral therapeutic use."

We recently found that the activity of sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), an anti-aging molecule, is decreased with aging in keratinocytes, leading to the attenuation of CLDN4 expression and paracellular barrier function. SIRT2 may be a novel target for enhancing skin barrier function in elderly people. In vitro SIRT2 activity assay showed that epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and green tea extract (GT) have a potent ability to activate SIRT2. Tenovin-1 (Ten-1), a sirtuin-1/2 inhibitor, decreased the SIRT2 activity in human keratinocyte-derived HaCaT cells, which was rescued by EGCG and GT. Ten-1 decreased the protein level of CLDN4, which was rescued by EGCG, whereas CLDN1 expression was changed by neither Ten-1 nor EGCG. Ten-1 decreased the tight junctional localization of CLDN4, transepithelial electrical resistance, and paracellular permeability to FD4, a fluorescence paracellular flux marker, which were rescued by EGCG.

The endothelium plays a central role in the pathophysiology of IS, and its function can be evaluated using various methods. This study aims to investigate the relationship between endothelial dysfunction, age, and clinical outcomes in IS patients treated with EVT METHODS: Patients with IS treated with EVT were included in the study. Ninety-day prognosis was evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Endothelial function was assessed through flow-mediated dilation (FMD) measured by brachial artery ultrasound, and by quantifying pre-EVT arterial serum levels of arginine metabolites, homoarginine (hArg), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Clinical, radiological, and EVT procedural data were recorded as independent variables. The outcome variable is good functional outcome by dichotomized mRS<2. Bivariate, multivariate, and mediation analyses were conducted to explore associations.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 150 stroke patients were included in the analysis (median age was 77 years and 50.7 % were female). Older patients exhibited poorer endothelial function, reflected by lower FMD values and altered arginine metabolite profiles. They also showed worse clinical outcomes at 90 days. Among the metabolites, SDMA emerged as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (OR = 1.343 per 0.1 umol/l increase, p < 0.01). Moreover, SDMA was identified as a mediator in the relationship between age and unfavorable outcomes following EVT CONCLUSION: Endothelial dysfunction, as indicated by circulating biomarkers such as SDMA, may partially mediate the association between age and poorer outcomes in stroke patients treated with EVT."

For this, the study included 34 patients diagnosed with PPGLs. Pre-operative and postoperative serum samples were analyzed using 1D-proton NMR spectroscopy, and NMR spectral data were processed using Bruker software Topspin. The quantitative metabolic profiles were estimated using CHENOMX NMR-Suite, and multivariate data were analyzed using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal PLS-DA followed by random forest (RF) classification method (a machine learning approach). The multivariate analysis revealed distinct metabolic differences between pre-operative and postoperative samples with respect to normal control (NC) samples, indicating a metabolic shift following tumor resection. RF classification, with an out-of-bag error rate of 0.186, effectively distinguished between NC, presurgery, and postsurgery groups, underscoring the distinct metabolic states in PPGL and the restorative effect of surgical intervention. Pre-operative serum profiles of PPGL patients were characterized by decreased levels of key metabolites, including glucose, citrate, amino acids (glutamine, glycine, leucine, valine, tyrosine, and alanine), histidine, myo-inositol, and creatinine, suggesting altered energy metabolism, and amino acid catabolism induced by catecholamine excess. Postsurgical profiles showed partial metabolic restoration, with significant increases in proline, glutamate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) (p < 0.01), indicating normalization involving lipid oxidation and amino acid metabolism. Although plasma metanephrines normalized postsurgery, full biochemical recovery lagged, as metabolic profiles of postoperative patients remained distinct from healthy controls. In conclusion, the present untargeted NMR metabolomics revealed significant metabolic reprogramming in PPGL patients and captured the partial normalization of metabolic pathways following tumor resection. Metabolites such as proline, glutamate, and 3-HB emerged as potential biomarkers of treatment response. These findings underscore the utility of metabolomics to identify biomarkers for monitoring disease progression, assessing postsurgical recovery, and improving our understanding of PPGL pathophysiology."

PhenoAge was calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers (albumin, creatinine, glucose, C-reactive protein, lymphocyte%, mean cell volume, red blood cell distribution width, alkaline phosphatase, and white blood cell count). PhenoAgeAccel was derived as residuals from linear regression of PhenoAge on chronological age.

    "text": "Proper brain function relies on an adequate supply of energy - mainly glucose - to power neuronal activity. Delivery of this nutrient to the neuropil is mediated by the Glucose Transporter1 (GLUT1) protein. Perturbing glucose supply to the brain is profoundly damaging and exemplified by the neurodevelopmental disorder, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS). Resulting from haploinsufficiency of the SLC2A1 (GLUT1) gene, GLUT1DS is characterized by intractable infantile-onset seizures and a disabling movement disorder. Ketogenic diets, which supply the brain with an alternate energy source, ketone bodies, are currently the preferred therapeutic option for Glut1DS patients but do not address the underlying cause - low brain glucose - of the disease. One intuitively appealing therapeutic strategy that does, involves restoring GLUT1 levels to the patient brain. Here, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of the human GLUT1 genomic locus in a mouse model of GLUT1DS raises brain GLUT1 levels and reduces disease burden. Augmenting GLUT1 levels in mutants correspondingly raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose levels, improved motor performance and reduced the frequency of seizures characteristically observed in GLUT1DS. Interestingly, the increased GLUT1 in mutants harboring the human GLUT1 locus was at least partly the result of an increase in murine Slc2a1 (Glut1) activity, most likely the effect of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) embedded in the human transgene. Collectively, our work has not only shown that repleting human GLUT1 mitigates GLUT1DS but also has yielded transgenic mice that constitute a useful tool to test and optimize clinically promising agents designed to stimulate this gene for therapeutic purposes."

    "text": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is a progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by homozygous loss of the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, leading to reduced SMN protein expression. Increasing evidence implicates neurotransmission deficits in the pathophysiology of SMA. In particular, alterations in neuroactive amino acids involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission have recently been identified in both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of SMApatients and the spinal cord of SMNΔ7 mouse models. L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, plays a critical role in glutamatergic receptor signalling, influencing neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. However, it remains unclear whether SMN deficiency affects L-arginine metabolism in SMA. To address this, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to investigate whether SMN deficiency alters L-arginine homeostasis in the central nervous system of SMNΔ7 mice and in the CSF of SMA patients with varying disease severity, both before and after treatment with the SMN-inducing therapy Nusinersen. Notably, we observed significantly reduced L-arginine levels in the brainstem and spinal cord of symptomatic SMA mice compared to age-matched wild-type littermates. Consistent with these findings, we revealed lower L-arginine levels in severe SMA1 patients compared to milder SMA2 and SMA3 patients and healthy controls, enhancing the translational strength of our findings. Importantly, Nusinersen-mediated SMN upregulation fully restored L-arginine homeostasis in the CSF of severe SMA1 patients. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a dysregulation of L-arginine in SMA and highlight a role for SMN-enhancing therapies in restoring neurochemical alterations observed in patients with this neurodegenerative disease."

RNA-Seq analysis of colon tissues and UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS phytochemical profiling were integrated with functional validation using erastin-induced ferroptosis in Caco-2 cells. Virtual docking, molecular interactions, and gene-editing were employed for mechanistic investigation.\n\nRESULTS: PHE administration significantly attenuated DSS-induced weight loss and disease activity index elevation, while preserving intestinal mucosal integrity. Transcriptomic analysis and in vivo experiments revealed PHE's regulation of glutathione metabolic pathways and ferroptosis. The flavonoids in PHE, especially aromadendrin, were identified as the primary active component binding to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1(KEAP1)'s Kelch domain, thereby activating Nrf2 signaling and upregulating glutathione (GSH) synthesis genes. Nrf2 ablation or KEAP1 over-expression abolished PHE's protective effects, confirming pathway specificity.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings establish that PHE exerts anti-colitis effects through KEAP1/Nrf2/GSH axis-mediated ferroptosis inhibition, with aromadendrin serving as the key bioactive compound.

We provide an overview of selected applications and concepts that have had a significant impact on life science research, and some that have also led to significant commercial implications. In the 1980s, the SpA promoter and signal sequence were utilized in Escherichia coli for recombinant production of various proteins, yielding product secretion to the culture medium and thereby simplifying product recovery. The five homologous Ig-binding domains of SpA gained tremendous interest in the late 1980s, largely due to the rise of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for therapeutic use, prompting a growing demand for effective affinity ligands to facilitate their purification. Over the years, these Ig-binding domains have been extensively investigated and re-engineered to bind proteins other than antibodies, leading in the mid-1990s to the development of the affibody affinity protein technology. Today, affibody molecules are being investigated in late-stage clinical trials as potential protein therapeutics for various indications. Finally, the cell wall anchoring regions of SpA inspired the development of a surface display system for Staphylococcus carnosus, which has emerged as a technology platform in combinatorial protein engineering for work with large peptide, antibody and affibody libraries."

However, targeted metabolomics studies of serum amino acids in silicosis patients remain limited. Herein, we developed a specific serum amino acid metabolomics assay for identifying differential amino acids as biomarkers, providing a sensitive and reliable basis for diagnosing silicosis. A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous quantification of 21 amino acids in serum was established by optimizing chromatographic and sample preparation conditions. The method validation results showed good linearity (r > 0.99), recovery (78.3 %-128.4 %) and precision (1.27 %-13.01 %). The developed method was utilized to detect the levels of 21 amino acids in the serum of the silicosis patient group (SP; n = 104) and the healthy control group (HC; n = 118). The concentration of four amino acids (glutamate, arginine, aspartic acid and ornithine) was significantly different between the SP and the HC. Single diagnostic biomarkers exhibited area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.712 to 0.892, while the glutamate-arginine combination achieved superior performance (AUC = 0.915, 86.1 % sensitivity, 90.0 % specificity). The aforementioned results indicate that four biomarkers were screened for the diagnosis of silicosis, with glutamate emerging as the most accurate single biomarker for predicting silicosis. The diagnostic performance was further enhanced by combining glutamate with arginine, which improved both sensitivity and specificity."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a prevalent neurological condition marked by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs, which often disrupts sleep and impairs quality of life. Although neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes have been implicated, the roles of serum glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in treatment-naïve RLS remain unclear.\n\nMETHODS: In this case-control study, 108 treatment-naïve RLS patients and 90 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Serum levels of GFAP, BDNF, and NfL were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Symptom severity and quality of life were assessed using the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group Rating Scale (IRLS) and the RLS Quality of Life Questionnaire (QoL-RLS), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate biomarker associations with disease risk. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to assess the discriminative ability of serum GFAP, BDNF, and NfL levels in differentiating RLS patients from controls. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to evaluate diagnostic performance.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to controls, RLS patients had significantly higher serum levels of GFAP (148.27 ± 32.53 vs. 96.44 ± 27.81 pg/mL, p < 0.001) and NfL (15.35 ± 4.82 vs. 9.78 ± 3.59 pg/mL, p < 0.001), and lower levels of BDNF (18.71 ± 5.69 vs. 23.95 ± 6.12 pg/mL, p = 0.002). Multivariate analyses confirmed these markers as independent predictors of RLS (GFAP: OR = 1.592, BDNF: OR = 0.372, NfL: OR = 1.953, all p < 0.01). NfL was positively correlated with both IRLS (β = 0.531, p = 0.012) and QoL-RLS scores (β = 0.356, p = 0.007), while GFAP was associated with QoL impairment (β = 0.724, p < 0.001), and BDNF showed a negative association with symptom severity (β = -0.287, p = 0.003). ROC analyses showed strong discriminative power for GFAP (AUC = 0.919), NfL (AUC = 0.856), and BDNF (AUC = 0.797).\n\nCONCLUSION: Serum GFAP, BDNF, and NfL are independently associated with RLS presence and severity, highlighting their potential as peripheral biomarkers of neuroglial and axonal dysfunction. These findings provide mechanistic insight and support their utility in the diagnosis and monitoring of RLS and may serve as peripheral indicators of neurobiological involvement and could have potential utility in future research related to disease monitoring or treatment response."

    "text": "In cancer therapeutics, protein-metal binding mechanisms critically govern the pharmacokinetics and targeting efficacy of drugs, thereby fundamentally shaping the rational design of anticancer metallodrugs. While conventional laboratory methods used to study such mechanisms are often costly, low throughput, and limited in capturing dynamic biological processes, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative. Despite increasing efforts to develop protein-metal binding datasets and ML algorithms, the application of ML in tumor protein-metal binding remains limited. Key challenges include a shortage of high-quality, tumor-specific datasets, insufficient consideration of multiple data modalities, and the complexity of interpreting results due to the \"black box\" nature of complex ML models. This paper summarizes recent progress and ongoing challenges in using ML to predict tumor protein-metal binding, focusing on data, modeling, and interpretability. We present multimodal protein-metal binding datasets and outline strategies for acquiring, curating, and preprocessing them for training ML models. Moreover, we explore the complementary value provided by different data modalities and examine methods for their integration. We also review approaches for improving model interpretability to support more trustworthy decisions in cancer research. Finally, we offer our perspective on research opportunities and propose strategies to address the scarcity of tumor protein data and the limited number of predictive models for tumor protein-metal binding. We also highlight two promising directions for effective metal-based drug design: integrating protein-protein interaction data to provide structural insights into metal-binding events and predicting structural changes in tumor proteins after metal binding."

In intestine, tryptophan is metabolized primarily by the kynurenine pathway, which is regulated by the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). Tryptophan flow into the kynurenine pathway limits its availability for the formation of microbiota-derived indole derivatives including butyrate, and limits availability of tryptophan for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) pathway. Feeding Ldlr-/- mice a high-fat high-cholesterol diet (HFD+HCD) increased intestinal IDO1 activity, decreased levels of tryptophan, fecal butyrate, and 5-HT. Ldlr-/- mice deficient in intestinal Ido1  ( Ldlr-/-Ido1-/- ) on HFD+HCD had increased intestinal levels of 5-HT, increased gut permeability, increased gut inflammation, increased LPS, and increased aortic atherosclerosis. Ldlr-/- mice fed HFD+HCD and treated with a 5-HT pathway inhibitor had increased fecal indole levels, improved gut-barrier, increased antimicrobial peptide levels, and decreased aortic atherosclerosis without a change in plasma cholesterol.\n\nSUMMARY: These studies demonstrate the importance of microbiota-derived products and intestinal tryptophan metabolism in atherosclerosis."

Our prior in vivo studies demonstrated that the absence of lipocalin prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) leads to the development of fatty liver disease, and L-PGDS expression significantly decreased when C57BL/6 mice were kept on a high-fat diet. Briefly, L-PGDS belongs to the arachidonic acid pathway and enzymatically isomerizes prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2, which imparts pharmacological effects via two receptors called DP1 and DP2. L-PGDS is an essential key player in fatty liver disease, but its mechanistic regulation still remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to study the mechanistic regulation of L-PGDS using a palmitate-induced cellular MASLD model. We successfully recapitulated the MASLD phenotype in HepG2 cells with palmitate treatment. Our results showed significant lipid accumulation and increased lipidassociated protein and gene expression, along with palmitate concentration-dependent L-PGDS downregulation. To study the L-PGDS downregulation, we employed MG132, chloroquine, and cycloheximide to assess proteasomal degradation, autophagy, and translational activity, respectively. Our gene and protein expression data suggested the possible reason for L-PGDS downregulation via inhibiting transcription and subsequently translation. Additionally, our autophagy results also showed a role in LPGDS downregulation. In summary, it can be concluded that palmitate treatment downregulated L-PGDS, possibly involving transcription-translation and/or autophagy pathways. However, further studies are needed to delineate the precise molecular mechanism and apply this knowledge to MASLD pathogenesis and treatment."

    "text": "As the demand for functional foods and precision nutrition continues to rise, there is an urgent need for advanced delivery systems that improve the stability, bioavailability, and targeted release of sensitive bioactive compounds. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), commonly found in fermented foods, have taken on a dual role-as both passive encapsulation targets and active delivery carriers-forming a conceptual basis for the development of next-generation food delivery systems. This review examines the interactions between LAB and various food-grade encapsulation materials including proteins (such as whey protein, casein, zein), polysaccharides (like alginate, chitosan), and lipids (such as liposomes, W/O/W emulsions), highlighting roles of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, covalent cross-linking, and interfacial self-assembly. Moreover, four emerging LAB-based delivery systems are classified: (i) surface adsorption via non-covalent interactions, (ii) intracellular loading driven by membrane transport or biosynthesis, (iii) co-encapsulation in hydrogels and emulsions, as well as (iv) engineered LAB capable of in situ synthesis and targeted release. The review also summarizes practical applications in hydrocolloid-rich food systems, such as yogurt, plant-based gels, and functional beverages. These applications highlight LAB's contribution to enhancing structural stability, controlled release, and nutritional functionality. Finally, key challenges are discussed, including the limited compatibility between encapsulating materials and food matrices, insufficient understanding of the interactions between exopolysaccharides and interfaces, and the need for in vivo validation. Based on these insights, future directions are proposed to guide the rational design of next-generation LAB-based delivery systems for precision nutrition and functional food innovation."

This study focuses on NLRP3 expressed in circulatory immune cells, to elucidate the systemic level significance of NLRP3 inflammasome in contributing to diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression. We therefore, aim to investigate the mRNA expression signature of genes encoding the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in circulatory immune cells and its association with severity of DKD in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients.\n\nMATERIALS & METHODS: PBMCs were isolated from the blood samples of 160 T2DM patients presenting with varying grades of DKD severity. RNA extracted from the PBMCs was used for relative quantification of our target genes using SYBRGreen real-time RT-qPCR. Association of DKD progression with NLRP3 component genes' mRNA expression was analyzed statistically.\n\nRESULTS: Expression of NLRP3, CASP1, and IL1β mRNAs were significantly elevated in DKD; higher HSP72 mRNA expression accompanied normoalbuminuric T2DM. PBMC-derived NLRP3 mRNA levels correlated positively with circulatory monocyte population. Plasma NLRP3 protein and NLRP3 mRNA expressed in PBMCs were associated inversely with decreasing eGFR, independent of diabetes duration, age and sex. Contrastingly, HSP72 mRNA levels declined with decline in eGFR. No association between NLRP3 complex genes and HSP72 mRNA expression in PBMCs was observed, although HSP72 exhibited inverse characteristics to that of NLRP3 complex in the study.\n\nCONCLUSION: A dynamic interplay exists between DKD progression and PBMC-derived mRNA expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and HSP72. At the systemic level, while NLRP3 exasperates inflammation, the protective role of HSP72 is extinguished. Their expression patterns in circulatory immune cells are associated with eGFR decline, tying systemic inflammatory state to worsening kidney disease outcomes."

In this study, we investigate the interplay between adipokines, cytokines and complement proteins in lupus nephritis patients.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment naïve renal biopsy proven (2003 ISN/RPS) LN patients (n = 72) and healthy volunteers (n = 65) were enrolled (January 2017-January 2021). Serum adipokines, cytokines, complement proteins, C- reactive protein, Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) profile, anti-dsDNA antibodies and anti-phospholipid antibody (APA) profile were estimated using immunoassay. Serum C3 and C4 levels were measured by nephelometer.\n\nRESULTS: Elevated adiponectin, adipsin, resistin, progranulin, galectin-3 and pentraxin-3 levels and reduced leptin levels were seen in LN patients when compared to healthy controls (p < 0.05). Serum IL-1β, INFγ, IL-6 and MCP-1 levels were significantly elevated whereas IL-4 levels were prominently reduced in LN patients when compared with healthy controls (p < 0.05). Serum C1q and CFP levels were significantly reduced in LN patients (p < 0.05). Elevated pentraxin-3 levels directly correlated with long disease duration and high SLEDAI score (p < 0.05). Declining renal function parameters strongly correlated with raised adiponectin, adipsin and resistin levels (p < 0.05). Adipsin levels positively correlated with complement components C3, C4 and CFB levels (p < 0.05). The PCA of serum proteins in LN patients identified three distinct clusters comprising of 37 (Cluster1), 24 (Cluster2) and 1 (Cluster3) patients in each. Adiponectin, resistin and CRP levels were found to be elevated in patients belonging to Cluster1. On the contrary, MCP1 levels were raised in Cluster2 LN patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: The association of raised resistin, adipsin, pentraxin-3 levels with deteriorating renal function is suggestive of their potential role in LN pathogenesis. The association between adipokines and complement components indicates the regulatory role of adipokines on complements and vice versa. The identification of patient clusters based on serum protein profile indicated involvement of unique biological profiles in diverse LN pathogenesis mechanism."

However, their clinical potential is often limited by instability under physiological conditions, primarily due to exonucleolytic degradation and structural flexibility. To address these challenges in a model system, we designed a circular RNA aptamer targeting the HIV-1 Tat protein. Enzymatic circularization of the aptamer was performed using T4 RNA ligase, and circularization was confirmed by mobility shift assays and RNase R digestion. Binding affinity was assessed via filter dot blot assay, while structural stability was evaluated using 1D imino proton NMR and CLEANEX-PM experiments. Intracellular stability was monitored using in-cell NMR following transfection into HeLa cells. In our study, the circular aptamer showed approximately tenfold higher binding affinity compared to its linear counterpart, as determined by filter binding assay. NMR analysis indicated improved structural rigidity, preservation of native base pairing, and reduced solvent exchange. Notably, in-cell NMR revealed that the circular aptamer remained detectable up to 18 h post-transfection, whereas the linear aptamer degraded within a few hours. In this system, circularization substantially improved the binding performance and intracellular persistence of the RNA aptamer. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of applying RNA circularization to enhance aptamer functionality in living cells and lay the groundwork for future therapeutic exploration."

PS and falls are prevalent in aging populations, yet their combined impact on long-term stroke risk remains underexplored, particularly in Asian cohorts. This study investigates the association between fall history and incident stroke among middle-aged and older Chinese adults with PS.\n\nMETHODS: Using longitudinal data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS, 2015-2018), we analyzed 4605 participants with PS (mean age: 64.8 years). Fall history was assessed by self-reported response to \"Have you fallen in the past two years?\" Stroke was physician-diagnosed via self-report. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models evaluated stroke risk, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes), and biomarkers (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP]). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses assessed robustness.\n\nRESULTS: Stroke incidence was 9.3 % among fallers and 6.7 % among non-fallers, with a P-value of 0.036. Participants with fall history exhibited a 37 % higher risk of incident stroke compared to non-fallers (adjusted OR: 1.37, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.84). The association remained consistent across age, sex, BMI, and most comorbidity subgroups, except for dyslipidemia (interaction P = 0.022). Sensitivity analyses, including multiple imputation for missing data, exclusion of adults >80 years, and removal of hip fracture cases, consistently confirmed the robustness of the findings.\n\nCONCLUSION: Fall history independently predicts stroke risk in individuals with PS, highlighting the potential of fall prevention to reduce stroke burden in this population. This study provides novel evidence of a prolonged stroke risk trajectory in Asian PS cohorts, complementing Western studies focused on short-term post-fall risks. The study has several limitations. Self-reported falls may introduce recall bias and lack mechanistic details. Unmeasured confounders such as diet and medication use constrain causal interpretation. Data constraints prevented differentiation between stroke subtypes."

At 96 h, biofilm matrix components (exoproteins, eDNA, and carbohydrates) and microbial viability (confocal microscopy and PMA-qPCR) were quantified. Relative gene expression analysis was also conducted with species-specific genes (gtfB, sagP, arcA, argG, argH).\n\nRESULTS: For carbohydrates, no significant difference was identified among treatment groups (p>0.05). Protein content for 0.5 % Arg+LRG was significantly lower than LRG (p<0.05). The lowest eDNA content was observed in LRG (p<0.05); while eDNA content of 0.5 % Arg+LRG, was similar to 0.5 % Arg and control (p>0.05). Using confocal imaging, the highest proportion of live cell was found in 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05), followed by 0.25 % Arg+LRG, 3-D biofilm imaging demonstrated increased biomass with smoother architecture in biofilms treated with 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05). 0.5 % Arg+LRG significantly enhanced growth of commensal streptococci (S. gordonii, S. sanguinis) compared to monotherapies and control, while also reducing viability of S. mutans compared to control (p<0.05). Gene expression analysis revealed downregulation of S. mutans virulence (gtfB) and upregulation of commensal metabolism (sagP, arcA) for 0.5 % Arg+LRG (p<0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: The 0.5 % Arg+LRG synbiotics uniquely integrates ecological modulation by regulating biochemical matrix components, promoting commensal enrichment and suppressing cariogenic pathogens.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: A deliverable Arg-LRG synbiotics for caries prevention addresses a global public health priority. This strategy aligns with microbial homeostasis principles, presenting a novel paradigm for caries prevention. The Arg-LRG synbiotics can counter the limitations of fluorides to establish a diverse oral microbiome, imparting an ecologically driven approach to caries prevention."

Despite the fatality it could cause, no antiviral treatment is currently available to treat the disease and its associated pathophysiological conditions. This study aimed to search drug-like compounds for possible inhibitors of the NS5 protein of dengue virus (serotype 2). In the present study, a data set of twenty-five Beta vulgaris. L-based phytoconstituents was developed. We employed machine learning (ML) data pre-processing, screening of differentially expressed transcripts and genes, identification of common transcriptional signatures and pathways and function enrichment analysis of dengue infection; and protein-protein interaction network construction and identification of hub genes. ML data revealed that NS5 mRNA was downregulated by betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside. Moreover, administering these compounds can alleviate host innate immune factor suppression mediated by NS5, thereby exhibiting antiviral activity. Molecular docking and pharmacokinetics studies revealed a potential therapeutic role of betanin, kaempferol, quercetin hydrate, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside phytoconstituents as potent antiviral phytocompounds. MD simulation and post-simulation analysis, including principal component analysis and dynamic cross-correlation, confirmed the antiviral therapeutic potency of betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside against dengue virus infection. In vitro cytotoxic studies also depicted nontoxic effects of betanin and quercetin hydrate in Vero and CHO cells at a concentration range of 20-0.31 μM. In summary, computational screening and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis revealed that betanin, kaempferol, and isovitexin-2-O-xyloside may prove as potential drug candidates against dengue virus regarding their possible safety and antiviral activity in future."

We analyze the current understanding of HDCA biosynthesis, highlighting species-specific differences and challenges in identifying HDCA-producing bacteria. The study evaluated the signaling mechanism by which HDCA simultaneously activates intestinal G protein-coupled bile acid receptor 1 (TGR5) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR), challenging the traditional paradigm of bile acid （BA）signaling. We assess HDCA's immunomodulatory effects, particularly its Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibition, and discuss potential therapeutic applications in metabolic diseases and sepsis. The review addresses challenges in translating rodent studies to human applications and explores future directions, including the development of HDCA derivatives and integration with microbiome modulation strategies. Ethical and regulatory considerations for microbiome-derived therapeutics are also discussed. We propose that HDCA research may catalyze paradigm shifts in understanding host-microbiome-BA interactions, calling for interdisciplinary approaches to harness its potential fully."

Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) is a vital tool for identifying druggable targets in skeletal muscle to develop T2DM treatments.\n\nMETHODS: Potential causative genetic factors in skeletal muscle and blood causally associated with T2DM were identified by SMR analysis. Bayesian colocalisation were used to validate causality. Pleiotropic impact of drug targets was assessed using phenome-wide MR (Phe-MR). Then, targeted overexpression or knockdown of AEBP1 in mouse myoblast cell lines (C2C12) and human skeletal muscle cells (HSkMCs) further validated the functional phenotype. Protein docking, co-IP and SPR were used to demonstrate protein-protein interactions.\n\nRESULTS: Both European and Asian populations revealed that AEBP1 was significantly associated with T2DM and its glycemic profile in blood and skeletal muscle, and was identified as a risk factor. Co-localisation analyses suggest that AEBP1 and T2DM originate from the same genetic variants. Meanwhile, targeted AEBP1 therapy has no potential adverse effects. Furthermore, AEBP1 was significantly expressed in in vivo and in vitro IR models and was consistent with the SMR results. Overexpression of AEBP1 further impaired insulin signalling and glucose transport mechanisms, exacerbating skeletal muscle IR. Targeting AEBP1 knockdown reversed these changes. Protein interaction experiments revealed that PI3K (p110β) is a direct target protein for AEBP1 to exert molecular functions.\n\nCONCLUSION: Targeting AEBP1 therapy is expected to be a pivotal approach for the prevention and treatment of T2DM."

(Xuta) is a new crop whose seed kernels are rich in high-quality proteins and fat; however, they contain antinutrients such as trypsin inhibitors, phytic acid and lectins. Hydrothermal treatment has been shown to significantly reduce these antinutritional factors, leading to the recent approval of Xuta kernels for human consumption by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Despite this, current scientific information is limited, for example, data on the potential genotoxicity of Xuta kernels. In this study, aqueous extracts from three Xuta cultivars were assessed for mutagenicity using the bacterial reverse mutation assay and genotoxicity using the Comet assay with human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Additionally, key antinutritional factors such as lectin activity, trypsin inhibitor activity, and phytic acid content were determined. Hydrothermal treatment significantly reduced antinutritional factors, with lectin activity being completely absent. The results show that the Xuta cultivars tested have no mutagenic or genotoxic potential and are suitable for human consumption after hydrothermal treatment. These findings support the introduction of Xuta kernels as an alternative protein source. Future research should focus on technofunctional properties and applications of Xuta proteins."

This study investigated the roles of phenylalanine (Phe) and cholesterol metabolism in BLCA chemoresistance using integrated omics and computational modeling. Transcriptomic analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets revealed that elevated hexokinase 2 (HK2) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression correlates with poor response to cisplatin. Mechanistically, Phe catabolism via phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activated mTORC1 signaling, promoting glycolysis and drug efflux, while cholesterol biosynthesis driven by SREBP2 enhanced ABCG2 transporter activity. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses confirmed causal associations between Phe/cholesterol metabolism and chemoresistance risk. Pharmacological inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase or dietary phenylalanine restriction sensitized BLCA cells to cisplatin both in vitro and in xenograft models. Overexpression of FOLH1 or F7 reversed the inhibitory effects of Phe or cholesterol targeting, respectively, confirming their functional roles in resistance. These findings identify FOLH1 and F7 as mediators of metabolic resistance in BLCA and suggest metabolic targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy. However, whether combined inhibition of Phe and cholesterol pathways provides synergistic benefits over monotherapy remains to be determined in future studies."

This study prepared carboxymethyl starch (CMS)-whey protein isolate (WPI) crosslinked complexes (CMS-WPI/TA) by regulating the interaction in the CMS-WPI system by tannin (TA), and explored the effects of the complexes on the secretion of satiety hormones. The results showed that after the addition of TA, the interaction in CMS-WPI system shifted from electrostatic interactions to hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions, forming more compact, uniform, and ordered TA-crosslinked complexes. In vitro simulated digestion results indicated that the digestion rates of CMS and WPI in CMS-WPI/TA2 in the upper gastrointestinal tract were reduced to 5.77 % and 26.33 %, respectively, thus permitting most of the CMS and WPI to reach the colon and be degraded by the gut microbiota into short-chain fatty acids, peptides, and amino acids. These metabolic products can stimulate the sustained secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) by L cells, with their secretion increased by 101.02 % and 106.30 % compared to the blank group, respectively. The TA-crosslinked complexes also increased the abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria such as Dialister and Blautia, and reduced the abundance of harmful gut microbiota such as Collinsella. The results of this study provide new insights into regulating starch-protein interactions to improve their resistance to digestion and contribute to the development of functional foods that are beneficial to the human gut microbiota and enhance satiety."

This review summarizes the current knowledge on the impact of the intestinal barrier on UC. The relationship between gut microbiota and the intestinal barrier in UC is also examined. Importantly, this review highlights the advances in the understanding of microbiota-mediated the Trp-AhR pathway in repairing the intestinal barrier. Furthermore, the potential influence of dietary proteins/peptides targeting gut microbiota to regulate the Trp-AhR pathway and alleviate intestinal barrier dysfunction in UC, and the effect of food processing on dietary proteins/peptides to influence gut microbiota and Trp metabolism are discussed. Dietary proteins/peptides could alleviate intestinal barrier impairment in UC by modulating the gut microbiota-mediated Trp-AhR pathway."

The sensory acceptability of bread was not significantly compromised by alfalfa flour inclusion since alterations in protein secondary structure were minor according to FTIR analysis contributing to the maintenance of desirable bread quality. The alfalfa flour quantity had the strongest influence on the content of the investigated nutrients. ASC inclusion was more favourable regarding bread's antioxidant properties compared to GASC, while the usage of sourdough had a positive effect on bread's palatability compared to the standard bread-making process.

This study investigated the changes in gel properties, endogenous enzyme activities, flavor characteristics and metabolic profile during mechanical pre-dehydration of minced fish, compared to the traditional washing process, in order to understand the relationship between changes in endogenous components and processing quality. The results showed that the pre-dehydration process preserved some of the TGase activities (65.96 U/mg) but also some of the proteases and some metabolites (e.g. Histamine and Phosphatidylcholine) that are detrimental to the gelling process, and the gel strength of the obtained surimi gels was lower but acceptable than that of the washed surimi gels (390.97 g·cm and 464.51 g·cm). The gel strength of unwashed surimi was unacceptable (284.03 g·cm). Pre-dehydrated surimi preserved higher levels of amino acids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids than washed surimi, leading to enhanced flavor precursor retention and generation of volatile compounds during gelling. Compared to washed surimi gel, pre-dehydrated surimi gels exhibited stronger warm-over and fishy flavor (Heptanal, Octanal, et al), while retaining more desirable aromas (3-Hexanone, 1-hexanol, et al).

FA primer was prepared by mixing ethyl acetate and ethanol as a binary solvent system at solvent ratios of 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, and 4:6. The optimal ratio of ethyl acetate to ethanol was determined by measuring the degree of conversion (DC) and contact angle, combining the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) and fracture pattern immediately and 10,000 thermocycles. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) activities and adhesive infiltration at the interface were observed, whereas scanning electron microscopy was used to further evaluate nanoleakage and resin rags.\n\nRESULTS: Application of the primer containing a mixed EAC:ET-4:6 solvent resulted in a significant enhancement in the µTBS of both immediate and aging groups, and the contact angle of the demineralized dentin surface. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) were further observed the infiltration properties of resin rags in the bonding interface were strengthened. The MMPs activities in the hybrid layer was clearly inhibited, and the degree of nanoleakage at the bonding interface reduced remarkably, thus, it improved the stability and durability of the bond.\n\nCONCLUSION: FA primers containing appropriate ratios of ethanol and ethyl acetate solvents can simplify operation procedures, enhances collagen fiber resistance to enzymatic degradation, and improves hybrid layer sealing, thereby increasing bonding strength.\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The FA primer formulated with an ethyl acetate-ethanol mixed solvent aim to achieve high-strength, low leakage, and long-term durable adhesive effects, demonstrating dual functional advantages: Effective collagen crosslinking capacity leading to enhanced bond durability and reduced secondary caries incidence, alongside decreased technique sensitivity. These findings provide novel perspectives for FA primer applications in clinical practice."

These findings demonstrate that TDCPP aggravates PD neurodegeneration through dual mechanisms: ferroptosis-linked oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.

TGFβ1-treated H-dMVECs underwent significant changes in cell morphology, with loss of endothelial markers (i.e., CD31 and VE-cadherin) and a concomitant increase in the expression of mesenchymal/myofibroblast markers (i.e., α-smooth muscle actin, type I collagen, and S100A4/fibroblast-specific protein 1) and of EndMT-associated transcription factors (Snail1, Twist1, and Zeb1).

    "text": "Sodium valproate (VPA), a widely used antiepileptic drug with good safety profile since many decades. It has increasingly demonstrated therapeutic potential in treating neurological disorders and offering neuroprotection. However, there are neurotoxic properties, underscoring its complex pharmacological profile. VPA works by boosting GABA, the brain's main inhibitory neurotransmitter to reduce nerve excitability and prevent seizures. In bipolar disorder, VPA stabilizes mood by modulating intracellular signaling pathways, including inhibition of histone deacetylases and modulation of G-protein-coupled receptor systems, which influence mood regulation and neuronal plasticity. VPA also prevents migraines by blocking sodium channels and pausing the brain wave disruptions that trigger migraine attacks. Emerging preclinical data suggest that VPA also plays a broader role in promoting neuronal survival, enhancing neuroplasticity, and protecting against neurodegenerative processes. However, despite its therapeutic efficacy, VPA's broad spectrum of action is accompanied by potential neurotoxicities. Chronic use of VPA is associated with adverse effects, including cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and motor dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, excessive inhibition of histone deacetylase, imbalance in neurotransmitters and altered expression of neurotrophic factors are attributed to valproate-induced neurotoxicity. This review explores the neuroprotective effects as well as neurotoxic effects, with a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse roles. Additionally, we discuss the challenges behind the failure of preclinical neuroprotective data to translate into successful clinical trials. This review aims to provide valuable insights for preclinical researchers designing future studies on VPA."

    "text": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a metabolite generated through the cooperation of gut microbiota and liver, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that TMAO promotes lipid deposition in both in vivo and in vitro models. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice, the conversion of TMA to TMAO was increased, and supplementation with TMAO exacerbated lipid accumulation and liver dysfunction. In contrast, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3)-Sh alleviated hepatic steatosis in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis identified heat shock protein 90β (HSP90β) as a potential downstream effector of TMAO. In both HepG2 cells and HFD-fed mice, TMAO upregulated HSP90β expression, perturbing protein homeostasis. FMO3 Sh reduced HSP90β protein activity and mRNA levels. Meanwhile, proteomic analysis revealed that the TMAO/HSP90β axis disrupts mitochondrial protein homeostasis, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by MPTP opening, MMP decrease, and ROS production. In vivo, activation of the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis aggravated mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by swollen mitochondria with reduced cristae observed via TEM. Notably, FMO3 Sh ameliorated mitochondrial function by suppressing the TMAO/HSP90β axis. In summary, our study demonstrates that the FMO3/TMAO/HSP90β axis promotes MAFLD progression by targeting mitochondrial protein homeostasis and influencing lipid metabolism."

    "text": "The alpha subtype of the estrogen receptor (ERα) plays a crucial role in breast cancer as a target for endocrine therapy. Fulvestrant, developed by AstraZeneca as the first selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs), effectively downregulates ER levels by reducing its stability, which leads to degradation through protein degradation mechanisms. However, the administration of Fulvestrant via the intramuscular route has imposed significant limitations on its clinical application, prompting the exploration of active oral bioavailable SERDs. Furthermore, research institutes and pharmaceutical companies have evaluated the efficacy of various oral SERDs in terms of their ability to degrade the ER, binding capacity, safety profiles, and numerous other indicators. This paper reviews recent advancements in oral SERDs, discusses their evolutionary relationships, and outlines the processes of structural modification, providing valuable insights for future research and applications."

These nutritional interventions can improve functional recovery for neurosurgical and neurocritically ill patients.\n\nRECENT FINDINGS: Malnutrition is a major risk factor for adverse outcomes in neurosurgery and neurocritically ill patients. Advancements in preoperative fasting guidelines have shifted towards more flexible approaches, such as allowing clear liquids up to 2 h before surgery and encouraging carbohydrate loading before elective surgery to improve glucose regulation and recovery. Prehabilitation strategies, including protein-rich nutrition and physical activity, improve postoperative recovery, particularly in frail patients. In the neurocritically ill, early enteral nutrition (EN) with low-to-moderate protein and calorie targets improves functional recovery and reduces complications. Recent studies challenge the necessity of prolonged fasting before extubation and ICU procedures. Despite evidence supporting reduced fasting, adherence to protocols remains low.\n\nSUMMARY: Advances in perioperative fasting protocols will likely improve recovery for neurosurgical patients. Early EN improves outcomes in neurocritically ill patients, while excessive calorie and protein intake may be detrimental. Addressing implementation barriers remains crucial for optimizing nutrition in neurocritical care."

    "text": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression is predominantly attributed to podocyte injury. However, the underlying mechanisms remain inadequately understood. DKD patients exhibit elevated lactate concentrations due to impaired glucose metabolism. Lactate serves as a substrate for a post-translational modification known as lactylation, which is integral to numerous cellular processes. The study aimed to explore the potential role of lactylation in DKD podocyte injury and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The results showed that lactate concentrations were elevated in the plasma of DKD patients, as well as in the serum and renal tissue of diabetic mice. High glucose (HG) resulted in increased lactate accumulation in podocytes, exacerbated podocyte injury and promoted protein lactylation. Protein modification omics demonstrated that LARS1 lactylation was enhanced, specifically at the K970 site, which further aggravated podocyte injury by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis. In vivo transfection with LARS1 siRNA significantly improved renal function and mitigated podocyte injury. Our study identified a novel mechanism linking LARS1 lactylation activity to compromised podocyte autophagy, heightened podocyte injury, and the onset of proteinuria within DKD."

    "text": "Cancer is a metabolic disease influenced by diet, diet-related nutrients, the tumor microenvironment, and metabolic signaling, all of which can significantly affect cancer progression. Although ketogenic diet (KD) has gained attention for its potential therapeutic effects in cancer, the relationship between KD, cancer biology, and metabolic signaling remains underexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of KD on lung cancer biology using an in vivo model developed with AAV and CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in mice fed either a KD or high-carbohydrate diet (HCD). RNA-seq analysis revealed that KD markedly upregulated expression of Cytochrome P450 Family 1 Subfamily A Member 1 (CYP1A1) in lung cancer tissues compared to HCD. Protein analysis confirmed increased CYP1A1 levels under KD independently of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) protein levels. Similarly, in A549 and H460 human lung cancer cells treated with β-hydroxybutyrate and low-glucose conditions mimicking KD, CYP1A1 expression was also elevated. Interestingly, we observed that CYP1A1 expression is dependent on AhR activity and nuclear translocation in A549 cells in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of CYP1A1 knockdown A549 cells indicated that CYP1A1 is crucial for regulating cell cycle genes, including cyclin D. These findings highlight the biological significance of CYP1A1 in KD-induced changes in lung cancer, suggesting its role in cell proliferation and tumor development. This study also provides insights into the metabolic signaling underlying the effects of KD on cancer, offering potential directions for future therapeutic strategies."

Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 2(GLIPR2) has been reported to be associated with EndoMT, but whether it can regulate cardiac fibrosis is unknown. This study aimed to explore the contribution of GLIPR2 to post-AMI fibrosis and its underlying mechanism.\n\nMETHODS: Serum protein levels of GLIPR2 were measured in patients with AMI. LAD ligation surgery was used to establish AMI animal models in C57BL/6 J mice. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-targeted knockdown of GLIPR2 was employed to investigate the effects of GLIPR2 on cardiac fibrosis, cardiac pumping function, and EndoMT after AMI in mice. In human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs), GLIPR2 overexpression and knockdown via lentivirus (LV) were utilized to examine angiogenesis, migration, proliferation, and EndoMT under hypoxic conditions.\n\nRESULTS: In the serum of AMI patients, GLIPR2 expression was significantly increased. In mice with AMI, GLIPR2 knockdown reversed EndoMT, attenuated heart fibrosis, and partially restored ventricular pumping function. In a hypoxic cell model, GLIPR2 overexpression enhanced cell proliferation, migration, neovascularization, and EndoMT, whereas GLIPR2 knockdown inhibited these processes. Furthermore, transcriptome sequencing and recovery studies identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-like protein (PDGFRL)/AKT/mTOR pathway as a critical regulator of GLIPR2-mediated EndoMT.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: GLIPR2 promotes cardiac fibrosis repair by regulating EndoMT through the PDGFRL/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Its inhibition represents a potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate cardiac fibrosis and improve ventricular function following AMI."

    "text": "The cost of cancer care globally is unsustainable and strategies to reduce the mounting burden of cancer are urgently needed. One approach is the use of preventive therapies to reduce cancer risk; dietary-derived compounds with good safety profiles represent a promising source of potential candidates but translating encouraging preclinical data to successful trials presents significant challenges. Development of curcumin, from the spice turmeric, as a preventive therapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is hindered by poor understanding of its mechanism of action. Using patient derived xenografts and ex-vivo 3D-models exposed to clinically achievable curcumin concentrations, we found that it targets proliferating cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) within premalignant adenoma and early-stage cancer tissues, with broad spectrum activity across all molecular subtypes. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that curcumin pushes CSCs towards differentiation over self-renewal, thereby inhibiting tumour development. Evidence suggests these effects involve direct protein binding of curcumin to NANOG, a master regulator of CRC CSCs, and impairment of its transcriptional activity via direct interference with NANOG-DNA binding. Furthermore, curcumin decreased the proportion of proliferating CSCs, defined by NANOG/Ki67 co-expression in patient derived explants and individuals with tumours containing a small fraction of these cells had greatly improved progression-free survival compared to those in the highest quartile for expression. The use of curcumin to minimise this cellular population may yield significant benefit and its clinical evaluation is warranted. Overall, this study provides crucial mechanistic insight, identifying patient populations likely to benefit from curcumin for prevention of sporadic CRC and theragnostic biomarkers for assessing efficacy."

This study aims to investigate whether the administration of IL-10 can suppress disease flares in ulcerative colitis (UC).\n\nMETHODS: A UC model was established in mice using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) to evaluate the therapeutic effect of IL-10. LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells were utilized to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on apoptosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress.\n\nRESULTS: IL-10 administration significantly alleviated clinical symptoms in DSS-induced colitis, including promoting body weight recovery, increasing colon length, and reducing disease activity index scores. IL-10 repaired the intestinal mucosal barrier by inhibiting apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, Interferon-γ, and IL-1β), and modulating oxidative stress markers, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells, IL-10 protected against apoptosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Bioinformatics analysis of control and IL-10 knockout mice showed a significant upregulation of Interferon-Stimulated Gene 15 (ISG15) after IL-10 knockout. In contrast, ISG15 expression was downregulated in the LPS + IL-10 group but upregulated in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that ISG15 is a target gene of IL-10 and plays a role in autophagy regulation. Furthermore, IL-10 enhanced autophagy by increasing the protein expression of ATG7, and the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, thereby reducing apoptosis and oxidative stress in Caco-2 cells. Autophagy inhibition with 3-Methyladenine or overexpression of ISG15 diminished IL-10's protective effects.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that IL-10 administration inhibits the progression of UC by activating autophagy and modulating ISG15 expression. In the future, targeted delivery of IL-10 to the intestinal lamina propria may enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic side effects."

The objective of this study was to assess the anti-wrinkle and anti-aging effects of Arazyme in skin keratinocytes and fibroblasts subjected to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation and oxidative stress. Keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and fibroblasts (CCD-986sk) were exposed to UVB (15 mJ/cm²) radiation or oxidative stress induced by 2 mM 2,2'-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), followed by treatment with Arazyme (0.1-0.5 μM) for 24 h. The effects of Arazyme were compared to those of individual treatments with papain, trypsin, or retinol, which served as reference compounds. Key parameters examined included the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13), collagen synthesis, and cellular senescence markers (LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53). Additionally, the impact of Arazyme on cellular signaling pathways, including ERK, JNK, and NF-κB, was assessed. Arazyme significantly suppressed UVB-induced expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-13 in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells compared to other treatments. In UVB-exposed fibroblasts, Arazyme reduced both mRNA and protein levels of MMPs, while also enhancing procollagen concentration and collagen gene expression. Furthermore, Arazyme inhibited the activation of ERK, JNK, and NF-κB signaling pathways in keratinocytes. In AAPH-stimulated HaCaT cells, Arazyme significantly attenuated the expression of senescence-related markers, including LMNB1, p16, p21, and p53, and decreased the proportion of senescence-positive cells in fibroblasts. Our in vitro findings suggest that Arazyme may help attenuate UVB- and oxidative stress-induced markers of skin aging, indicating its potential as a candidate for further investigation in anti-aging skincare research."

The aim of this study was to assess the protective effect of Qiukui Taoren Recipe (QT), and the potential molecular mechanisms in AKI using network pharmacology prediction, in vivo and in vitro experiment. There were 42 active components of QT detected by HPLC-Q-TOF/MS, and network pharmacology showed that these active components mainly could act with 63 core targets such as TNF-α, Caspase-3, BCL2, STAT3, PPARγ, and regulated 110 signaling pathways for alleviating AKI. In addition, QT reduced periocular oedema, renal malformations and size reduction, partially restore renal excretory function, and reduced the accumulation of proteinuria in zebrafish AKI model induced by caristolochic acid (AA). QT could upregulate the mRNA expression of Nephrin and oxidative stress genes (Nrf2, HO-1, PPARγ), and downregulate inflammation- and apoptosis-related genes (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, NF-κB, Caspase-3, P53). Furthermore, QT inhibited ROS elevation and apoptosis activated by cisplatin (CDDP) in HEK293T cells. Western blotting results showed that QT could enhance the protein expression of nephrin, and inhibited the protein expression of Kim-1, IL-18, NLRP3, STAT3, P53 and Caspase-3. Overall, these results indicated the protective effect of QT against AKI was due to the inhibition of oxidative stress, inflammation-and apoptosis-related pathways."

Lactylation-related hub genes (LRHGs) were identified by intersecting LRGs with differentially expressed genes and WGCNA results. Lactylation was assessed in a β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced mouse model and human aortic tissues. Two single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from the GEO database were utilized to evaluate lactylation patterns across cell populations and intercellular communication networks. Biomarkers were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.\n\nRESULTS: Elevated lactylation levels were observed in both TAD tissues and synthetic phenotype vascular smooth muscle cells. Through integrated analysis, we identified 12 LRHGs, which includes LDHA. In the BAPN-induced mouse model, LDHA inhibitors (Oxamate and FX11) significantly reduced mortality rates and decreased aortic lactate levels and protein lactylation. ScRNA-seq analytic results revealed that monocytes and macrophages exhibited the highest lactylation activity, which likely enhanced their inflammatory pathways and intercellular communication. ROC analysis showed the lowest AUC of 12 LRHGs is 0.8893.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the critical role of lactylation-related hub genes in TAD, identifying potential therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers, which provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TAD."

The neural and behavioral mechanisms for such primate-typical food preferences remain poorly understood, despite their importance for human health and their targeting by pharmacological obesity treatments. Here, we review a series of experiments that investigated how the biologically critical properties of foods-their nutrients (sugar, fat, protein) and oral-sensory qualities (viscosity, oral sliding friction)-influence food preferences in monkeys and humans. In an economic nutrient-choice paradigm, macaques flexibly trade nutrients and oral-sensory food qualities against varying food amounts, consistent with the assignment of subjective values. Nutrient-value functions that link objective nutrient content to subjective values accurately model these preferences, predict choices across contexts, and explain individual differences. The monkeys' aggregated choice patterns resulting from their nutrient preferences lead to daily nutrient balances that deviate from dietary reference points, resembling suboptimal human eating patterns when exposed to high-calorie foods. To investigate the sensory basis underlying nutrient values, we developed novel engineering tools that quantify food textures on oral surfaces, using fresh pig tongues. Oral-texture (i.e., mouthfeel) parameters, including viscosity and sliding friction, were shown to mediate monkeys' preferences for high-fat foods. When translated to human subjects, this approach revealed a neural mechanism for preferring high-fat foods from oral texture in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)-a key reward system of the brain. Importantly, human OFC responses to oral sliding friction in individual subjects-measured in the MRI scanner-predicted subsequent fat intake in a naturalistic, life-like eating test. These findings suggest that a primate nutrient-reward paradigm offers a promising approach for investigating the behavioral and neural mechanisms for human-typical food reward and food choice, to advance understanding of human eating behavior, overeating, and obesity."

The diagnostic process for HVL is frequently hindered by the disease's nonspecific clinical presentation and the inherent limitations of existing serological assays, which often exhibit suboptimal sensitivity and specificity, predisposing to diagnostic inaccuracies. Developing of sensitive and specific diagnostic assays is crucial for effective HVL control in Brazil, enabling early disease detection and improving treatment outcomes. To enhance diagnostic capabilities, we evaluated the performance of a chimeric protein designed from B-lymphocyte cell epitopes identified through immunoproteomic analysis in serological tests for detecting L. infantum infection. Under the experimental conditions, the chimeric protein demonstrated the following diagnostic performance: 100 % specificity against control samples, 94.12 % specificity against Chagas disease samples, and 100 % sensitivity for HVL-positive individuals. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the following performance metrics: area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9960, 100 % sensitivity, and 97.10 % overall specificity, significantly exceeding the performance of the L. infantum soluble antigen (SLiA) ELISA. These findings suggest that the chimeric protein represents a promising antigen for developing of improved HVL diagnostic technologies, potentially reducing the disease's public health impact."

Decades of work with animal models prepared the ground for interpreting the results of human genome analyses associating polymorphisms with memory deficits, mood disorders, and dysregulation of food intake. These association studies include a frequent human polymorphism causing an amino acid substitution in the protein-coding sequence of BDNF. Even if its biochemical impact is still incompletely understood, this polymorphism helped understanding of the role of BDNF in humans in specific aspects of memory and neurodegeneration and in central nervous system (CNS) remyelination after lesion.

    "text": "This comprehensive review examines the emerging role of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) as complementary approaches to conventional Tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The review focuses on diverse HDT mechanisms utilizing their modulators like small molecule, protein-based, lipid-based, vitamin-based, and polysaccharide-based therapeutics. Key mechanisms include autophagy induction through multiple pathways, including mTOR inhibition, calcium signaling modulation, and TFEB activation. Notable compounds such as dimethyl itaconate, tamoxifen, and berbamine demonstrate significant efficacy in enhancing autophagosome formation and bacterial clearance. Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors like doxycycline show promise in reducing tissue damage and cavity formation. The review highlights the importance of metabolic modulation through compounds like metformin and ezetimibe, which target cellular energy pathways and cholesterol metabolism respectively. Immunomodulatory approaches, including phosphodiesterase inhibition and cytokine regulation, demonstrate potential in optimizing host immune responses. Novel mechanisms such as ferroptosis inhibition and pyroptosis modulation present promising therapeutic avenues. The review also examines the role of established drugs being repurposed for TB treatment, including statins and antidepressants. While preclinical evidence supports the efficacy of various HDTs, the review emphasizes the need for careful consideration of host-pathogen interactions and potential immunological approaches. The complexity of TB pathophysiology necessitates a personalized approach to HDT implementation. Future research directions should focus on clinical validation, optimal dosing strategies, and combination approaches with standard antimicrobial therapy. This review underscores the potential of HDTs to address drug resistance and persistent infections, while highlighting the importance of continued investigation into their safety and efficacy across diverse patient populations."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: The accumulation of excess lipids within skeletal muscle, which can progress to overt myosteatosis, is more common among persons with HIV (PWH) and contributes to the development of frailty, impaired mobility, and metabolic dysregulation. Excess free fatty acids (FFA) can impair muscle mitochondrial function, which is reflected in higher plasma levels of several acylcarnitines. We assessed the relationship between CT-determined skeletal muscle density and plasma acylcarnitines among male PWH on long-term antiretroviral therapy.\n\nDESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of two prospectively recruited clinical cohorts with harmonized study procedures and imaging.\n\nMETHODS: Linear regression models assessed the relationship of fasting plasma acylcarnitines measured by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and skeletal muscle density measured by CT, adjusted for study cohort, age, body mass index (BMI), CD4 + cell count, visceral adipose tissue area, total plasma triglycerides, and insulin resistance.\n\nRESULTS: Among 160 male PWH (median age 54 years, median BMI 30.5 kg/m 2 , and 41% Black), higher plasma levels of short-chain acetylcarnitine (C2 : 0) and isobutyrylcarnitine (C4 : 0), the medium chain hexanoylcarnitine (C6 : 1), and the long chain myristoylcarnitine (C14 : 0) and palmitoylcarnitine (C16 : 0) were associated with skeletal muscle density, while others approached significance. None of the C3 and C5 acylcarnitines, largely the products of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, were associated with skeletal muscle density.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: CT measurements of skeletal muscle density in male PWH appear to identify impaired mitochondrial FFA oxidation as measured by plasma FFA metabolites, which could serve as a biomarker for future intervention studies to mitigate skeletal muscle deterioration and metabolic dysregulation."

We found that the co-modification of S and Pd on CNMF could enhance the responsive feature the as-prepared nanocomposite to acidic environment, which endowed the Pd-S-CNMF with multiple enzyme mimicking activities and enhanced NIR light absorption. To construct efficient nanoplatform for prostate cancer therapy, a HSP 90 protein inhibitor, tanespimycin was loaded on Pd-S-CNMF (17Pd-S-CNMF) to inhibit the level of HSP 90 protein, thus increasing the outcome of subsequent photothermal therapy. The constructed 17Pd-S-CNMF is expected to remodel tumor microenvironment (TME), generate sufficient highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hyperthermia to enhance the efficacy of chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). In addition, comparing to the pristine CNMF and S doped CNMF, the as-prepared Pd-S-CNMF possessed superior magnetic TME sensitive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performance. Benefiting from these amazing properties, the as-prepared 17Pd-S-CNMF could effectively inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in vitro and vivo. Our findings provide a paradigm for construction of efficient nanocomposites as nanoplatform for cancer diagnose and treatment."

Therefore, we performed a systematic review with pairwise and network meta-analyses to determine the efficacy of different modes of exercise training for improving inflammation in patients with T2D. A systematic literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to May 2024 using four main key words including \"exercise,\" \"cytokines,\" \"type 2 diabetes,\" and \"randomization.\" Randomized control or clinical trials investigating the effects of any exercise training mode, including aerobic training (AT), resistance training (RT), AT + RT, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and HIIT + RT on inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, or adiponectin in patients with T2D were included. Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects models. Overall, 60 studies involving 3339 patients with T2D were included. Compared to control, exercise training effectively reduced IL-6 [SMD: -0.58], TNF-α [SMD: -0.62], CRP [SMD: -0.78], and leptin [SMD: -0.27], and increased adiponectin [SMD: 0.35]. Based on network meta-analysis, AT reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and leptin and increased adiponectin; and AT + RT reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and CRP, and increased adiponectin. However, RT, HIIT, and HIIT + RT did not change any inflammatory markers as compared with controls. Exercise training is an effective approach for lowering chronic low-grade inflammation in patients with T2D; specifically, AT and AT + RT appear to be more effective than RT, HIIT, or HIIT + RT."

A PH mouse model was established using SU5416 combined with hypoxia (Su/Hy) in both wild-type and TOP2A knockout mice. Echocardiography, hemodynamic measurements, and histological analyses were performed to assess pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular function. Human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) were exposed to hypoxia to mimic PH in vitro. TOP2A and YTHDF1 were knocked down or overexpressed in PASMCs using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell proliferation, migration, inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy were evaluated using various biological assays. RIP and MeRIP assays were conducted to investigate the interaction between YTHDF1 and TOP2A mRNA. Data showed that TOP2A expression was significantly elevated in the lung tissues of Su/Hy-induced PH mice and hypoxia-exposed PASMCs. Functionally, TOP2A depletion in mice attenuated pulmonary vascular remodeling, improved right ventricular function, reduced macrophage activation, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress markers. Similarly, in hypoxia-treated PASMCs, TOP2A silencing inhibited cell proliferation, migration, inflammatory cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and autophagy-related protein expression. Furthermore, elevated m6A levels and increased YTHDF1 expression were observed in PH models, and we found that YTHDF1 bound to m6A-modified TOP2A mRNA to enhance its translation. Additionally, YTHDF1 knockdown reduced TOP2A protein expression and mitigated hypoxia-induced PASMCs dysfunction, while TOP2A overexpression reversed these protective effects. Mechanistically, TOP2A activated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, driving PASMCs proliferation and migration. Collectively, this study identifies YTHDF1-mediated m6A modification as a key regulator of TOP2A expression, which promotes PASMCs dysfunction and vascular remodeling in PH via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway."

Therefore, improving treatment methods is essential for the management of this cancer. Turmerones, which are the main volatile natural components of Curcuma longa Linn, have shown a number of beneficial biological activities both in vitro and in vivo. However, because of their hydrophobicity, their delivery methods need substantial improvement. Niosomes, which are made of non-ionic surfactants, have shown promising results in drug delivery systems (DDSs). Due to their appropriate encapsulation rate, stability, bioavailability, and predictable release patterns, they could be useful tools in DDSs. In this study, we demonstrated the benefit of treatment with turmerone-loaded niosomes on cancerous phenotypes of two HCC cell line in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMETHOD: Turmerone-loaded niosomes were synthesized through thin-film hydration method and characterized with dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The impact of turmerone-loaded niosomes on Huh-7 and Hep3B cells were assessed in vitro in term of gene expression, protein production, apoptosis, cell cycle, and some functional assessments such as colony formation potential and migration. Furthermore, tumorigenesis potential of the turmerone-loaded niosomes treated hepatoma cells was assessed in an in vivo model using nude mice.\n\nRESULTS: Our in vitro experiments showed that turmerone-loaded niosomes induced apoptosis (26.04 % for Huh-7 and 29.7 % for Hep3B) and cell cycle arrest in Huh-7 and Hep3B cells. Additionally, turmerone-loaded niosomes treatment down-regulated EMT-inducing genes and significantly decreased the EMT phenotype, as well as decreased colony formation capacity in both cell lines (surviving fraction of 0.27 for Huh-7 and 0.032 for Hep3B). In vivo study showed that upon transplantation, hepatoma cells which have been pre-treated with turmerone-loaded niosomes have less growth rate and produced smaller tumors with significantly few proliferating cells in nude mice.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study showed that turmerone delivery through niosome have higher anti-cancer potentials in comparison to free-turmerone treatment on HCC cell line. Therefore, this approach could have a promising therapeutic potential in combination with other approved clinical settings for HCC treatment."

Herein, a girl's markedly discordant HPP featured at presentation life-threatening hypercalcemia, failure-to-thrive, and renal compromise. Subsequent pseudotumor cerebri syndrome caused blindness, and then craniosynostosis required cranial vault reconstruction. However, she was not deformed, had moderate hypophosphatasemia, normal plasma PLP level, and mild radiographic features of HPP rickets. Elevated plasma N-terminal parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) suggested malignancy, but corrected after kidney transplantation. HPP was diagnosed when whole exome sequencing revealed heterozygous ALPL c.1034C>T, p.A345V found in mild pediatric HPP and transmitted by her mother who considered herself well. Genes conditioning ePPi formation and underlying other skeletal diseases were intact.

A clear distinction can be observed in terms of MHM metabolites of mothers with different delivery modes and parities with a 95% confidence interval. A total of 119 differentially expressed metabolites (DEMs) were identified in MHM of women with different delivery modes. Metabolic pathway analyses indicated that these DEMs were mainly associated with fatty acid biosynthesis. The higher abundances of these DEMs in MHM of cesarean women may be due to the differing levels of cortisol and oxytocin between mothers with different delivery modes. Meanwhile, 284 DEMs were identified in MHM of women with different parities. These DEMs were primarily related to ABC transporters, center carbon metabolism in cancer, and D-amino acid metabolism. These findings highlighted the impact of delivery mode and parity on HM metabolite composition.

This study aimed to investigate the role of RD5 in the development of hepatic steatosis in individuals with obesity and explore the detailed mechanisms involved. Protein expression was evaluated via Western blot analysis, whereas hepatic lipid deposition was examined via Oil Red O staining and triglyceride quantification. Autophagosomes were detected via MDC staining. Our findings indicated that RD5 treatment normalized lipogenic lipid accumulation, fatty acid uptake, oxidation, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in palmitate-treated primary hepatocytes. As a cytoprotective signaling pathway, RD5 treatment increased the expression of SIRT6 and autophagy markers, such as those involved in LC3 conversion and p62 degradation. The beneficial effects of RD5 on hepatic lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and ER stress were negated by SIRT6 small interfering RNA or 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy. Furthermore, RD5 administration decreased hepatic steatosis, apoptosis, and ER stress in the livers of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. In line with the in vitro results, RD5 treatment elevated SIRT6 and autophagy levels in the livers of HFD-fed mice. These novel findings suggest that RD5 improves hepatic lipid metabolism, apoptosis and ER stress through SIRT6/autophagy signaling, thereby attenuating hepatic steatosis.

The MTS-hydrogel platform was subjected to PEFs varying in pulse width and electric field (EF) strength.

In vitro experimentation was validated with a multi-layered spheroid finite element model, evaluating transmembrane potential (TMP), pore density, and pore formation across the spheroid layers. MTS exposed to longer pulse widths (5, 100 μs) and higher EFs (2000, 2500 V/cm) experienced a complete ablation. Smaller pulse widths and lower EFs produced partial ablations initially reducing the MTS, but unable to prevent the MTS from recuperating. Similarly shown with the computational model, a TMP was accomplished through the MTS, inducing electroporation; however, pore formation was dictated by the increase in pulse width and EF beyond the superficial layer. EFs of 2000 V/cm and above severely constrained the migration independent of pulse width."

    "text": "Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) prediction plays a crucial role in the drug discovery process by evaluating the strength of the interaction between a drug and its biological target, which is often a protein. Despite advancements in DTA prediction through deep learning, several fundamental challenges persist: (i) suboptimal information propagation in molecular graphs, limiting the effective representation of complex drug structures, (ii) accurately modeling the complex interactions between drug-binding sites and protein substructures, and (iii) prioritizing critical substructure interactions to enhance both accuracy and interpretability. To address these challenges, the DICCA-DTA framework is introduced, aiming to improve the contextual integration of molecular information and facilitate a more comprehensive representation of drug-target interactions in allopathic research. It employs a Diffused Isomorphic Network (DIN) to extract comprehensive drug features from molecular graphs, capturing both local substructures and global information. Furthermore, a Contextualized Capsule Attention Network (CCAN) module incorporates multi-head attention with capsule networks to capture both local and global protein sequence characteristics. The attention-guided Factorized Cross-Pooling (FCP) mechanism dynamically refines drug-protein interaction modeling by selectively emphasizing critical binding site interactions, thereby enhancing predictive accuracy. Explainable attention maps further reveal the most crucial drug-protein binding site interactions, providing transparent insights into the model's decision-making process. Comprehensive evaluations across the Davis, KIBA, Metz and BindingDB datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the DICCA-DTA framework over existing state-of-the-art models. A case study on cancer-related protein interactions from the DrugBank database further demonstrates the framework's precision in identifying key drug-protein affinities, reinforcing its potential to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing."

    "text": "Pathway enrichment analysis is a valuable tool for researchers aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying any specific drug or disease associated gene lists derived from biological assays or large-scale genome (omics) experiments. By employing this method, researchers can pinpoint biological pathways that exhibit a higher level of enrichment for a given set of genes than would be anticipated by random chance. These biological pathways play a crucial role in understanding the disease pathophysiology, therapeutic strategy, polypharmacological effects, synergistic mechanisms, and target engagement. However many of the available tools do not fulfill this requirement as most of the available tools consider a flat hierarchy of protein involvement in the pathway and do not consider topological information or importance of molecules in the pathway. Here we propose a novel method to enrich the molecular pathways and prioritize them based on their importance and crucial role in the biological function using the graph and evidence-based approach and customized datasets called PathwayMind. It includes 2648 pathways, 4539 biological events, 2465847 protein-protein interactions and 124717 gene-to-pathway relationships and the role of 3510 unique initial genes in 11,992 molecular pathways. The current manuscript comprises three major steps: The first step is about the data extraction and datasets creation for pathway enrichment, and the second steps comprises pathway perturbation analysis to identify most perturbed biological pathways and the third steps includes validation of this approach along with standalone tools and visualization algorithms which disclose the molecular involvement and improve the interpretability of the results. The end-to-end pathway analysis can be performed in a few minutes to provide complete insights of your target or drug of interest. The current PathwayMind tool and its datasets could be very useful for the molecular scientists and system biologists who are interested to understand the therapeutic effects of their drugs or understanding the involvement of biological pathways for specific gene sets which does not require any prior bioinformatics training."

    "text": "Accurately predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) is crucial for drug discovery and can reduce drug development costs. Recent deep learning-based DTI predictions have demonstrated promising performance, but they still face two challenges: (i) The over-reliance on the extraction of local features and insufficient learning of global features limit the model's performance. (ii) The lack of effective fusion of drug-target interaction features leads to the lack of interpretability of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for predicting drug-target interactions based on multi-order gated convolution and multi-attention fusion, MGMA-DTI. The drug feature encoder obtains a two-dimensional molecular graph based on the drug's SMILES string and uses a graph convolutional neural network to encode the drug features. The protein encoder is based on a multi-order gated convolution, which enhances the model's ability to capture global feature between amino acid sequences. In order to better achieve interactive learning between drugs and proteins, we designed a multi-attention fusion module that effectively captures the drug-target interaction features. Experimental results show that MGMA-DTI outperforms other baseline models on three benchmark datasets: BindingDB, BioSNAP, and Human. Case studies further demonstrate that the model provides valuable insights for drug discovery. In addition, our model provides molecular-level interpretability, which can provide more scientifically meaningful guidance."

    "text": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disorder with a complex pathogenesis that requires combination therapies rather than monotherapies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exhibit inherently efficient delivery to the liver and can be engineered to carry various therapeutic substances, making them promising agents. In this study, EVs were engineered to display fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) on their surface and encapsulate miR-223 (223/F-EVs), aiming to improve steatosis and alleviate inflammation and fibrosis, respectively. Introducing the 223/F-EVs into human liver cell lines significantly reduced both basal and induced levels of lipid storage, inflammation, and fibrosis markers. Furthermore, using an FGF21-blocking antibody or miR-223 inhibitor effectively diminished the efficacy of the 223/F-EVs, confirming the essential roles of FGF21 and miR-223 in these processes. In a Choline-Deficient, l-Amino acid-defined, High-Fat Diet (CDAHFD)-fed mouse model, intravenously administered 223/F-EVs demonstrated liver-preferential delivery and a marked reduction in the MASH phenotype without compromising bone density, unlike conventional FGF21 treatment. Collectively, 223/F-EVs convey FGF21 and miR-223 exclusively to the liver, offering strategic advantages by mitigating MASH progression via multiple pathways. This study lays a solid foundation for further investigation of engineered EVs as a transformative therapeutic approach for treating MASH."

SjMEP-40 was fragmented into three distinct portions-SjMEP-40 N (N-terminal), SjMEP-40 M (middle), and SjMEP-40C (C-terminal)-to determine which segment provides the best diagnostic performance compared to the whole antigen (SjMEP-40 W) for both IgG and IgM detection. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to analyze archived samples from various endemic areas in the Philippines, all previously confirmed either positive or negative for Schistosoma japonicum infection through microscopy or stool PCR. Additionally, cross-reactivity tests were conducted with other parasitic infections, including paragonimiasis, clonorchiasis, and opisthorchiasis. IgG ELISA results revealed that SjMEP-40 M has the sensitivity (82.24 %) and specificity (95.97 %). On the other hand, SjMEP-40 N showed the highest sensitivity (85.5 %) and positivity rates in IgM ELISA with both microscopy and PCR-positive samples. Overall, SjMEP-40 M showed the best diagnostic results for IgG evaluation, whereas SjMEP-40 N is the fragment responsible for antigen detection at the early stage of the disease, as shown by the IgM ELISA results.

Type II collagen was administered to DBA/1J mice to induce CIA. Vehicle or remdesivir was injected subcutaneously three times a week. During 7 weeks of treatment, the arthritis score and incidence were evaluated twice a week. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging were used to evaluate CD4 + T cells in the spleen. FLSs from patients with RA were stimulated in vitro with remdesivir and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and western blotting was used to measure the expression of STING and necroptosis-related markers.\n\nRESULTS: Remdesivir administration suppressed the incidence and progression of arthritis in mice with CIA. Histological analysis revealed lower inflammation and cartilage damage scores in remdesivir-treated than in vehicle groups. Interleukin (IL)-17 + CD4 + T-cell differentiation was inhibited in the remdesivir-treated group. Furthermore, IL-17/-6/-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein -1, and TNF-α expression was reduced in the remdesivir group. In vitro, remdesivir suppressed the expression of STING, nuclear factor-κB, RIPK3, and phosphorylated MLKL in RA-FLSs under TNF-α stimulation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The antiviral agent remdesivir suppressed arthritis by regulating Th cell differentiation, pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, the STING pathway, and necroptosis."

This work investigated treatment effects between women and men in the PARAGLIDE-HF (Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF) trial.\n\nMETHODS: In this prespecified subgroup analysis, we examined outcomes according to sex in the PARAGLIDE-HF trial. The primary endpoint was time-average proportional change in amino terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) from baseline through Weeks 4 and 8. We also examined secondary outcomes and tolerability.\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 242 women (52%) and 224 men (48%) were randomized. Women had significantly higher LVEF, worse renal function, and less comorbidities than men. In the overall population, the time-averaged reduction in NT-proBNP was significantly greater for sacubitril/valsartan (sac/val) than valsartan (ratio of change 0.85, 95% CI, 0.73-0.999). When examined according to sex, the time-averaged reduction in NT-proBNP was numerically greater with sac/val in both women (ratio of change = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.69-1.070) and men (ratio of change 0.84, 95% CI, 0.67-1.05) with no differential treatment effect (P interaction = .91). Similarly, the secondary hierarchical endpoint favored sac/val over valsartan in both women and men but was not statistically significant. Study drug dosage levels were similar across women and men and there were no sex-specific differences in the incidence of adverse events.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In patients with mildly reduced or preserved EF >40% and a recent worsening HF event, the efficacy, safety and tolerability of sac/val vs valsartan were similar in both women and men, suggesting consistent effects across appropriately selected patients regardless of sex. Future prospective studies are needed to further evaluate sex-specific differences in treatment response of HFpEF therapies.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Prospective comparison of ARNI with ARB Given following stabiLization In DEcompensated HFpEF; NCT03988634; https://www.\n\nCLINICALTRIALS: gov/study/NCT03988634."

A common form of CKD is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most inherited genetic kidney disease and affects greater than 12.5 million individuals globally. Given that there are over 400 pathogenic PKD1/PKD2 mutations in patients with ADPKD, relying solely on small molecule drugs targeting a single signaling pathway has not been effective in treating ADPKD. Urinary extracellular vesicles (uEVs) are naturally released by cells from the kidneys and the urinary tract, and uEVs isolated from non-disease sources have been reported to carry functional polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), the respective products of PKD1 and PKD2 genes that are mutated in ADPKD. uEVs from non-disease sources, as a result, have the potential to provide a direct solution to the root of the disease by delivering functional proteins that are mutated in ADPKD. To test our hypothesis, we first isolated uEVs from healthy mice urine and conducted a comprehensive characterization of uEVs. Then, PC1 levels and EV markers CD63 and TSG101 of uEVs were confirmed via ELISA and Western blot. Following characterization of uEVs, the in vitro cellular uptake, inhibition of cyst growth, and gene rescue ability of uEVs were demonstrated in kidney cells. Next, upon administration of uEVs in vivo, uEVs showed bioavailability and accumulation in the kidneys. Lastly, uEV treatment in ADPKD mice (Pkd1"

Results showed that SDF at a low ratio (≤ 3.5) induced a compact matrix structure, which decreased protein digestibility to 67.70 % and total amino acids release to 140.67 mg/g protein, respectively. The compaction of the noodle matrix could be attributed to the promotion of cross-linking between D-type low molecular weight gluten and γ-gliadin by a small amount of SDF, reducing lacunarity from 0.28 to 0.16. A high SDF ratio (>3.5) induced a more fragmented matrix structure, increasing protein digestibility to 76.88 %. Notably, at a higher SDF ratio (>4.5), the concentration-dependent static quenching on enzymatic sites of SDF became prominent, slightly reducing gastric protein digestibility.

At the salivary level, MPs formed a dense network with artificial saliva (AS) through key hydrophobic interactions. Fluorescence spectroscopy results indicated that the primary interaction force between CECA and AS were electrostatic interaction. However, as the concentration of CECA increased, the stacking of polysaccharide chains enhanced the exposure of protein components, thereby promoting additional hydrophobic interactions with AS. In contrast, the rigid triple-helical structure of 2082 facilitated greater exposure of its protein components, leading to predominant hydrophobic interactions with AS. Texture analysis demonstrated that MPs formed an adhesive layer on the tongue surface. Molecular docking analysis revealed that MPs inhibited the activation of the bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 by MOPC through two mechanisms: reducing binding sites and blocking receptor activation. These findings provided practical applications for improving the taste of wine and offered a theoretical foundation for modulating undesirable tastes in other beverage systems."

    "text": "OBJECTIVES: Cardiac troponins (cTn) are used to detect and quantify acute cardiomyocyte injury. In patients presenting with symptoms that could indicate myocarditis, elevated cTn concentrations typically mandate cardiac catheterization and heart muscle biopsy or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Accordingly, increased cTn levels due to macrotroponin - a complex between patient anti-troponin autoantibodies and cTn - could lead to unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions. In athletes, ensuring cardiac health after infection like COVID-19 is critical, but the occurrence of false-positive cTn levels post-COVID-19 remains unknown.\n\nMETHODS: This observational study prospectively included 35 healthy athletes (aged 16-75 years; 19 females, 16 males) who underwent post-COVID check-ups during 2022-2023. Athletes' cTn levels were measured using four different hs-cTn routine immunoassays. If discrepancies were noted between assays, further testing for macrotroponin was conducted using protein G column, sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation and anti-troponin autoantibody immunoassay.\n\nRESULTS: Seventeen athletes had normal cTn levels across all assays, while 18 (51 %) had elevated cTn, mostly cTnI. Despite elevated cTn levels, no signs of myocarditis or other cardiac conditions were found on electrocardiography, echocardiography, or CMR. Macrotroponin was confirmed among 16 of these 18 athletes. Further, IgG anti-troponin autoantibodies correlated significantly with the levels of the two most-commonly affected assays: hs-cTnI-Siemens Atellica and hs-cTnI-Abbott Alinity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Post-COVID-19, nearly half of athletes showed elevated cTnI levels due to interference from macrotroponin. Awareness among physicians and laboratorians of this analytical confounder can avoid unnecessary invasive or costly diagnostic tests in athletes with false-positive cTnI levels after COVID-19."

Participants with CTE-NC were identified and matched approximately 1:4 to those without CTE-NC on demographics (age, education, sex) and staging of Alzheimer and Lewy body neuropathology. Chi-square tests and analyses of covariance (covarying for cognitive symptom duration, time to death, and cognitive diagnosis) compared neuropathologic features, history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuropsychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism features, and neuropsychological scores between groups.\n\nRESULTS: CTE-NC was present in 0.8% of participants (29/3,845) since 2014. Matching on a 1:4 ratio was achieved for 22 individuals and 1:3 for an additional 3, yielding a total comparison sample of 25 with CTE-NC and 97 without. All but 1 individual with CTE-NC were male with a mean age of 74.7 years (SD = 8.0). Moderate-to-severe Alzheimer neuropathology (54.0%) was common in those with CTE-NC while comorbid cortical or limbic Lewy inclusions were less frequent (8.0%). Compared with those without CTE-NC, those with CTE-NC had higher rates of hippocampal sclerosis (40.0% vs 9.6%;\n\nDISCUSSION: CTE-NC was rare in NACC since 2014. Those with CTE-NC did not differ in clinical symptoms but had higher rates of hippocampal sclerosis, other tauopathies, and TDP-43 inclusions. In this clinicopathologic investigation using in vivo clinical data, although NACC lacks CTE-NC severity/distribution and repetitive head impact data for sensitivity analyses. Larger in vivo clinicopathologic studies are greatly needed to correlate CTE-NC with clinical features."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease closely linked to intestinal mucosal microcirculatory dysfunction. Sweroside (SOS), a natural iridoid glycoside derived from plants such as Swertia mussotii, Swertia pseudochinensis, and Lonicera japonica, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties. Yet, its therapeutic potential and mechanisms in UC remain unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the effects of SOS on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC and its underlying mechanisms.\n\nMETHODS: A DSS-induced UC mouse model was established to evaluate the efficacy of SOS. Inflammatory cytokine levels, intestinal barrier function (assessed via MUC2 immunofluorescence, FITC-dextran permeability, and tight junction protein analysis), and mucosal microcirculation (measured by Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging) were examined. Angiogenesis and endothelial cell (EC) damage were analyzed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. Transcriptomics and molecular docking were utilized to investigate SOS-mediated pathways, with subsequent validation by qRT-PCR, western blot, and immunofluorescence. Additionally, a cellular injury model was generated by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with DSS. Cellular inflammatory and angiogenesis-related factors were quantified via ELISA, while migration and angiogenesis capabilities of HUVECs were assessed through scratch and tube-forming assays. The expression of the VEGF and Hippo pathway-related proteins was determined by western blot.\n\nRESULTS: SOS significantly ameliorated UC symptoms, reducing weight loss, diarrhea, and DAI scores while suppressing inflammatory infiltration and cytokine release. SOS enhanced intestinal barrier integrity via tight junction upregulation and improved microcirculation by attenuating EC injury and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, SOS regulated the VEGF and Hippo pathways, a key regulator of angiogenesis, as confirmed by transcriptomics and molecular docking. In vitro, SOS protected HUVECs from DSS-induced inflammation and angiogenesis, confirming the improvement of mucosal microcirculation by modulating VEGF and Hippo pathways.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: SOS ameliorates DSS-induced UC by impacting the VEGF and Hippo pathways, thereby suppressing ECs' angiogenesis, restoring mucosal microcirculation, and mitigating intestinal inflammation. These findings highlight SOS as a promising therapeutic candidate for UC."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Whole blood sample consists of red and white blood cells, platelets, nucleic acids, proteins, and other metabolites. However, the presence of blood cells will affect the monitoring of biomarker in plasma. To obtain plasma from microscale whole blood, plasma separation membranes are commonly used. However, obtaining high-purity plasma within a short time in point-of-care cases still remains a significant challenge. It is evident that achieving high yield/purity and high recovery rate of markers plasma separation from microliters of whole blood in an extremely short time is crucial for the point-of-care (POC) testing.\n\nRESULTS: Here, we propose dual-gradient (structural\\wetting gradient) plasma separation membranes (DG-PSMs) to effectively address the above issue. Specifically, the upper layer of DG-PSM pre-treated by blood-typing antibody exhibits hydrophobicity, which can promote red blood cell (RBC) agglutination reaction. In addition, the wetting gradient can generate wetting gradient force, which also facilitates the rapid transport of plasma. As a result, the DG-PSM can extract extremely pure plasma (∼99.99 %) from ∼15 μL whole blood. More importantly, the plasma separation costs only 15 s, far less than that of other traditional plasma separation membranes (e.g., 5-10 min). The flash separation process reduces the possibility of entanglement/absorption of protein by paper fibers, achieving an ultra-high protein recovery rate (∼98.88 %). In addition, the DG-PSM is comparable to centrifugation in avoiding hemolysis of RBCs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE: More importantly, the plasma separated by DG-PSM was tested for blood glucose detection by integrating microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) and colorimetric assays, which achieved rapid blood glucose detection (∼20 s). The DG-PSM promotes the realization of plasma separation and detection on lab-on-a-chip. We believe DG-PSM can be integrated into more detection devices to benefit mankind in remote areas and developing countries."

This longitudinal study enrolled 89 CKD patients. A total of 71 pesticides, including 9 carbamate pesticides, were detected in the urine samples. Our findings indicated that higher concentrations of carbamates, possibly from the diet, may significant be associated with oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial energy metabolism in CKD patients. Integrating machine learning approach identified l-glutamine (L-Glu), 3-chlorotyrosine, and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine as potential biomarkers of pesticide exposure, with an area under the curve of >0.903 based on machine learning- a receiver operating characteristic analysis. Both CKD and pesticide exposure were associated with abnormalities in amino acid and energy metabolism. Key metabolites such as L-cysteine, Acetyl-CoA, L-Glu, and L-histidine were identified as endogenous markers capable of predicting changes in both renal dysfunction and pesticide exposure among CKD patients. Detecting exposure-related metabolic alterations through metabolomics enables early identification and aids in the understanding and potential prevention of kidney disease progression. This study further can explore the clinical applicability and improve predictive value of these biomarkers."

However, current delivery methods are either invasive or inefficient due to low bioavailability. Therefore, an alternative route of administration is needed. Pulmonary delivery is a promising option as it can provide high bioavailability and a rapid onset of action. Beyond systemic analgesia, NAL has also shown local therapeutic benefits in the lungs. This study aimed to develop inhalable NAL powders using spray drying, with leucine and human serum albumin (HSA) as dispersion enhancers. The resulting powders were amorphous and contained <4 % residual solvent by mass. The spray dried particles were spherical, 3-4 µm large, and exhibited corrugated surface. Spray dried NAL alone were inhalable, with a fine particle fraction <5 µm (FPF) at 25 %. The addition of HSA improved the FPF to 33 % and 37 % for 10 % and 20 % w/w HSA, respectively. Similarly, the FPF increased to 39 % after adding 10 % w/w leucine, reaching a maximum of 47 % with 20 % w/w leucine. The latter formulation also demonstrated good chemical and physical stability after one month of storage at 25 °C under both 30 % and 60 % relative humidity. These formulations can be used as a platform to deliver NAL and other opioid analgesics by inhalation."

Epidermal growth factor-like repeats and discoidin I-like domains 3 (EDIL3) is a matrix protein associated with the onset and progression of various diseases, yet its role in PH remains unexamined. This research aims to assess the expression of EDIL3 in PH and to investigate its underlying mechanisms in the condition. Our results indicated that EDIL3 levels are elevated in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (iPAH), as well as in hypoxia-treated pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) compared to normoxia-treated controls. Additionally, a mouse model of PH induced by SU5416 along with hypoxia (Su/Hx) also expressed elevated EDIL3 levels. We discovered that EDIL3 knockdown diminished the proliferation and migration of PASMCs. Mechanically, we identified an interaction between EDIL3 and integrin αVβ3. The regulation of PASMCs proliferation by EDIL3 was disrupted by cilengitide, an RGD pentapeptide that serves as a potent and selective inhibitor of integrin αVβ3. Furthermore, recombinant EDIL3 significantly increased the level of p-ERK1/2, an effect that was blocked by cilengitide, while p-p38 and p-JNK levels remained unchanged. In summary, our study introduces a novel therapeutic strategy for treating PAH and highlights a new serum biomarker for its diagnosis."

Cell-based assays for antigen-specific antibodies and IgG binding to the surface of live hippocampal neurons were performed on 13 CSFs and 65 sera, many sampled longitudinally, from 34 Vietnamese children with JE. Three month outcomes were scored according to a pediatric post-encephalitis scale; clinical features focussed on new onset symptoms during the follow-up, blinded to antibody results. Ten/34 children (29 %) had serum antibodies against known neuronal-surface antigens, 4 NMDAR, 4 CASPR2, 1 GABAAR and 1 LGI1, detected from day 23 after onset. In addition, 8/10 (80 %) of these children and 13/24 (54 %) others had antibodies that bound in a distinctive pattern to live hippocampal neurons (HN-Abs), four detected on days 9-12. A relapse was only considered possible in 5 patients, two with specific neuronal surface antibodies (NSAbs). Neither specific NSAbs (p = 1.00) nor HN-Abs (p = 1.00).were more common in patients with possible relapse than in those with unlikely relapse. There was a modest trend towards worse outcome scores in patients with known NSAbs than in the remaining patients (p = 0.089). Antibodies to neuronal surface proteins, known and unknown, are common in children after JE. Caution is urged in defining post-infectious autoimmune encephalitis on the basis of a positive neuronal antibody and new onset symptoms or deterioration following recovery from JE, or in initiating immunotherapy without confirmatory evidence of a time-dependent encephalitic illness defined by published guidelines."

    "text": "The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is well-known for its exceptionally high taurine content, but the mechanisms underlying taurine biosynthesis remain largely unexplored. Thecysteamine (AET) pathway is one of the primary metabolic routes involved in taurine biosynthesis, and its role in mollusk taurine synthesis has garnered increasing recognition. In the present study, a cysteamine dioxygenase (ADO) homolog CgADO, the central enzyme of the AET pathway, was identified in C. gigas, which contained a typical PCO_ADO domain. The transcripts of CgADO were constitutively expressed in examined oyster tissues, with the highest level detected in the adductor muscle while the lowest in the hepatopancreas. The recombinant CgADO protein, expressed in Escherichia coli, was capable of converting cysteamine to hypotaurine. Overexpression of CgADO in HEK293T cells increased the production of taurine by 20.31-fold, compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. Inhibition of endogenous CgADO expression using RNA interference resulted in a 49% reduction in its mRNA expression and an 8% decline in taurine content in the adductor muscle of oysters. These results indicated that CgADO functioned as a cysteamine dioxygenase and played a certain role in taurine biosynthesis in C. gigas."

However, the therapeutic efficacy of CBD is limited by extensive hepatic metabolism and low oral bioavailability (approximately 20 %). These problems can be overcome by choosing an appropriate targeted drug delivery system. Delivering CBD to the lungs via a dry powder formulation could be an effective method to achieve adequate concentration and therapeutic efficacy. This study aims to develop a dry powder formulation of CBD with Inulin (INU) and L-leucine (LEC) using spray drying and to characterize its physicochemical and aerodynamic properties. A design of experiments (DOE) approach was used to optimize the formulation by varying feed concentration (0.2 % w/v to 0.8 % w/v), LEC concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w), and CBD concentration (5 % w/w to 20 % w/w). The resulting CBD dry powder formulations exhibited a wrinkled morphology with particle sizes ranging from 1 to 5 µm and displayed a crystalline structure, as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. The response surface method (RSM) showed that increasing the feed concentration correlated with higher yields of the CBD formulations. Specifically, the formulation with a feed concentration of 0.8 % w/v achieved a yield of 61 %. The aerosolization data demonstrated a direct relationship between the Fine Particle Fraction (FPF) and LEC concentration, indicating that FPF increases as the LEC concentration increases. The highest FPF of 62 % was achieved with a 20 % w/w LEC concentration and a feed concentration of 0.2 % w/v. Based on this, LEC plays a crucial role in enhancing aerosolization efficiency. While feed concentration negatively affects FPF, lower feed concentrations lead to an increase in FPF. The Fine Particle Dose (FPD) varied with the concentration of CBD, with higher concentrations resulting in a higher FPD. A 28 days stability study under different humidity conditions (<15 % and 53 %) confirmed the stability of the CBD formulations. INU and LEC exhibited minimal cytotoxicity on A549 cells, while the raw CBD and CBD formulations showed comparable levels of cytotoxicity, pIC"

This property renders them particularly suitable for the delivery of biologics - large, structurally complex, and often unstable therapeutic agents such as proteins, peptides, nucleic acids, vaccines, and live cells or microorganisms. MNs offer a painless, self-administrable, and user-friendly alternative to conventional parenteral routes that often require trained personnel, generate hazardous waste, and result in low patient compliance. Since their first description in the 1990s, a wide variety of MN systems have been developed including solid, hollow, coated, dissolving, and hydrogel-forming, each with distinct fabrication and formulation requirements. This review provides a detailed and comparative discussion on formulation strategies tailored for the efficient delivery of different classes of biologics using MNs, with emphasis on the physicochemical and biological interactions at the skin interface. Special attention is given to sterilization, an often-overlooked yet regulatory-critical aspect, highlighting its importance for product safety, bioburden control, and biologic stability. Both terminal sterilization methods and aseptic manufacturing approaches are reviewed along with emerging alternatives such as self-sterilizing MNs. The review also provides a comprehensive overview of biologic-loaded MNs currently undergoing clinical evaluation. While previous reviews have focused on materials or fabrication aspects, this article presents a formulation-centric analysis, integrating physicochemical considerations, delivery challenges, and clinical translation pathways. The goal is to provide formulation scientists and translational researchers with a practical guide to MN-enabled biologic delivery systems, from bench to bedside."

HS tissues were collected from patients and compared with normal skin samples. CYT997 decreased HSF viability in a concentration-dependent manner, with a selected concentration for further experiments. It selectively induced apoptosis in HSFs but not in normal fibroblasts, as shown by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. CYT997 also reduced HSF migration, contractility, and expression of collagen I and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), indicating decreased fibrosis. In a rabbit ear hypertrophic scar model, CYT997 treatment inhibited scar formation, reduced the scar elevation index, and promoted apoptosis in HSFs. It also regulated apoptosis-related proteins poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and caspase-3 in HSFs. These findings suggest that CYT997 has potential as a targeted therapy for hypertrophic scars by inducing apoptosis in HSFs and reducing fibrotic activity."

PA and depressive symptoms were assessed using self-report scales. The WCS was calculated by subtracting self-reported average weekday sleep hours from weekend sleep hours, and serum hsCRP levels were measured using immunoturbidimetric methods. Given that depressive symptoms are characterized by their multifaceted nature, we identified specific symptoms associated with hsCRP levels. Path analysis was used to investigate the association between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and depressive symptoms, and that between PA, WCS, hsCRP, and specific symptoms related to hsCRP.\n\nRESULTS: Higher levels of PA and WCS were associated with a decreased risk of depressive symptoms through lowering hsCRP levels. Among various depressive symptoms, sleep problems and appetite changes were associated with hsCRP. In pathway analyses using them as dependent variables, higher levels of PA and WCS were also associated with a decreased risk of sleep problems and appetite changes through lowering hsCRP levels.\n\nLIMITATIONS: The current study employed a cross-sectional design, and WCS and PA were based on participants' self-reports rather than objective measurements.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Increased levels of PA and WCS may help alleviate depressive symptoms, particularly sleep problems and appetite changes, by mitigating chronic inflammation. Therefore, ensuring adequate exercise time and compensating for inadequate weekday sleep during weekends are crucial for maintaining mental well-being."

    "text": "The increasing global demand for protein, coupled with concerns over the environmental sustainability of animal-derived sources, has prompted the search for alternative protein sources. Microalgae have emerged as a promising solution due to their high productivity, protein content, and ability to grow in non-arable environments or photobioreactors. Their proteins, hydrolysates and peptides exhibit diverse bioactivities, including anti-obesity, anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-hypertensive effects, as well as functional properties such as emulsification, foaming and gelling. However, their practical utilization is hindered by challenges such as high production costs and environmental sensitivity, particularly in relation to pH, temperature, and light, which can affect their structural stability and functional performance. This review summarizes traditional and innovative extraction techniques, discusses the structure-function relationships of these microalgal components, and highlights their potential applications. Furthermore, it identifies key production and commercialization challenges, proposing strategies to enhance extraction efficiency and environmental stability during processing and storage, thereby facilitating broader industrial implementation."

The results showed that the particle size, ζ-potential, polymer dispersity index, encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of LCA-CS-P were 228 ± 3.56 nm, -32.5 ± 0.62 mV, 0.23 ± 0.02, 88.6 ± 1.12 %, and 22.5 ± 0.92 % respectively. Gastrointestinal digestion dynamically modulates the hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic interactions within nanoparticles. This pH-responsive interaction reconfiguration governs their gastric stability, intestinal release, and increased bioavailability (2.47-fold AUC increase vs. free LCA). In addition, LCA-CS-P not only significantly increased the content of LCA in various tissues, but also had gastric targeting. Therefore, LCA-CS-P nanoparticles are a viable strategy to improve the oral bioavailability of LCA and other active ingredients."

The assays employ a sandwich-format design in which nanobodies replace traditional antibodies, providing high stability and low background interference. Clinical evaluation demonstrated that NMP22 detection achieved 81.8 % sensitivity and 90.9 % specificity, while survivin detection yielded 72.7 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Both assays showed no significant differences compared to commercial ELISA kits (p > 0.05). Notably, multiplex detection using both strips achieved 100.0 % sensitivity and 90.9 % specificity, demonstrating superior performance compared to single-biomarker approaches.

Despite its benefits, PEGylated proteins are often heterogeneous mixtures containing positional isoforms that are challenging to eliminate and can significantly impact the biological activity of drugs. This study developed a reversed-phase ultra-performance liquid chromatography (RP-UPLC) method for the separation and quantification of positional isoforms in commercial PEGylated recombinant human growth hormone (PEG-rhGH) at the peptide level. In this strategy, PEG-rhGH was digested into peptides via trypsin treatment and then separated and quantified using RP-UPLC. Under the chromatography condition optimized from Quality by Design (QbD) principles, this method can effectively distinguish the PEGylated peptides in five isomers. MALDI-TOF MS, SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation indicated that each of these five isomers was conjugated with one 40 kDa branched PEG at a specific lysine residue and the N-terminal. Through the concentration correction of PEGylated peptides varying in sequence lengths, the proportion of five modified sites can be quantified. The comparative assay showed that this strategy effectively addresses the limitations of the commonly used IEC method, especially under challenging conditions like post-translational modifications (e.g., oxidation, deamidation, and cyclization) and conformational changes. As a result, it offers improved robustness and accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed RP-UPLC method exhibited outstanding repeatability across various storage conditions, making it a reliable tool for quality control and product release in the biopharmaceutical industry."

This study aimed to the cardioprotective effect of sT-cad.\n\nMETHODS & RESULTS: The sT-cad-expressing plasmid was administered to 7-week-old wild-type mice. One week after administration, transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery was performed to induce pressure-overload heart failure. Then, the mice were sacrificed at 2 weeks after the surgery. In the mice that received sT-cad, the TAC-induced increase in heart weight and decline in cardiac function were significantly attenuated. Based on the cardiac histological analysis, sT-cad suppressed both cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. Cardiac RNA sequencing analysis showed that sT-cad inhibited the TAC-induced upregulation of fibrosis-related genes. In addition, in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts, sT-cad supplementation suppressed the TGF-β-induced mRNA expression of Acta2, a myofibroblast marker.\n\nCONCLUSION: sT-cad ameliorated the pressure overload-induced heart failure in mice."

One of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies for IPF, oral pirfenidone (PFD), has limited clinical applications owing to its systemic side effects. In contrast to oral administration, inhaled therapy offers enhanced therapeutic efficacy at the target organ while minimizing systemic side effects. However, its application has challenges, such as limited drug delivery to the distal lung region and rapid clearance. In this study, we developed pulmonary surfactant (PS)-based PFD-loaded nanovesicles (PFD-PSNVs) for targeted delivery to the lung area and prolonged retention and examined their safety, stability, and antifibrotic efficacy. PFD-PSNVs were prepared using the thin-film hydration and extrusion method. The mean size and zeta potential of PFD-PSNVs were 149.7 ± 10.1 nm and - 31.3 ± 2.3 mV, respectively. An in vitro antifibrotic study showed that PFD-PSNVs inhibited the expression of fibrotic factors such as p-ERK, p-SMAD2/3, and α-SMA proteins on fibroblasts activated by transforming growth factor-β1. When inhaled in mice using a nebulizer, the PFD-PSNVs remained in lung tissues for 24 h, whereas Arikayce, an FDA-approved liposomal formulation for inhalation, was eliminated within 6 h. In a bleomycin sulfate-induced IPF mouse model, inhalation treatment with PFD-PSNVs significantly reduced collagen deposition (76.2 ± 4.1 %, p < 0.01) and α-SMA expression (60.8 ± 3.7 %, p < 0.05) compared with inhalation treatment with the PFD-loaded CtrlNV (PFD-CNVs) formulation and oral administration of PFD. These results indicate that PSNVs have great potential as an inhaled drug delivery system for the treatment of IPF."

Early detection and targeted therapy depend on identifying key molecular biomarkers that drive tumor progression. The molecular heterogeneity of COAD demands robust computational strategies to improve the accuracy of biomarker discovery.\n\nMETHODS: We developed and implemented a comprehensive, multi-step bioinformatics and statistical pipeline to systematically prioritize clinically relevant biomarkers in COAD. This pipeline integrated differential gene expression analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and functional enrichment analysis to identify key hub genes associated with tumor progression. We subsequently applied principal component analysis (PCA) and overall survival modeling to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these candidates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess their sensitivity and specificity. Finally, experimental validation of the prioritized hub genes was conducted via qPCR across three CRC cell lines (LoVo, HCT-116, and HT-29), confirming their upregulation and supporting their clinical potential.\n\nRESULTS: Our integrative pipeline prioritized five key hub genes (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) as significantly upregulated in COAD tissues compared to normal controls. Functional enrichment analysis linked these genes to extracellular matrix degradation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammatory signaling, and tumor invasion, underscoring their roles in key oncogenic processes. Survival analysis revealed varying degrees of association with patient prognosis, most notably for CXCL1. Diagnostic performance, assessed by ROC analysis, yielded moderate AUC values (0.669-0.692), supporting their potential as biomarkers. Finally, qPCR validation across three CRC cell lines confirmed robust upregulation of all five genes, reinforcing their biological relevance in COAD progression.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our study establishes a reproducible, integrative bioinformatics and statistical framework for the systematic identification of clinically actionable biomarkers in CRC. The five hub genes prioritized (CDH3, CXCL1, MMP1, MMP3, and TGFBI) demonstrated consistent diagnostic and prognostic value, offering a solid basis for the development of non-invasive molecular diagnostics and contributing to precision oncology."

The nutrient adequacy ratio and mean adequacy ratio were applied to estimate the adequacy of micronutrients. Standing height was measured using a wall-mounted stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm, and weight of the women was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a battery-powered digital scale (Seca Gmbh & Co. KG, Germany). A linear regression model was fitted to determine the relationship between nutritional status and khat chewing. Binary logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the odds of nutrient intake inadequacy among the two study groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant at 95% CI.\n\nRESULTS: Women who chewed khat had a higher prevalence of underweight (36.6%) than those who did not (9.4%). The mean (SD) body mass index for khat chewer women was 48.66±5.39 kg, while that of non-chewer women was 55.29±6.75 kg.

The BioGL module learned the optimal graph representations of gene interactions by utilizing the constructed protein-protein interaction network, which represents initial gene relationships, and gene frequency information obtained from gene enrichment analysis. Finally, the graph convolutional network was used to identify drug hepatotoxicity. Our method pays more attention to gene-gene relationships compared to previous approaches, thereby achieving more accurate predictive performance. We applied BioGL-GCN to predict DILI risk for active components in the integrated traditional Chinese medicine (ITCM) database and validated these predictions through hepatotoxicity experiments using a 3D primary human hepatocyte (PHH) model.

All the effusions included were exudative and lymphocytic. In Training and Testing groups respectively, 49 and 104 cases were tuberculous, 143 and 92 were malignant, and 81 and 164 were diagnosed with \"other diseases\"; pre-test probabilities of pleural tuberculosis were 4% and 12.7%. Variables included were: age, pH, adenosine deaminase, glucose, protein, and lactate dehydrogenase levels, and white cell counts (total and differential) in pleural fluid. We used two ML classifiers: binary (tuberculous and non-tuberculous), and three-class (tuberculous, malignant, and others); and compared them with Bayesian analysis.\n\nRESULTS: The best binary classifier yielded a sensitivity of 88%, specificity of 98%, and accuracy of 95%. The best three-class classifier achieved the same accuracy and correctly classified 83% (77/92) of malignant cases. The ML models yielded higher positive predictive values than Bayesian analysis based on ADA > 40 U/l and lymphocyte percentage ≥ 50% (92%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This external validation confirms the good performance of the previously reported ML approach for predicting the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis based on exudative and lymphocytic pleural effusions, and for discriminating the cases most likely to be malignant. Additionally, ML was more accurate than the Bayesian approach in our study."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: The Government of Indonesia and UNICEF introduced the Aksi Bergizi Social Behavioral Change Communication (SBCC) intervention to promote healthy dietary behaviors among adolescents. However, no systematic assessment of the Program's effect has been made. The objectives of this study are: 1) to assess the extent to which exposure to the Aksi Bergizi Program is associated with dietary behaviors among secondary school students, and; 2) to assess mediation of the mentioned association by dietary self-efficacy.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a school-based cross-sectional study in Padang Municipality, Indonesia. We collected data from 253 students attending Aksi Bergizi target schools, and 253 students from non-target schools, using self-administered questionnaire with a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) section. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics with analysis of mediation by self-efficacy in dietary consumption.\n\nRESULTS: We identified three distinct dietary patterns among the students: one characterized by higher frequencies of eating meat, processed foods, and dessert (i.e., \"High Protein and Processed Foods\" dietary pattern), another by higher frequencies of eating snacks and sweetened drinks (\"Snacks and Sugary Drinks\"), and another by higher frequencies of eating soybean products and fresh fruits and lower frequency of eating preserved vegetables (\"Healthier Diet\"). Students in the Aksi Bergizi target schools were significantly less likely than students in the non-target schools to have the High Protein and Processed Foods dietary pattern (40.2% vs. 53.9%, Adjusted OR = 0.44; 95% CI = 0.20, 0.99) and more likely to have a Healthier Diet pattern, although the difference of the latter was not statistically significant. Students in the target schools, however, were also more likely than students in the non-target schools to have the Snacks and Sugary Drinks dietary pattern (78.7% vs. 40.4%, Adjusted OR = 6.22; 95% CI = 2.68, 14.42). Regarding mediation, students in the Aksi Bergizi target schools had significantly different dietary self-efficacy from students in the non-target schools (p < 0.001). However, self-efficacy was not significantly associated with dietary habits. The association in the non-mediated pathway between exposure to the Aksi Bergizi program and dietary habits was statistically significant (p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The findings of this study have implications for stakeholders in adolescent health. However, limitations regarding the cross-sectional design (which precludes the ability to make causal inference), social desirability, and limited generalizability should be considered in the interpretation of the study findings."

To address this, an integrated urinary metabolomics and peptidomics analysis was conducted comparing HN patients to hypertensive (HTN) controls, aiming to identify molecular signatures indicative of disease progression and clarify the pathophysiological mechanisms driving HN development. Urine samples were analyzed from both discovery (51 HTN vs 51 HN patients, including 27 early stage and 24 advanced-stage) and validation (21 HTN vs 21 HN) cohorts. Multivariate statistical analysis identified 40 differential metabolites across various stages: hypertension, early stage HN, and advanced-stage HN. These metabolites were associated with metabolic pathways including amino acid, carbohydrate, short-chain fatty acid, and nucleotide metabolism, such as cysteine and methionine, tyrosine, and nicotinate metabolism. Moreover, 10 differential urinary peptides were linked to coagulation regulation, immune processes, and plasminogen activation. Combining 43 clinical-correlated molecules, a high-performance diagnostic model was developed, demonstrating remarkable discrimination: AUCs of 0.973 (HTN vs early-HN), 0.998 (HTN vs advanced-HN), and 0.941 (early vs advanced-HN) in the discovery cohort, which were maintained at 0.847-0.970 in validation. Advanced-HN detection achieved exceptional accuracy (90.5%), specificity (95.2%), precision (94.7%), and an F1-score of 0.900.

We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the causal relationships between insulin use and PND. The forward MR analysis revealed that insulin use considerably reduced the risk of delirium (odds ratio [OR] = 0.01, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.0007-0.22, P = 0.003) and enhanced cognitive performance (OR = 8.03, 95 % CI: 2.83-22.78, P = 0.001). Importantly, the reverse MR analysis indicated that cognitive impairment or delirium did not causally affect insulin use (OR ≈ 1.0, P > 0.5). Utilizing GEO datasets, we identified 63 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) common to both postoperative delirium and insulin treatment. Subsequent analyses, including the construction of a protein-protein interaction network and Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway analyses, identified EPN2, DNAJC6, ARFGAP1, and HIP1R as key hub genes that could serve as potential therapeutic targets for PND. Further research showed that these hub genes are part of a multi-pathway interactive network, which may significantly contribute to the onset and progression of PND, with insulin also affecting their regulation. Our results establish a unidirectional genetic causality for the therapeutic effects of insulin in PND and reveal new molecular targets, thereby improving our understanding of the mechanisms behind insulin treatment for PND."

Moreover, an in vivo atherosclerosis model was established by tail vein injection of AAV8-PCSK9 virus into mice who were then fed a high-fat diet. EGR3 expression was manipulated through cellular lentiviral transfection and conditional gene knockout in mice. Oil red O staining was used to assess lipid droplet and mouse aortic plaque formation. HE staining was used to observe pathological changes in mouse aortic tissue. To quantify C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, ELISA was conducted on HCAEC lysates and mouse serum samples. Western blot analysis was conducted to determine EGR3 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) protein levels and in both cellular lysates and mouse aortic tissue.\n\nRESULTS: In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that EGR3 expression was elevated in the ox-LDL group. Furthermore, in vitro studies revealed that the CRP and VCAM-1 expression levels were significantly reduced and that lipid droplet formation was inhibited by EGR3 inhibition. Consistently, CRP, VCAM-1, blood glucose and lipid levels, and the severity of atherosclerotic lesions in mice were significantly reduced in Egr3 knockout mice.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that atherosclerosis development appears to be associated with the regulation of CRP and VCAM expression by EGR3. These results suggest that targeting EGR3 may be a promising approach for treating atherosclerosis."

This makes biotin an attractive ligand for tumor-targeted drug delivery. Building on this rationale, this study presents a series of six D-(+)-biotin-conjugated squaraine dyes derived from benzothiazole, indolenine, and benz[e]indole, with N-ethyl and N-hexyl chains. These compounds were thoroughly characterized in terms of their photophysical and photochemical properties, revealing strong absorption in the so-called \"phototherapeutic window\", notable fluorescence, especially the benzothiazole derivatives, aqueous stability, particularly the indolenine-based dyes, and moderate to high photostability. Computational studies further indicated a strong binding affinity to human serum albumin and avidin proteins. All dyes exhibited photodynamic activity, with indolenine derivatives showing remarkable tumor selectivity and benz[e]indole analogs evidencing superior photocytotoxicity. The most promising compounds preferentially accumulated in mitochondria, and both singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen species were found to play a role in their photobiological effects. Additionally, they were non-genotoxic in the absence of irradiation, and apoptosis was the primary mechanism of cell death upon light activation. This was evidenced by preserved cytoplasmic membrane integrity, nuclear fragmentation, and caspase-3/7 activation, reinforcing the safety and potential of these compounds as phototherapeutic agents. Although cellular uptake via the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter was not established, and diffusion is expected to be the predominant mechanism, the high predicted avidin-binding affinity of these dyes opens exciting new avenues for photodynamic therapy-combined strategies."

The SV dose ranged from 50 mg twice daily to 200 mg twice daily. Blood pressure measurements were compared at baseline and during follow-up intervals to assess therapeutic efficacy. Safety evaluations included comprehensive monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events throughout the observation period.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 64 MHD patients hypertension (mean age = 54.11 years; male proportion = 73.4%) were ultimately included in the study. After three months of treatment with SV, the mean reductions in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse pressure were 21.06 ± 15.82 mmHg (P < 0.001), 8.41 ± 13.09 mmHg (P < 0.001), and 12.65 ± 13.17 mmHg (P < 0.001), respectively. With respect to safety, new-onset intradialytic hypotension was observed in three patients. The study also included twelve patients with hyperkalemia. Importantly, no patients reported experiencing cough, angioedema, or abnormal liver biochemistry. Among the 64 subjects, none required a dose reduction or discontinuation of SV due to these adverse effects.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In MHD patients with hypertension, SV demonstrates a preliminary ability to lower blood pressure and appears safe. Further prospective randomized studies are warranted to validate our findings."

Because of their ability to interrogate large numbers of variants, multiplexed assays of variant effect and computational tools are viewed as a critical part of the solution to variant classification uncertainty. However, the (joint) performance of these assays and tools on novel variants has not been established. Transformation of the qualitative classification guidelines developed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) into a quantitative Bayesian point system enables empirical validation of strength of evidence assigned to evidence criteria. Here, we derived a maximum-likelihood estimate model that converts frequentist odds ratios calculated from case-control data to proportions pathogenic and applied this model to functional assays, alone and in combination with computational tools across several domains of BRCA1. Furthermore, we defined exceptionally conserved ancestral residues (ECARs) and interrogated the performance of assays and tools at these residues in BRCA1. We found that missense substitutions in BRCA1 that fall at ECARs are disproportionately likely to be pathogenic with effect sizes similar to that of protein-truncating variants. In contrast, for substitutions falling at non-ECAR positions, concordant predictions of pathogenicity from functional assays and computational tools often fail to meet the additive assumptions of strength in ACMG guidelines. Thus, collectively, we conclude that strengths of evidence assigned by expert opinion in the ACMG guidelines are not universally applicable and require empirical validation."

Methods: data was collected from the 2007-2018 Continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Weighted binary logistic regression was adopted to investigate the association between sedentary behavior and CKD risk. Weighted binary logistic regression and restricted cubic spline were performed to evaluate the correlation between dietary plant protein and CKD risk in sedentary individuals. Results: participants with higher sedentary behavior (≥ 6 h/day) had a 1.13 times higher risk of developing CKD than those with lower sedentary behavior (< 6 h/day). In participants with higher sedentary behavior, intake of a higher plant protein ratio was associated with reduced CKD risk. In a continuous model, after adjusting for all covariates, each 10 % increase in plant protein ratio decreased CKD risk by 35.4 % (odds ratio (OR), 0.646; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.465-0.899). Compared with the lowest quartile, the OR for the highest quartiles was 0.740 in a categorical model (95 % CI, 0.614-0.893).

This study aimed to describe HEN practices and outcomes within a private healthcare service in Argentina. Methods: a retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted, including all adult and pediatric patients receiving HEN in April 2023. Data on demographic, clinical, nutritional, and HEN characteristics were collected. Nutritional regimens, access methods, infusion modalities, and complications were analysed. Statistical analysis included descriptive and comparative tests, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Results: among 1,816 patients (1,269 adults, 547 children), neurological conditions were the leading indication for HEN (adults: 77.9 %, paediatric: 67.8 %), followed by oncological conditions (adults: 11.7 %, paediatric: 1.3 %). Gastrostomy was the predominant access method, and non-continuous infusion was most common (cyclic in adults, intermittent in paediatric). Complication rates related to nutrition access were low (adults: 2.3 %, paediatric: 2.9 %), with tube dislodgement and ostomy leakage as the most frequent issues. Nutritional formulas were prescribed based on caloric and protein needs, with no significant differences in complication rates between formula types. Conclusion: this first Latin American study on HEN highlights the predominance of neurological conditions, the preference for gastrostomy access, and non-continuous feeding. The low complication rates suggest the safety of HEN, underscoring the need for standardized data collection and regulation to optimize care and outcomes in Argentina."

Recent advancements in gene sequencing technologies have led to the identification of numerous genes associated with heart failure. By utilizing available gene expression data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we conducted a screening for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to heart failure. Key genes were identified through intersection analysis in conjunction with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Following this, we pinpointed four essential genes (ITIH5, ISLR, ASPN, and FNDC1) by employing functional enrichment analyses, machine learning approaches, protein-protein interaction (PPI) assessments, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration evaluations. Additionally, a novel diagnostic model for heart failure was successfully developed using a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN), and its diagnostic performance was validated within public datasets. Analysis via single-cell RNA sequencing further indicated stable up-regulation patterns of these genes across various cardiomyocyte types in HF patients. Moreover, the exploration of drug-protein interactions revealed two potential therapeutic drugs targeting the identified key genes, with molecular docking offering a feasible pathway for this connection. In conclusion, we identified four potential key biomarkers closely related to HF and two possibly effective small molecules, which provide significant insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying heart failure and the search for new therapeutic targets."

Comparators were C-reactive protein at a cut-off of 5mg/l and chest x-ray (CXR). A multivariable model incorporating clinical and ultrasound findings was explored using generalized mixed models and a random forest approach. (Trial registry DRKS00026636).\n\nFINDINGS: Among 541 participants, 102 (19%) were diagnosed with TB and 1% were HIV-positive. The \"Focused Assessment with Sonography for HIV-associated TB\" (FASH) demonstrated moderate sensitivity (51%) and specificity (70%). Consolidations <1 cm on LUS showed high sensitivity (93%) but low specificity (16%) and were also seen in non-TB lung infections and other conditions like bronchial asthma and COPD. Accuracy of larger (≥1 cm) consolidations (72% sensitive, 55% specific) on LUS was comparable with CXR suggesting possible TB (81% sensitive, 58% specific). Predictive modeling suggests moderate diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.79).\n\nINTERPRETATION: In our study, POCUS did not meet WHO targets for a stand-alone facility-based screening test. Nevertheless, diagnostic accuracy for some findings is comparable to CXR and could be integrated into diagnostic algorithms to improve TB screening where CXR cannot reach. Future research should explore artificial intelligence to enhance TB-POCUS accuracy and accessibility, as was previously reported for CXR.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXT: Prior to this study, lung ultrasound (LUS) for TB had been assessed in only a few studies, limited by uncertain sonographic characterization of TB-related findings, lack of consistent terminology, and small numbers of participants with confirmed non-TB diagnoses to determine specificity for TB. Studies evaluating Focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated tuberculosis (FASH) almost exclusively included HIV-infected individuals and demonstrated moderate sensitivity and specificity. However, varying study designs and reference standards limit broader generalization of their findings. Our prospective study from a TB-endemic setting (India) recruited 541 predominantly HIV-negative participants with presumed TB. This is the largest cohort to date assessing LUS, FASH, and additional ultrasound findings for TB diagnosis. Our study demonstrates that no single ultrasound finding alone, or even in combination, reaches the accuracy targets of the target product profile for a facility-based screening test (triage) proposed by WHO. FASH accuracy in our study aligned with previously reported data in HIV-negative participants but was less specific in HIV-positive participants. The accuracy of additional ultrasound items of LUS and FASH was comparable to chest x-ray (CXR). In summary, this study demonstrates accuracy of ultrasound for TB diagnosis, backed by a robust study design and using a comprehensive reference standard and CXR comparator for LUS. Modelling suggests that an algorithmic approach combining ultrasound and clinical findings may be of highest value to inform risk of TB and guide further testing to confirm the diagnosis of TB. Other use cases of POCUS, which may aid clinical decision making in the assessment of disease severity, sampling strategy, and monitoring, should be evaluated by future studies. These should also focus on the accuracy of POCUS in people living with HIV and children, as well as evaluate POCUS more broadly as part of a diagnostic algorithm and by using artificial intelligence to improve the yield of TB-POCUS."

Two datasets (GSE5010 and GSE50223) were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database, containing 38 and 84 blood CD4 + T cell samples, respectively. To eliminate batch effects, the surrogate variable analysis (sva) R package (version 3.38.0) was employed, enabling the integration of data for subsequent analysis. Immune cell infiltration profiles were assessed using the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) R package (version 1.36.3). A gene co-expression network was constructed via the Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) algorithm to identify disease-related modules. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the linear models for microarray data (limma) R package (version 3.34.7), followed by functional enrichment analysis using DAVID. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed based on the STRING database to highlight key genes. A diagnostic model was subsequently developed utilizing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression algorithm and Support Vector Machine (SVM) method, with its discriminative capacity assessed via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. A total of twenty-eight immune cell types were analyzed, revealing significant differences in eight types between the AR and control groups. Through WGCNA, three disease-related modules comprising 4278 candidate genes were identified. Differential expression analysis identified 326 significant DEGs, of which 257 overlapped with WGCNA-selected genes. These genes exhibited significant enrichment in immune-related pathways, including \"cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction\" and \"chemokine signaling pathway.\" Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) further uncovered 12 KEGG pathways significantly associated with disease risk scores. Drug screening identified 24 small molecule drugs related to key genes. A diagnostic model incorporating five genes (RFC4, LYN, IL3, TNFRSF1B, and RBBP7) was constructed, demonstrating diagnostic efficiencies of 0.843 and 0.739 in the training and validation sets, respectively. An AR mouse model was successfully established, and the expression levels of relevant genes were validated through RT-qPCR experiments. The five-gene diagnostic model established in this study exhibits strong predictive ability in distinguishing AR patients from healthy controls, with potential clinical applications in diagnosing AR and advancing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies."

However, most of the published clinical studies on Ayurveda interventions for osteoarthritis management have addressed selected modalities of Ayurveda treatment rather than the holistic therapeutic regimen.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a multimodal Ayurveda treatment protocol in the long-term management of primary osteoarthritis of the knee compared with standard care.\n\nMETHODS: The proposed open-label, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted in individuals of any gender aged 40 to 70 years and diagnosed with primary osteoarthritis of the knee as per the American College of Rheumatology criteria. Individuals with grade 4 radiographic changes in the affected knee (based on the Kellgren-Lawrence classification) and with comorbidities were not considered. The study was conducted at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India. A total of 150 participants underwent random assignment in a 1:1 ratio to receive either the Ayurveda treatment protocol or conventional standard care for 180 days. The primary outcome was the change in the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index score from baseline. The secondary outcome measures included the change in the score for pain, stiffness, and physical function from baseline; change in the range of motion of the knee joint; change in the score of the numeric pain rating scale, Pain Disability Index, and 12-item short-form survey questionnaire (to assess health-related quality of life); change in highly sensitive C-reactive protein levels, interleukin-6 levels, magnetic resonance imaging scan findings, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan findings; and change in the need for rescue analgesic medication from baseline. Safety was evaluated by recording the incidence of adverse events and changes in liver and kidney function tests from baseline.\n\nRESULTS: Recruitment of study participants commenced on October 11, 2022. Currently, all the participants completed the study and the analysis of the study outcomes is ongoing.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial will be the first study to explore the potential benefits of a multimodal Ayurveda regimen (based on Ayurveda principles and scientific evidence) in the long-term management of osteoarthritis of the knee through validated subjective, laboratory, and imaging parameters. The outcomes of this study may address the needs and challenges associated with osteoarthritis management.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trial Registry of India CTRI/2022/05/042792; https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/pmaindet2.php?EncHid=Njk0MTM=&Enc=&userName=.\n\nINTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT IDENTIFIER (IRRID): DERR1-10.2196/68306."

    "text": "The circadian rhythm is a key biological mechanism that aligns organisms' physiological processes with Earth's 24-h light-dark cycle, crucial for cellular and tissue homeostasis. Disruption of this system is linked to accelerated aging and age-related diseases. Central to circadian regulation is the CLOCK protein, which controls gene transcription related to tissue homeostasis, cellular senescence, and DNA repair. Research reveals CLOCK's dual role: in normal cells, it supports rejuvenation by activating DNA repair factors like XPA and modulating metabolism; in tumor cells, CLOCK signaling is often hijacked by oncogenic drivers like c-MYC and Pdia3, which inhibit telomere shortening / cellular senescence, thereby fostering uncontrolled proliferation and tumorigenesis. Additionally, gut microbiota-derived aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signals can disrupt the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex, affecting circadian rhythms. CLOCK also interacts with mTOR and NF-κB pathways to regulate autophagy and mitigate harmful secretions impacting tissue function. This review examines the molecular links between CLOCK and cellular senescence, drawing from animal and human studies, to highlight CLOCK's role in aging and its potential as a target for anti-aging therapies."

This study aims to systematically characterize the epidemiological profile of voriconazole-induced liver injury and identify modifiable independent risk factors. We analyzed 7,659 voriconazole-treated adults (2007-2020) from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University to determine incidence and injury subtypes. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors, with model performance evaluated by ROC (receiver-operating characteristic) analysis; sensitivity analyses addressed potential confounders.

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) several factors, such as inflammation and hypoxemia, stimulate or inhibit Hep production. Our aims were to assess the isoform concentrations in COPD, explore the associations between the isoforms and pathophysiological variables, and assess the effect of initiation of long-term oxygen treatment (LTOT) on Hep concentrations.\n\nMETHODS: The study population constituted 84 patients with COPD and 59 non-COPD participants. Hep isoforms, parameters of inflammation and iron status, and partial pressures of arterial oxygen (pO2) were measured at baseline and at 6-months follow-up in COPD patients. Associations between isoforms and clinical and biochemical characteristics were examined by multivariable tobit regression, while tobit regression with random effects was used to assess whether initiation of LTOT influenced the isoforms.\n\nRESULTS: At least one isoform was detected in 96% of the participants, of which Hep25 was the most and Hep22 the least common. All isoforms were associated with C-reactive protein and ferritin. Hep25 and Hep24 were also associated with transferrin saturation, and Hep24 was associated with urine albumin-creatinine ratio. None of the isoforms were associated with hemoglobin, pO2, smoking, or COPD. There was a significant reduction of Hep25 and Hep24 from baseline to follow-up.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: All isoforms were associated with inflammation, while Hep25 and Hep24 were associated with circulating iron and Hep24 with kidney disease. The concentrations of Hep isoforms were not associated with COPD, nor did initiation of LTOT result in significant changes of isoform concentrations."

Herein, we report the rational chemical design and synthesis of a dithiolane-incorporated lipidoid (S-DOPE) to construct an innovative LNP formulation, termed SLNP, for enhanced intracellular mRNA delivery. These chemically engineered SLNPs exploit an inherent thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, whereby the unique dithiolane moiety triggers a dynamic covalent disulfide-thiol exchange reaction with cell surface thiols. This chemically driven reaction facilitates direct cytosolic mRNA delivery, effectively bypassing endosomal entrapment, a major bottleneck for conventional LNPs. In vitro studies demonstrate that SLNP formulations achieve an 11-fold increase in mRNA transfection and translation efficiency compared to standard LNPs. Furthermore, in vivo evaluations reveal a 4.5-fold enhancement in mRNA expression and robust immune responses. SLNP-mediated vaccination at low doses elicits high titers of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased T-cell response. Notably, SLNPs induce neutralizing antibody titers against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that are comparable to those achieved with significantly higher doses of conventional LNPs, highlighting their substantial dose-sparing potential. These findings establish that SLNP, by leveraging the chemically innovative thiol-mediated uptake mechanism, offers a promising and chemically distinct strategy to enhance both the efficacy and safety of mRNA vaccines, which is particularly valuable in scenarios of limited vaccine supply and for minimizing potential adverse effects associated with high vaccine dosages."

    "text": "Sleep fragmentation is common in older adults and is associated with cognitive impairment and dementia, as well as key histopathological correlates of dementia, including small vessel disease and cerebral infarcts. Vascular and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are thought to contribute to cognitive decline and dementia. Pericytes, a key vascular cell type, may play a key role. In model organisms, sleep disruption is associated with pericyte dysfunction and blood-brain barrier breakdown. Recent advances in single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) technology have identified two transcriptionally distinct subtypes of pericytes: extracellular matrix protein-expressing M-pericytes and solute carrier-expressing T-pericytes. However, the relationship between sleep, pericyte biology and cognition in humans remains unclear. We tested the hypothesis that differences in the composition of brain pericyte subpopulations, as inferred from marker gene expression, may link sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline. We leveraged two published human brain snRNAseq datasets to identify specific marker genes for M- and T-type pericytes. We then used post-mortem bulk RNAseq data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n = 1092) and lateral orbitofrontal cortex (n = 495) to quantify expression of these marker genes in older adults in two longitudinal cohort studies: the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. We derived trajectories of global cognitive function from participants' ante-mortem annual cognitive assessments, while sleep fragmentation was derived from ante-mortem wrist-actigraphy recordings from a subset of 572 participants. We used multivariate linear regression to relate pericyte marker gene expression to sleep fragmentation and cognitive decline in the decade preceding death. In the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, greater average sleep fragmentation was associated with greater expression of M-pericyte marker genes [estimate = +3.65 × 10-1, standard error (SE) = 1.61 × 10-1, P = 0.024] but not T-pericyte marker genes. Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex expression of M-pericyte (estimate = -8.30 × 10-3, SE = 3.37 × 10-3, P = 0.014) but not T-pericyte marker genes was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in the 10 years prior to death. In the lateral orbitofrontal cortex, greater sleep fragmentation was also associated with greater composite M-pericyte gene expression (estimate = + 4.48 × 10-1, SE = 1.92 × 10-1, P = 0.02), which in turn was associated with faster cognitive decline in the decade preceding death (estimate = -1.30 × 10-2, SE = 4.55 × 10-3, P = 0.0044). These findings identify a potential role of M-pericytes in linking sleep fragmentation and cognitive trajectories in older adults. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of vascular mechanisms in linking disrupted sleep to dementia."

CMT2 clinical symptoms include distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, toe and foot deformities, with some patients presenting with reduced nerve conduction velocity. Mutations in the neurofilament light chain (NEFL) gene result in a specific form of CMT2 disease, CMT2E. NEFL encodes the protein, NF-L, one of the core intermediate filament proteins that contribute to the maintenance and stability of the axonal cytoskeleton. To better understand the underlying biology of CMT2E disease and advance the development of therapeutics, we generated a Nefl+/E397K mouse model. While the Nefl+/E397K mutation is inherited in a dominant manner, we also characterized NeflE397K/E397K mice to determine whether disease onset, progression or severity would be impacted. Consistent with CMT2E, lifespan was not altered in these novel mouse models. A longitudinal electrophysiology study demonstrated significant in vivo functional abnormalities as early as P21 in distal latency, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude and negative area. A significant reduction in the sciatic nerve axon area, diameter, and G-ratio was also present as early as P21. Through the twelve months measured, disease became more evident in all assessments. Collectively, these results demonstrate an early and robust in vivo electrophysiological phenotype and axonal pathology, making Nefl+/E397K and NeflE397K/E397K mice ideal for the evaluation of therapeutic approaches."

Recent preclinical evidence suggests that both modifications play a significant role in multiple disorders, including infections, chronic inflammatory diseases, and cancer, sparking great interest in their therapeutic potential. Structural characterization of ADARs (adenosine deaminases acting on RNA) and key m6A enzymes has enabled the development of small molecule inhibitors modulating their expression, enzymatic activity, or binding to target RNAs. Herein, we review preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic benefits of targeting ADARs and m6A enzymes in diverse disease contexts. Small molecule inhibitors of RNA modification enzymes have shown potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells, and have successfully inhibited tumor growth in vivo, without evident toxicity, while their combination with immuno-/chemotherapeutics displayed synergistic anti-neoplastic action. Adenosine RNA editing via recruitment of endogenous ADARs and usage of guide RNAs showed remarkable efficacy in correcting G-to-A point mutations and restoring the associated protein expression with limited off-target activity.

Recent findings demonstrated significant molecular similarities between PM-Mito and inclusion body myositis (IBM), suggesting a trajectory from early to late IBM and prompting the inclusion of PM-Mito as an IBM precursor (early IBM) within the IBM spectrum. Both PM-Mito and IBM show mitochondrial abnormalities, suggesting that mitochondrial disturbance is a crucial element of IBM pathogenesis. The primary objective of this cross-sectional study was to characterize the mitochondrial phenotype in PM-Mito at histological, ultrastructural and molecular levels and to study the interplay between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation. Skeletal muscle biopsies of 27 patients with PM-Mito and 27 with typical IBM were included for morphological and ultrastructural analysis. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and deletions were assessed by quantitative PCR and long-range PCR, respectively. In addition, full-length single-molecule sequencing of the mtDNA enabled precise mapping of deletions. Protein and RNA levels were studied using unbiased proteomic profiling, immunoblotting and bulk RNA sequencing. Cell-free mtDNA was measured in the serum of IBM patients. We found widespread mitochondrial abnormalities in both PM-Mito and IBM, illustrated by elevated numbers of cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-negative and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive fibres and prominent ultrastructural abnormalities, with disorganized and concentric cristae within enlarged and dysmorphic mitochondria. mtDNA copy numbers were significantly reduced, and multiple large-scale mtDNA deletions were already evident in PM-Mito compared with healthy age-matched controls, similar to the IBM group. The canonical cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of interferon genes inflammatory pathway was activated in PM-Mito and IBM, and we detected elevated levels of circulating cell-free mtDNA indicative of mtDNA leakage. In PM-Mito and IBM, these findings were accompanied by dysregulation of proteins and transcripts linked to the mitochondrial membranes. In summary, we identified that mitochondrial dysfunction with multiple mtDNA deletions and depletion, disturbed mitochondrial ultrastructure and defects of the inner mitochondrial membrane are features of PM-Mito and IBM, underlining the concept of an IBM-spectrum disease. Notably, mitochondrial abnormalities precede tissue remodelling and infiltration by specific T-cell subpopulations (e.g. KLRG1+) characteristic of late IBM. The activation of inflammatory, DNA-sensing pathways might be related to mtDNA release, which would indicate a significant role of mitochondria-associated inflammation in the pathogenesis of IBM-spectrum disease. This study highlights the crucial role of early mitochondrial abnormalities in the pathomechanism of IBM, which might lead to new approaches to therapy."

With combined muscle RNA sequencing and whole-genome sequencing, we uncovered a recurrent, de novo deep intronic variant in intron 11 of COL6A1 (c.930+189C>T) that leads to a dominantly acting in-frame pseudoexon insertion. We subsequently identified and have characterized an international cohort of 44 patients with this COL6A1 intron 11 causative variant, one of the most common recurrent causative variants in the collagen VI genes. Patients manifest a consistently severe phenotype characterized by a paucity of early symptoms followed by an accelerated progression to a severe form of UCMD, except for one patient with somatic mosaicism for this COL6A1 intron 11 variant who manifests a milder phenotype consistent with Bethlem muscular dystrophy. Partial amelioration of the disease phenotype in this individual provides a strong rationale for the development of our pseudoexon skipping therapy to successfully suppress the pseudoexon insertion, resulting in normal COL6A1 transcripts. We have previously shown that splice-modulating antisense oligomers applied in vitro effectively decreased the abundance of the mutant pseudoexon-containing COL6A1 transcripts to levels comparable to the in vivo scenario of the somatic mosaicism shown here, indicating that this therapeutic approach carries significant translational promise for ameliorating the severe form of UCMD caused by this common recurrent COL6A1 variant."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: Wound healing is a complex process involving haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodelling. Dysregulation in any phase impairs healing. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and amino acids are essential in promoting tissue repair. This study evaluated a topical medical device containing HA and amino acids for its safety and efficacy in treating hard-to-heal (chronic) wounds.\n\nMETHOD: This four-week, one-arm, two-centre pilot clinical study included patients with hard-to-heal wounds of various aetiologies. Wounds were classified by exudate level and amount of necrosis. Treatment with different vehicles (cream, gel or powder) was tailored based on wound characteristics. Wound size was measured at baseline and final visit, while symptom severity was tracked using the total symptom score (TSS). Investigator assessment and safety monitoring were also conducted.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included in the study. Wound size reduced significantly across all groups, with an average reduction of 54%, and 41% of patients achieving complete healing. Symptom severity, as measured by TSS, showed a consistent and significant reduction. Clinical improvement was observed in 95% of patients and no serious adverse events were reported. The product demonstrated good safety and tolerability.\n\nCONCLUSION: In this study, the HA and amino acids product effectively reduced ulcer size, improved symptoms and promoted healing, demonstrating its efficacy in hard-to-heal wound management. The findings are clinically significant but limited by the absence of a control group and a short observation period. Further randomised controlled trials are required to confirm these results and explore broader clinical applications."

The aligned compared to the random constructs demonstrated an increased ability to synthesize total soluble proteins, including collagen type V, but collagen type I levels were reduced. This finding reveals a differential pattern for these proteins. Additionally, the collagen fibril diameters were larger in the aligned tissue constructs compared to the random constructs. Fibronectin and CHP colocalization patterns did not differ between groups; however, fibronectin and decorin were increased in the aligned group in contrast to tenascin C, which showed no difference.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the alignment of the healing microenvironment plays a crucial role in modulating the structural properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulates the synthesis of key proteins that are closely involved in fibrillogenesis and are indicative of the quality of the deposited ECM.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: We developed a three-dimensional in vitro model that closely mimics in vivo conditions to investigate the role of corneal myofibroblasts in healing and regeneration. Ultimately, this model can help develop targeted antifibrotic therapies to prevent corneal scarring."

Disordered lipid metabolism inundates endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages with triglyceriderich lipoproteins, oxidized LDL and saturated fatty acids, expanding the intracellular palmitoylCoA pool and perturbing redox balance. Protein Spalmitoylation, the reversible attachment of palmitate to cysteine residues, converts excess palmitoylCoA into broad alterations in signalling and membrane dynamics. The FASN-ACSL-ZDHHC axis channel excess fatty acids into palmitoylCoA, which is transferred to pivotal proteins including the lipid transporter CD36, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), key ion channels and the pyroptosis effector gasdermin D (GSDMD). Cycles of palmitate addition and removal regulate membrane residency, foam cell formation, nitric oxide production, calcium handling and inflammatory cell death, thereby linking lipid burden to atherosclerotic plaque growth, arrhythmogenic risk, heart failure progression and pulmonary hypertension. Therapeutic targeting of fatty acid uptake, palmitoyltransferases or thioesterases alleviates metabolic overload, restores endothelial reactivity and preserves myocardial viability in experimental models. This review synthesizes mechanistic and preclinical studies to delineate how lipiddriven protein palmitoylation reprograms cardiovascular physiology and pathology."

Dysbiosis in the structure of the gut microbiota resulting in increased abundance of harmful bacteria and decreased beneficial bacteria has been frequently associated with CRC development. Recently, probiotics and their derivatives have received great attention as anticancer agents for prevention and treatment of various cancers. This study aimed to assess the potential effects of probiotic Bacillus coagulans Hammer and its derivatives on induction of apoptosis in human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro.\n\nMETHODS: Cell viability of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells was examined by MTT assay after exposure to varying concentrations of pasteurized and UV-killed B. coagulans Hammer, its extracellular vesicles (EVs), and cell-free supernatant (CFS). The apoptotic effects of different B. coagulans Hammer derivatives on HT-29 and Caco-2 cells were determined by analyzing the expression level of apoptosis-related genes (Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, Caspase-9) using RT-qPCR assay. Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry was performed to assess apoptosis. Protein expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was measured by Western blotting.\n\nRESULTS: High concentrations of B. coagulans Hammer derivatives significantly (P < 0.05) reduced viability of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells compared to untreated control. The results of RT-qPCR assay showed significant decrease in the expression level of antiapoptotic gene Bcl-2, and notable increase in the expression level of proapoptotic genes Bax, Bad, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9 in HT-29 and Caco-2 cells by B. coagulans Hammer derivatives. Flow cytometry demonstrated a high percentage of apoptotic HT-29 cells compared to untreated cells after exposure to B. coagulans Hammer derivatives. Western blotting analysis confirmed that treatment with EVs, UV-killed cells, and CFS significantly decreased Bcl-2 expression, and increased Bax expression in HT-29 cells.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that derivatives of probiotic B. coagulans Hammer can exert anticancer activity by induction of apoptosis in colon cancer HT-29 and Caco-2 cells. Further investigations are required to validate the safety and efficacy of B. coagulans Hammer derivatives in CRC prevention and treatment."

Nearly 20% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients develop liver metastases, and these patients are characterized by fewer and less active effector T cells. Preclinical work has shown that liver metastases cause systemic immunosuppression through siphoning neoantigen-specific CD8 + T cells from systemic circulation with subsequent macrophage-mediated intrahepatic death. In preclinical models, liver metastasis-directed radiotherapy can reverse this systemic immunosuppression and sensitize tumors to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. However, it is unknown whether liver metastasis-directed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (liver SABR) can sensitize tumors to anti-PD-(L)1 in human NSCLC.\n\nMETHODS: The HAMMER-NSCLC trial is a randomized phase II study planned to enroll 68 patients with newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC - without known targetable EGFR, ALK, BRAF, or ROS1 alterations - involving the liver. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to standard-of-care anti-PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy +/- platinum-based chemotherapy (Arm 1) or standard-of-care treatment plus liver SABR (Arm 2). Patients can be enrolled and randomized up to the start of cycle 3 of immunotherapy. For patients in Arm 2, it is preferred that liver SABR be completed prior to initiating standard-of-care anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Liver SABR must be completed prior to the third cycle of anti-PD-(L)1 or within 90 days of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy initiation, whichever is sooner. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include the safety/tolerability of liver SABR when added to anti-PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy, overall survival, and hepatic progression. The study needs 68 patients combined in the two arms to demonstrate an improvement in PFS with a hazard ratio of 0.6 to provide 80% power with a one-sided alpha of 10%.\n\nDISCUSSION: The HAMMER-NSCLC trial will determine if adding liver SABR to first-line anti-PD-(L)1-based immunotherapy +/- platinum-based chemotherapy can improve median PFS in patients with NSCLC liver metastases.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT05657873, registered 12/12/2022."

This study explored the photoprotective properties of Asparagus cochinchinensis extracts fermented with endophytic fungus Aspergillus aculeatus TD103. Compared to the unfermented control, TD103-fermented A. cochinchinensis demonstrated stronger radical scavenging and ferric ion reduction abilities in vivo, significantly reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increased the antioxidant enzymes including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. It also downregulated the expression of the AP-1 and MMP genes, reduced the content of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1) and increased type I procollagen amino-terminal propeptide (PINP) levels in UVB-induced HaCaT cells. Non-targeted metabolomics and HPLC quantification revealed that elevated sarsasapogenin content may critically contribute to enhanced photoprotective capacity in Asparagus cochinchinensis. The safety assessment of fungus TD103 revealed that this strain was not drug resistant and did not produce mycotoxins, thereby indicating its safety for application. Eye irritation tests demonstrated the safety profile of the fermented extract, indicating negligible irritant potential. The TD103-mediated fermentation markedly potentiated the photoprotective capacity of A. cochinchinensis, ​providing a viable biotechnological platform for sustainable cosmeceutical development targeting UV-induced skin damage."

Klotho is a multifunctional protein crucial in ageing, metabolism, and ion homeostasis. It has been confirmed that Klotho serves as a critical protective factor across multiple biological systems, with its roles in neuroprotection, cardiovascular health, and renal function being particularly noteworthy. This study aimed to investigate the protective role of Klotho protein against oxidative and nitrosative stress in heart IRI through regulation of the NOS/MMP pathway. The study utilised in vitro human cardiomyocyte culture and ex vivo isolated rat hearts subjected to IRI. Recombinant Klotho protein was administered to evaluate its effects on heart mechanical function, gene and protein expression of NOS isoforms, oxidative and nitrosative stress markers, MMP activity, and lipid metabolism. Administration of Klotho significantly improved heart mechanical and contractile function following ischemia/reperfusion. Klotho normalised the expression and synthesis of endothelial NOS and inducible NOS, resulting in reduced production of reactive nitrogen species and attenuated nitrosative stress. It also limited oxidative damage, reflected by decreased protein oxidation, and restored fatty acid metabolism. Additionally, Klotho regulated MMP-2 and MMP-9 synthesis and activity, thereby protecting heart contractile proteins from degradation. The Klotho protein exhibits significant cardioprotection in IRI by mitigating oxidative and nitrosative stress through the modulation of the NOS/MMP signalling pathway. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of Klotho in managing ischemic heart conditions and myocardial injury."

Here, we performed an integrated multilayered screening for pathogenic genes and druggable targets for MASH. We identified the subclass of metabolite-sensing G protein-coupled receptors, specifically GPR31, a critical contributor to MASH occurrence, which, to our knowledge, was previously uncharacterized. Mechanistically, Gαi3 is the essential downstream effector for the pro-MASH efficiency of GPR31 via glycosylation-dependent interaction with GPR31 and extra activation of PKCδ-MAPK signaling. Hepatocyte-specific GPR31 deficiency robustly blocked hepatic lipotoxicity and fibrosis in a mouse model of diet-induced MASH, whereas expression of the GPR31 transgene aggravated MASH development. Of translational importance, we developed a small-molecule inhibitor, named G4451, that specifically inhibits the GPR31-Gαi3 interaction by targeting the GPR31 conformational transition. Encouragingly, oral administration of G4451 effectively blocked MASH progression in preclinical models in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Collectively, the present study provides proof of concept that interference with GPR31 constitutes an attractive therapeutic strategy for MASH."

We described all BEST1 variants identified in French patients analyzed at Lille University Hospital, between 2008 and 2024. A comprehensive analysis of each variant was performed based on in silico tools (at DNA, RNA, and protein levels), as well as a literature review providing clinical data and functional assays. All of these data were used to classify the variant pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria.\n\nRESULTS: We detailed 488 variants from the LOVD. Among 450 French patients, we identified 150 different variants, 40 of which were novel. We classified only eight variants as variants of unknown significance, four of which were already in the LOVD. We identified specific recurrent variants in the French population: p.(Gly26Asp), p.(Val90Met), p.(Val137Met), and p.(Ile230del), the last of which was present in 17 patients (3.8%). All new variants cause changes in chemical interactions within the protein and are associated with clinical pictures of bestrophinopathy.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The study and comparison of these two large cohorts highlight variants specific to the French population, as well as differences in protein distribution, which are undoubtedly influenced by several population-specific factors.

Here, we found that arrestin domain containing 4 (ARRDC4), a critical regulator of glucose metabolism, senses influenza A virus (IAV) infection by interacting with viral PA protein. Upregulated ARRDC4 increases the enzymatic activity of phosphofructokinase, muscle type (PFKM) via binding its His298 site to promote the production of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). Consequently, FBP inhibits the K48-linked ubiquitination degradation of HSP90β, subsequently enhances its interaction with IKKβ and IKKε, and enhances NF-κB- and IRF7-mediated antiviral innate immunity, respectively. Importantly, FBP supplementation enhanced IFN-β-mediated antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings highlight a unique immunometabolic regulatory mechanism in which ARRDC4 senses IAV infection and regulates antiviral innate immunity through the PFKM-FBP metabolic axis and provide a strategy for manipulating FBP-related metabolism to treat viral infection."

The isolation and purification of EVs from biological samples are prerequisites for EV research.

In aqueous two-phase laminar flow, EVs with hydrophilic surfaces selectively migrate from the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) phase to the dextran (DEX) phase, which is accelerated by Dean flow. However, the proteins were still retained in the PEG phase due to the laminar effect and their surface properties. The separation performance of the DATPEC was investigated using breast cancer-derived EVs, and 91.1% EVs could be recovered from the cell culture medium supernatant with a protein removal rate of 95.6%. As a proof of concept, this technique was coupled with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to analyze surface proteins (EpCAM and EGFR) of EVs derived from eight cell lines. Fluorescent aptamers were specifically labeled on EVs, revealing the single-vesicle heterogeneity. In conclusion, DATPEC enables simple and efficient separation of high-purity EVs and exhibits the potential to be integrated with downstream techniques for EV analysis."

Deep mutational scanning (DMS) is a powerful biochemical experimental technique that can characterize the impact of mutations on protein sequence-function relationships, allowing for rapid assessment of new mutations. Herein, machine learning (ML) models were built using the SARS-CoV-2 DMS data set, with the input features derived from the Rosetta-computed decomposition energy terms. To improve the performance of this physics-based model, we further incorporated local environment information (the number of residue pair-specific contacts within shells at different distances) as the input features. Alternatively, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on amino-acid sequence information as well as their physicochemical and biochemical properties was also employed, yielding predictions that achieved good agreement with the experimental data. In addition, compared to three popular protein language models, the dual-encoding CNN model demonstrated consistently superior performance on the SARS-CoV-2 DMS data set and seven additional DMS data sets for different biological properties. Furthermore, a transfer-learning strategy was applied to fine-tune the CNN model using recently reported DMS data sets for the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.2, and XBB.1.5 variants, enabling the development of variant-specific prediction models. These ML models trained on DMS data sets can not only identify the effects of single-point mutations in mutagenesis data sets but also be useful in predicting the effects of multiple-point mutations and providing valuable information for ongoing viral surveillance efforts. Moreover, this dual-encoding CNN model, without including 3D geometric information, has the potential to be a robust and alternative ML model for other DMS studies."

    "text": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a genetic muscle disease caused by ectopic expression of the toxic protein DUX4, resulting in muscle weakness. However, the mechanism by which DUX4 exerts its toxicity remains unclear. In this study, we observed abnormal iron accumulation in muscles of patients with FSHD and in mice with muscle-specific DUX4 expression (DUX4-Tg mice). Treatment with iron chelators, an iron-deficient diet, and genetic modifications inhibiting intracellular uptake of iron did not improve but rather exacerbated FSHD pathology in DUX4-Tg mice. Unexpectedly, however, iron supplementation, from either a high-iron diet or intravenous iron administration, resulted in remarkable improvement in grip strength and running performance in DUX4-Tg mice. Iron supplementation suppressed abnormal iron accumulation and the ferroptosis-related pathway involving increased lipid peroxidation in DUX4-Tg muscle. Muscle-specific DUX4 expression led to retinal vasculopathy, a part of FSHD pathology, which was prevented by iron administration. Furthermore, high-throughput compound screening of the ferroptosis pathway identified drug candidates including ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. Treatment with Fer-1 dramatically improved physical function in DUX4-Tg mice. Our findings demonstrate that DUX4-provoked toxicity is involved in the activation of the ferroptosis-related pathway and that supplementary iron could be a promising and readily available therapeutic option for FSHD."

While it is well established that genetic mutations that disrupt the structural integrity of the DGC result in numerous muscular dystrophies, the 3D structure of the complex has remained elusive. Two recent elegant cryoEM structures of the DGC illuminate its molecular architecture and reveal the unique structural placement of sarcospan (SSPN) within the complex. SSPN, a 25 kDa tetraspanin-like protein, anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, supporting the conclusions of biochemical studies that SSPN is a core element for DGC assembly and stabilization. Here, we advance these studies by revealing that SSPN provides scaffolding in δ-sarcoglycanopathies, enabling substitution of δ-sarcoglycan by its homolog, ζ-sarcoglycan, leading to the structural integrity of the DGC and prevention of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R5. Three-dimensional modeling reveals that ζ-sarcoglycan preserves protein-protein interactions with the sarcospan, sarcoglycans, dystroglycan, and dystrophin. The structural integrity of the complex maintains myofiber attachment to the extracellular matrix and protects the cell membrane from contraction-induced damage. These findings demonstrate that sarcospan prevents limb-girdle muscular dystrophy R5 by remodeling of the sarcoglycan complex composition."

Sarcomas are molecularly heterogeneous with a high propensity for metastasis, resulting in poor clinical outcomes. BET inhibitors (BETi) hold promise for the treatment of sarcomas, for they block interaction of BETs with acetylated lysines, modify gene expression, and create an imbalance in transcription and replication kinetics. BETis also disrupt transcriptional programs driven by oncogenic fusion proteins found in some sarcomas. Preclinical studies demonstrate efficacy of BETis in inducing apoptosis, disrupting DDR, and reducing tumor growth, either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy or other targeted agents, such as PI3K, histone deacetylases, and CHK1 inhibitors. Favorable results have been observed in clinical trials, but more studies are required to fully assess safety and efficacy as well as identify biomarkers of response and resistance. Ongoing research is focused on optimizing BETi safety and selectivity and exploring combination therapies, such as BETis with DDR inhibitors. This review summarizes the preclinical studies on BET inhibition and discusses clinical trial activity, providing insights into the potential of BETis in sarcoma therapy."

Studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of the anticaries vaccination, including the dose, plasmids, serum IgG and IgA levels after immunization, were included. Studies in which animals were used for anticaries vaccine were also included. Combining more than one trial was done to estimate the pooled intervention effect using the meta-analysis when studies examined the same intervention and outcomes with comparable methods in similar populations. The continuous data was pooled using the inverse variance method, and dichotomous data using the Mantel-Haenszel method.\n\nRESULTS: Out of 4701 records, only 17 publications met the eligibility criteria. Although all studies were assessed as having an overall low risk of bias, certain domains (D3, D5, and D7) exhibited a high risk across most studies. The pooled RR, derived using a random-effects model, was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.46-0.62), indicating a statistically significant 47% reduction in risk across studies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: There is excellent potential for dental caries vaccines to transform oral health in the future. Various vaccines, such as Killed Formalin-treated Donor strain 2 - recombinant Protein Antigen c and anti-CAT-SYIIgY antibodies, have demonstrated prophylactic effects against Streptococcus mutans colonization on teeth. These interventions exhibit a sustained reduction in S. mutans colonization, which may contribute to the prevention of dental caries. A vaccination of this kind would significantly lower tooth decay prevalence and the financial and health costs that go along with it."

    "text": "Specific protein detection plays a crucial role in biological analysis and clinical diagnostics， serving as an essential tool for disease diagnosis， therapeutic monitoring， and biological research. However， conventional methods such as immunofixation electrophoresis （IFE） and western blotting （WB） suffer from complex workflows， time-consuming operations， and limited quantification capabilities owing to intricate staining and de-staining procedures. In addition， these traditional immunological detection methods require extensive manual handling and specialized expertise， while low levels of automation restrict their applicability to high-throughput or large-scale analysis scenarios. Moreover， the multistep nature of these methods increases the risk of experimental errors and compromises quantification accuracy.Herein， we present a quantitative protein immune polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis （PAGE） detection method that combines immune-recognition principles with online fluorescence imaging technology， thereby offering a rapid and specific approach for quantifying target proteins. The developed method exploits the specificity of fluorescently labeled antibodies and the separation capability of PAGE， with formaldehyde crosslinking used to stabilize antigen-antibody complexes under the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis， thereby ensuring reliable quantification. The entire experimental workflow can be completed within 1.5 h and consists of three main steps. Firstly， the target protein is incubated with fluorescently labeled antibodies at room temperature for 0.5 h to form immune complexes， after which they are crosslinked using formaldehyde. The cross-linked samples are then loaded onto polyacrylamide gels and separated under optimized electrophoresis conditions （120 V， 15 min； 150 V， 15 min； 200 V， 15 min）. Electrophoretic separation is finally monitored in real-time using an online fluorescence imaging system， which enables direct visualization of protein migration and eliminates the need for post-separation processing. Three distinct bands are observed on the precast gel following immune PAGE separation： the immune complexes at the uppermost position， the free fluorescent antibodies in the middle， and other proteins at the bottom. ImageJ software is used to analyze the electrophoresis pattern， and quantification is achieved based on the linear relationship between the fluorescence intensity of the free antibody and the mass concentration of the target protein. We systematically validated the performance of the method using human transferrin （TRF） as the model antigen protein and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-labeled （FITC-labeled） anti-TRF IgG antibody （anti-TRF IgG-FITC） as the detection probe， which involved analyzing three key aspects： the necessity of the formaldehyde-crosslinking step for maintaining immune complex stability， antibody recognition specificity in complex samples， and the linear correlation between the fluorescence signal and the mass concentration of the target protein. The method exhibited excellent analytical performance， with a linear range that extended between 5.0 and 200.0 mg/L and a correlation coefficient （"

Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the optimal cutoff value of the risk score. Subsequently, survival analysis was conducted in the training group (TCGA-OV) and external databases (GSE26712 and GSE63885), with the predictive efficiency of the risk signature evaluated through ROC curves.\n\nRESULTS: Prognosis was significantly better for patients in the low-risk group than in the high-risk group. Compared to single clinical features such as age and stage, the risk score had the highest diagnostic value for prognostic evaluation. Based on gene function and pathway analyses, differential genes were found to be related to oxidative stress. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that risk scores were associated with immunosuppressive cells such as M2 macrophages. Finally, the protein expression levels of the key gene CREB3 in OC tissues were evaluated in vitro.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study might provide significant value for exploring the relationship between disulfidptosis-related ferroptosis genes and OC, and its results may provide insights on new therapeutic targets for OC."

In humans, BMs also contain over 150 other secreted proteins, such as structural matrix components, enzymes and growth factors, as well as over 50 cell-membrane adhesion and signalling receptors. From this toolbox, BMs are tailored for tissue-specific functions, including filtration, shaping organs, connecting tissues and harbouring signals that guide cell migration and differentiation.

In Silico virtual screening suggested that prunetin (PRU) may activate GPER1 and inhibit RUNX2. To validate these findings in vivo, male Sprague Dawley rats were allocated into five groups: placebo-surgery (PS), PRU-treated PS, untreated UE, PRU-treated UE, and UE pretreated with G-15 (a selective GPER1 blocker) before PRU. Biochemically, PRU significantly restored hippocampal structure and behavioral functions impaired by UE, reduced serum IS levels, and replenished GPER1 expression. Additionally, it suppressed p-AKT, p-GSK3β, RUNX2, TLR4, and NF-κB, while enhancing cell survival by silencing the necroptotic signal (TICAM1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL) and restoring caspase-8. PRU also counteracted mitochondrial dysfunction by downregulating PGAM5 and p-DRP-1. Crucially, these beneficial effects were nullified by G-15, confirming the role of activated GPER1 in mediating PRU's therapeutic effects. Collectively, PRU-induced GPER1 orchestrated neural integrity signal UE/AKT/GSK-3β/RUNX2, inflammatory axis UE/TLR-4/NF-κB, necroptosis pathway (TICAM1/RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL), preventing mitochondrial dysfunction by suppressing the PGAM5/DRP-1 cue.

    "text": "Aging is the foremost risk factor for metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis, which is a principal cause of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Vascular endothelial cells (ECs), which line the vascular intima, play a central role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Their dysfunction, marked by impaired barrier function, inflammation, and metabolic dysregulation, constitutes an early and pivotal event in atherogenesis. As key sensors of hemodynamic forces, ECs are constantly exposed to blood flow-induced shear stress, which exert divergent effects on metabolism depending on the flow pattern. Laminar flow with relatively high shear stress (LS), as a critical atheroprotective factor, maintains EC quiescence and promotes anti-inflammatory responses and antioxidant defense, whereas disturbed flow with low and oscillatory shear stress (OS), induces the athero-susceptible signaling network to activate glycolysis and inflammation in ECs. While genetic, epigenetic, and molecular signaling mechanisms in EC physiology and pathophysiology have been extensively explored, the crucial role of EC metabolism in EC dysfunction and atherogenesis remains largely understudied. By serving as precursors, intermediates, and end products of cellular processes, metabolites offer a dynamic snapshot of endothelial metabolic states under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. With aging, ECs undergo profound metabolic reprogramming, including disrupted glycolysis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered redox homeostasis. In healthy vasculature, ECs maintain quiescence and metabolic homeostasis, primarily relying on glycolysis for energy. With aging, the gradual accumulation of atherosclerotic risk factors, including oxidative stress, inflammation, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia, drives metabolic reprogramming in ECs, particularly in regions exposed to disturbed flow with OS, ultimately leading to EC dysfunction and atherosclerosis. This review summarizes recent advances in age-related metabolic reprogramming in ECs and its contribution to atherosclerosis, particularly focusing on the dysregulation of glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and mitochondrial respiration induced by age and fluid shear stress. This review also outlines recent methodologies for profiling EC metabolism, and discusses potential therapeutic applications of targeting EC metabolism to prevent or delay the development of atherosclerosis."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of tolvaptan on inflammatory markers and renal progression in ADPKD patients. This retrospective, two-center cohort study included 80 ADPKD patients, with 40 receiving tolvaptan and 40 serving as controls. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), systemic inflammatory index (SII), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and renal function parameters such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria, were analyzed over a 1-year follow-up period. In the tolvaptan group, CRP, SII, PLR, proteinuria, and uric acid levels significantly decreased, whereas these markers increased in the control group. GFR remained stable in the tolvaptan group but declined significantly in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant correlation was found between GFR and inflammatory markers in either group. Our findings suggest that tolvaptan may contribute to reducing systemic inflammation in ADPKD patients while preserving renal function.

TIGIT mediates its inhibitory effect by direct signaling through the cytoplasmic tail, CD155-mediated inhibition, or competition with the immune-activating receptor CD226. Preclinical observations from studies involving TIGIT-specific blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are promising, but the results of the clinical trials using anti-TIGIT mAb monotherapy were not favorable, which prompted a focus on combinational therapies. Some alternative approaches have the potential to avoid limitations, including low penetration, immunogenicity and safety of mAbs.

    "text": "PURPOSE: The optimal management for neonatal intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) remains uncertain. Neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL) has gained interest as a method for removal of intraventricular haematoma and debris, with outcomes suggesting it to be safe and efficacious for reducing the requirement for ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion. We present a large series assessing outcomes from NEL for neonatal IVH.\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective review was carried out, between January 2011 and November 2023, identifying infants who underwent NEL following germinal matrix haemorrhage at our institution. Data was extracted on patient baseline demographics, comorbidities, complications, re-operation rate, and VPS requirement.\n\nRESULTS: Forty-four patients (28 M:16F) underwent NEL at a median corrected age of 35\n\nCONCLUSIONS: NEL is a safe and potentially efficacious treatment for neonatal IVH. The procedure may reduce shunt dependence, particularly if performed earlier in the disease process."

We aimed to describe the usual intakes of nutrients and their adequacy compared to estimated average requirements in three target groups; children aged 2-5 years, adolescent girls aged 10-18 years, and women aged 19-49 years in the regions of Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, Tillabéri, and Zinder in Niger.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted the first quantitative food consumption survey in Niger. Specifically, we used 24-hour recalls to estimate foods consumed the previous day and carried out a repeat recall on 20% of the sample to model usual daily intakes using the National Cancer Institute method. We selected representative samples of each age group in the five administrative regions studied.\n\nRESULTS: We included 1209 children aged 2-5 years, 1105 adolescent girls aged 10-18 years, and 1053 women aged 19-49 years. The median total energy intake was 1413 kcal (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1118, 1748) for children, 2227 kcal (95% CI = 1714, 2826) for adolescents, and 2552 kcal (95%CI = 1981, 3226) for women. The average proportion of energy from carbohydrates was above 69% for all target groups, while fat and protein accounted for just 20% and 10% in all groups, respectively. Animal protein accounted for only 11% of total protein intake in children, compared with 9.15% in adolescent girls and 9.78% in women. Usual calcium, vitamin B12, and vitamin A intakes were far below estimated average requirements, regardless of the target group or region.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Considering the risk related to very high micronutrient deficiencies, particularly in calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin 12, urgent action needs to be taken in Niger through the accelerated implementation of the national roadmap on transforming local food systems for healthy diets."

Quantifying these components is essential for ensuring the nutritional quality of IF. The review evaluates the sensitivity, specificity, and applicability of different analytical techniques when applied to a complex matrix (i.e., IF), highlighting the advantages and limitations inherent in each approach. Although numerous methods exist for quantifying the different NPN components, not all are rigorously validated. Additionally, many methods fail to adequately account for matrix effects, which can lead to significant discrepancies in reported values. This review underscores the importance of selecting validated analytical approaches that consider matrix effects to obtain reliable data on NPN components in IF. By enhancing the understanding of NPN quantification in infant nutrition, this work aims to highlight the importance of standardized and validated analytical protocols, thereby improving consistency in the identification and quantification of key NPN components in IF."

Despite its severity and aggressive nature, biomarkers that can serve as prognostic and predictive factors for ccRCC are lacking. ABCD3, a peroxisomal long-chain fatty acid transporter, has been shown to serve as a prognostic factor in both prostate and colon cancers. Thus, this study aimed to ascertain if ABCD3, which is highly expressed in kidney tissues, may also serve as a biomarker for renal cancer.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioinformatics and immunohistochemical staining were employed to systematically investigate the relationship between the ABCD3 gene and protein expression, the immune microenvironment, and survival outcomes in ccRCC. We extensively harnessed data from publicly available databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TGCA), UALCAN, Gene Set Cancer Analysis, UCSC Xena, and various other databases.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ABCD3 is a novel biomarker for ccRCC and that the downregulation of ABCD3 expression, and other members of the peroxisomal VLCFA oxidation pathway may represent a unique molecular feature of ccRCC."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is the most life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). AH is characterized by severe inflammation attributed to increased levels of ethanol, microbes or microbial components, and damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecules in the liver. HSPB1 [Heat Shock Protein Family B (Small) Member 1; also known as Hsp25/27] is a DAMP released from stressed cells, including hepatocytes. The goal of this study was to define the role of HSPB1 in AH pathophysiology.\n\nMETHODS: Serum HSPB1 was measured in a retrospective study of 184 healthy controls (HCs), heavy alcohol consumers (HA), patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis (AC), and patients with AH recruited from major hospital centers.HSPB1 was also evaluated in liver tissue from HC and AH patients, existing RNA-seq data from ALD patient liver and monocytes, and livers from mice fed a Lieber-DeCarli diet. Cellular models of hepatocyte and macrophage interactions were used to evaluate the role of HSPB1 in inflammation during AH.\n\nRESULTS: Circulating HSPB1 was significantly increased in AH patients, and levels positively correlated with disease-severity scores. HSPB1 was also increased in the livers of patients with severe AH and ethanol-fed mice. In cellular models, ethanol-stressed hepatocytes released HSPB1, which then triggered TNFα-mediated inflammation in macrophages. Anti-HSPB1 antibody prevented TNFα release from macrophages exposed to media conditioned by ethanol-stressed hepatocytes.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings support investigation of HSPB1 as both a biomarker and therapeutic target in ALD. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that anti-HSPB1 antibody is a rational approach to targeting HSPB1 with the potential to block inflammation and protect hepatocytes, without inactivating host defense."

    "text": "The fermented botanical product (FBP) is a complex, primarily plant-based fermented food that has been popular among consumers for many years. Although FBP may modulate gastrointestinal function, the responsible factors and precise mechanisms remain unclear and speculative. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained widespread attention as a novel signaling system, not only in animals but also in plants and microorganisms. Here, we report that FBP contains EV-like nanoparticles composed of protein complexes originating from various lactic acid bacteria. When mice consumed the EV-like nanoparticle-enriched fraction of FBP as a beverage for three weeks, their body weight gain was reduced by up to approximately 10%, particularly in those fed a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet. Although the HF/HS diet induced colonic atrophy in mice, the ingestion of the EV-like nanoparticles-enriched fraction of FBP increased lipid efflux in feces by more than two-fold and improved the pathological images of the colon. In vitro experiments on lipase activity suggested lipase inhibitory activity in the EV-like nanoparticle-enriched fraction of FBP. Compound analyses revealed that ferulic acid was enriched in the EV-like nanoparticle fraction and inhibited lipase activity in vitro. The biological effects observed in this study were attenuated by reducing the amount of EV-like nanoparticles using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane. However, the slight reduction (not statistically significant) in bioactivity in the PTFE-treated group compared with the polyether sulfone (PES) treated group, despite a marked decrease in ferulic acid content, suggests the possible involvement of additional molecules beyond EV-like nanoparticles in this fraction. These findings indicate that FBP may serve as a potential therapeutic option for obesity and gastric symptoms. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Extracellular vesicle-like nanoparticles in FBP may support health by alleviating obesity through the suppression of excessive intestinal lipid uptake. These findings suggest that FBP could be developed into a functional food or supplement for individuals who frequently consume high-fat diets."

    "text": "Melatonin, an indolamine primarily recognized for regulating circadian rhythms, has also demonstrated notable antitumoral properties. Melatonin induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, modulates autophagy, and promotes apoptosis in various tumors, including gastric, ovarian, cervical, oral tongue, colorectal, renal, hepatic, and bladder cancer. In placental choriocarcinoma, melatonin reduces cell viability and induces apoptosis by inhibiting autophagy and disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential. However, its effects on ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway remain unexplored. It is hypothesized here that the proapoptotic effects of melatonin in choriocarcinoma cells occur through the activation of the UPR pathway. The factors implicated in the UPR (PERK, IRE1ɑ, ATF6, GRP78, ATF4, CHOP, P-eIF2α) pathways were evaluated by Western blot, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry in BeWo (human choriocarcinoma) cells treated with or without melatonin (1 mM). Melatonin significantly increased protein levels of GRP78 (p = 0.0329), IRE1α (p = 0.0394), p-eIF2α (p = 0.0439), ATF4 (p = 0.0267), CHOP (p = 0.0379), Bax and cleaved PARP but did not affect TRAF2 and NFkB protein levels nor XBP1 mRNA splicing. PERK knockdown, via siRNA, prevented the rise in GRP78, p-eIF2α/eIF2α, and ATF4 levels by melatonin. Additionally, melatonin increased early apoptosis in BeWo cells (p = 0.0371) and PERK knockdown increased the susceptibility of BeWo cells to apoptosis when treated with tunicamycin (p = 0.0359), suggesting that ER stress plays a role in BeWo cell survival. This study demonstrates that melatonin activates the PERK-ATF4-P-eIF2α-CHOP pathway and induces early apoptosis in BeWo cells, while PERK deficiency compromises cell survival under ER stress. Our findings suggest that modulating PERK-UPR signaling with melatonin could present a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer, including placental choriocarcinoma."

However, traditional prognostic models based on stage alone cannot meet clinical needs. This study aims to establish a clinlabomics-based, highly accessible prognostic model for small cell lung cancer.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a multicenter observational retrospective study, enrolling clinical laboratory data of 276 small cell lung cancer patients. The cohort from Sichuan Cancer Hospital comprised a total of 196 samples. Of these, 88 samples were designated as the internal validation set, while 80 samples from an alternate institution were allocated as the external independent validation set. Utilizing the log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, six prognostic indicators were discerned. A nomogram was subsequently developed based on these identified indicators.\n\nRESULTS: Through the log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, total protein (TP) (HR = 0.47, p < 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (HR = 1.82, p < 0.001), and lymphocyte ratio (Lym ratio) (HR = 0.47, p = 0.005) were identified as laboratory biomarkers related to prognosis from 61 blood-related laboratory tests, covering routine blood, biochemical, coagulation, and infectious disease markers, while age, stage, and smoking were identified as clinical independent prognostic factors. A nomogram was developed based on these six indicators. The AUC of time-independent ROC for 2- and 3-year overall survival (OS) was 0.74, 0.74 in the training cohort, and 0.64, 0.74 in the validation cohort, respectively. The novel nomogram accurately predicted the prognosis for two independent cohorts with p values < 0.001 and performed risk adjustment, which classified patients with different OS at the same extensive stage (ES) or limited-stage (LS).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinlabomics-based nomogram helps to more effectively predict the prognosis of small cell lung cancer by leveraging blood laboratory data."

It has been shown that eCIRP is linked to various types of programmed cell death and acute inflammation. However, the role of eCIRP in chronic inflammation and renal fibrosis has not been elucidated. Accumulating evidence indicates that renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) play a significant role in renal fibrosis. C23, a small molecular peptide inhibitor of eCIRP, has been implicated as a therapeutic agent in the context of acute inflammation and tissue injury. PANoptosis or synchronized cell death is observed as simultaneous triggering of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. However, its role in renal fibrosis is not known. We therefore hypothesize that eCIRP induced-chronic inflammation and injury in RTECs are mediated by PANoptosis and that inhibition of eCIRP by C23 decreases RTEC PANoptosis and attenuates renal injury and fibrosis in a mouse model of unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) injury. By using primary RTECs, we demonstrated that eCIRP induces inflammatory cytokines, Z-DNA-binding protein-1, and other PANoptosome markers and markers of apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. We then substantiated that C23 downregulated proinflammatory cytokines and inhibited PANoptosis in the RTECs. Using the UUO mouse model, we demonstrated renal cell PANoptosis and renal fibrosis 7 days after UUO. Importantly, treatment with C23 effectively inhibited PANoptosis and concurrently ameliorated renal fibrosis. Taken together, eCIRP induces inflammation and PANoptosis in RTECs, whereas C23 inhibits PANoptosis in these cells and attenuates renal fibrosis in UUO mice."

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate predictive performance.\n\nRESULTS: High GATA3 expression (≥ 60%) was detected in 92.5% of cases. Elevated GATA3 levels were significantly associated with reduced PFS and OS. IPTW-adjusted Cox regression confirmed high GATA3 expression as an independent adverse prognostic factor. ROC curve analysis demonstrated strong predictive performance for CMF progression (AUC = 0.867), with an optimal cutoff of 57.5% (sensitivity 73.7%, specificity 94.3%). For clinical applicability, a 60% threshold was adopted.\n\nCONCLUSION: High GATA3 expression is an independent adverse prognostic biomarker in early-stage CMF.

    "text": "The internalization of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) occurs in response to VEGF treatment, and it is eventually transported to the plasma membrane by several endosomes such as Rab5 and Rab11, which are responsible for transporting vesicles from the cytoplasm to plasma membrane. Therefore, the homeostasis of VEGFR-2 internalization and recycling is critical for maintaining the normality of the VEGF signaling pathway and regulates angiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that discoidin, CUB and LCCL domain containing 2 (DCBLD2) can promote the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) by promoting the VEGF signaling pathway, but the potential role of DCBLD2 on VEGFR-2 endocytosis remains unclear. Herein, we found that the deletion of Dcbld2 in mice pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) interfered in progression of VEGFR-2-positive vesicles in cytoplasm returning to the membrane, which functioned by increasing the association of VEGFR-2 with Rab5, while decreasing the association with Rab11. Knockdown of DCBLD2 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) impaired VEGFR-2 recycling in the same way as that in PMVECs. The deletion of Rab5 in WT PMVECs further attenuated VEGFR-2 signaling induced by VEGF, and overexpression of Rab11 in PMVECs with Dcbld2 deletion showed recovery of VEGF-induced signaling. Finally, EC-specific Dcbld2 knockout mice showed that DCBLD2 plays a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis. As a receptor-regulating protein, DCBLD2 accelerates the process of VEGFR-2 returning to membrane, which promotes VEGF signaling in ECs and promotes angiogenesis in mice, potentially presenting to be a new therapeutic target for cardiovascular diseases associated with EC damage."

Today, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) enhances skin quality by promoting collagen synthesis, elasticity, and hydration. Minimal invasive aesthetic treatment could add value to this patient group.\n\nMETHODS: To assess the relationship between menopause, hormones, and HRT on skin health, we conducted a comprehensive literature search using the terms (menopause OR menopausal) AND (aging OR aging) AND (skin) AND (estrogen OR estrogen OR hormones) AND (hormone replacement therapy OR HRT). To explore aesthetic treatments specific to menopausal women, searches included (\"menopause\" OR \"menopausal\") AND (\"aesthetics\" OR \"aesthetics\" OR \"cosmetic\" OR \"filler\"). Additional studies were identified from references in the uncovered articles.\n\nRESULTS: We reviewed the impact of hypoestrogenism and HRT on menopausal skin and identified unmet needs in its aesthetic management. Most studies reported positive associations between HRT and improvements in menopausal skin aging, but findings were sometimes inconsistent. Despite decades of research, clinical guidelines do not support HRT use solely for estrogen-deficient skin due to a lack of robust clinical trials on skin-specific therapy. Many women remain unaware of the skin-related impacts of menopause, which can affect quality of life, and few aesthetics studies analyze data based on menopausal status or HRT use. Given the growing demand for aesthetic treatments in this population, future studies should intentionally incorporate demographic data and analyses on menopausal status and HRT use."

    "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder that affects multiple organs, with clinical manifestations, disease progression, and response to therapy varying among individuals. This effect is mainly caused by mutations in the gene encoding for the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cAMP-regulated chloride channel. In recent decades, other genes and their allelic variants, beyond CFTR mutations, have been proposed as genetic modifiers of CF phenotype. For instance, different polymorphic β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) polymorphic variants have been reported in CF individuals and appear to influence correct receptor function. β2AR belongs to the βAR family, which includes three subtypes: β1AR, β2AR, and β3AR. These receptors are crucial G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types and serve as key modulators of cAMP production, making their function particularly relevant in CF pathophysiology. β2AR is abundantly expressed in airway epithelial and smooth muscle cells, and studies revealed that it plays a crucial role in modulating CFTR activity and smooth muscle contractility through cAMP signaling. For these reasons, β2-agonists are widely used in clinical healthcare to treat patients with obstructive airway disorders, including CF. Emerging evidence has also supported a role for β3AR, which is expressed in the canine and human bronchial epithelium and have been reported to enhance ciliary motility and regulate CFTR function, making it a potential therapeutic target in CF."

We aimed to investigate the accuracy of plasma Follistatin-like protein 1 (FSTL-1) in the diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases.\n\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: We collected cross-sectional clinical data for a derivation cohort (n = 86) and a validation cohort (n = 431), totaling 517 subjects with liver biopsy. Advanced liver fibrosis was defined by the METAVIR pathological score (F ≥3). Dual cutoff values for diagnosis were explored. In the derivation cohort, plasma FSTL-1 levels were significantly elevated in patients with advanced liver fibrosis, with an AUROC of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.75-0.96). In the validation cohort, plasma FSTL-1 maintained good diagnostic performance, with an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83-0.92). Plasma FSTL-1 levels were significantly associated with individual histological features of the METAVIR scoring system, including interface hepatitis, lobular necrosis, and hepatocellular ballooning (p < 0.0001). A cutoff value ≤ 0.43 ng/mL was the optimal rule-out threshold, with a sensitivity of 84.62% (95% CI, 76.46%-90.30%) and a specificity of 79.51% (95% CI, 74.81%-83.53%), while ≥0.50 ng/mL was the best rule-in threshold, with a specificity of 86.41% (95% CI, 81.06%-90.43%) and a sensitivity of 70.67% (95% CI, 64.41%-76.23%).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Plasma FSTL-1 has high diagnostic accuracy and could potentially reduce the need for liver biopsy in identifying patients with advanced liver fibrosis."

Conventional MRI captures morphologic changes in neurodegeneration, while quantitative MRI (qMRI) provides biophysical measures of microstructural alterations. Combining these modalities may reveal how aging and pathology interact and contribute to disability progression in people with MS.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional and longitudinal morphometry data from 1,353 patients with MS and 3,462 healthy controls (HCs). In addition, cross-sectional qMRI data, available for 378 HCs and 169 patients with MS, were analyzed separately. Morphometric measures and quantitative metrics were used to estimate brain-predicted age differences (brain-PADs) with machine learning. We assessed the added value of quantitative metrics over a model based exclusively on morphometric measures in brain age prediction. We also investigated the associations of brain-PADs derived from conventional and qMRI-based predictive models with clinical disability, serum inflammatory biomarkers of neuroaxonal and astrocytic injury, and lesion burden.\n\nRESULTS: Models combining morphometry and qMRI data achieved the best performance (mean absolute error: 5.73), outperforming those based on qMRI (6.62) or morphometry alone (8.00).

Currently, antibiotics are highly preferred to address underlying problems; however, their misuse has led to antibacterial resistance and compromised biocompatibility. This underscores the need for an advanced biological macromolecule-based system with multifunctional properties. Herein, we report a gelatin-based hydrogel dressing integrated with MXene and zingerone (GPM Z) to manage open wounds. Nanocomposite hydrogels demonstrated porous networks, hydrophilic nature, and rheological behavior, ensuring their reliability in a physiological environment. The sustained release of zingerone from hydrogels promotes prolonged therapeutic effects while minimizing side effects associated with burst release. In vitro analysis confirms >80 % antioxidant potential as determined by DPPH assay, hemolysis (<5 %), n-HDF cells compatibility, and antibacterial activity of nanocomposite hydrogels, which can be tuned by varying MXene concentration in hydrogels. In vivo analysis highlights the effectiveness of GPM-5 Z hydrogel in facilitating wound closure (98.75 % by day 14). The synergistic interplay of MXene and zingerone enhances wound healing by combining MXene antibacterial potential and bio interactive surface supporting cell proliferation with zingerone antioxidant activity that mitigates oxidative stress, thereby facilitating collagen deposition, re-epithelialization, and angiogenesis."

While our frequency-based approach effectively differentiated MHC-I from MHC-II TCRs in cross-validation, performance declined when only beta chain data were used from real-world peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples. However, incorporating the TCR alpha chain significantly improved accuracy, emphasizing its importance for MHC recognition.

    "text": "Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as NASH, represents one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Its high prevalence is driven by insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with cardiovascular disease. The main driver of liver damage is fat accumulation in hepatocytes leading to inflammation and fibrosis development. People with MASH and clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2/F3) are 'at risk' of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and are considered in need of treatment. Metabolic drivers of MASH originating outside the liver, for example, from the adipose tissue and the gut, and genetic heterogeneity contribute to making the prevalent pathogenetic factor difficult to dissect at an individual level. In this scenario, the Food and Drug Administration's conditional approval of the liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist Resmetirom as the first pharmacological treatment for MASH last March 2024 and the expected extension of the glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonist Semaglutide indication from diabetes and obesity to MASH mark a key milestone. Both drugs are also under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency. The proven efficacy of these compounds in clinical trials needs to be balanced against safety profiles and patient preferences. To investigate future trajectories and possible uses as mono-therapy or in combination, we examined available results of clinical trials and real-life studies. Despite the need to await the final results of outcome studies to exclude any possible challenges for both compounds, safety profiles and external factors including reimbursement policies or supply limitations may currently guide the individual choice."

Biocompatible sericin, sericin nanoparticles, and sericin coupled with a phytate chelator were developed and meticulously characterized. In in-vitro assays, sericin modified with phytate demonstrated the most potent antioxidant activity (IC50: 39.5 μg/mL) and the highest calcium oxalate stone inhibition (∼92 %, IC50: 30.1 μg/mL). It also exhibited significant antibacterial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and uropathogenic E. coli. In-vivo studies revealed improvements in urinary, blood, and serum parameters, reduced renal crystal size, and absence of tissue toxicity, as confirmed by histopathological analysis. This is the first report demonstrating sericin's efficacy in the prevention and treatment of urolithiasis in a rat model. Sericin nanoparticles, especially those crosslinked with phytate (PASS-NP), effectively crossed the compromised glomerular filtration barrier, localized in renal tubules, and disrupted calcium oxalate crystallization. The enhanced activity is attributed to the synergistic effects of sericin's antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, and phytate's calcium-chelating and permeability-enhancing role. PASS-NP treatment showed significant crystal dissolution, reduced hematological disturbances, improved renal biomarkers, and strong antibacterial action against stone-promoting pathogens.

In this study, the cDNA sequence of an i-type lysozyme was obtained from Litopenaeus vannamei, and designated as LvLysi3. Following stimulation by Vibrio parahaemolyticus, transcripts of LvLysi3 in shrimp intestine, hepatopancreas and hemocytes was significantly up-regulated. Activity assays with recombinant protein showed LvLysi3 had agglutination activity and antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we found that LvLysi3 possessed high thermal stability and robust acid resistance, while also being non-toxic to human cells, ensuring the safety and potential application of this lysozyme as a feed additive. The incorporation of LvLysi3 into the feed could mitigate the detrimental effects of V. parahaemolyticus on L. vannamei by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Additionally, it promoted an increase in beneficial intestinal bacteria and reduced the abundance of V. parahaemolyticus. Moreover, feeding shrimp with LvLysi3 enhanced their innate immune response and facilitated pathogen phagocytosis by hemocytes, thereby decreasing the mortality rate associated with bacterial infections in shrimp.

Understanding the dynamics of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity in septic patients, particularly those with AKI, could improve the monitoring and prediction of renal outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate fluctuations in oxidative stress and antioxidant capacities in septic patients with and without AKI at the time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and one week later. In addition, it sought to investigate the potential correlation between specific oxidative stress and antioxidant markers and renal outcomes.\n\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional and follow-up study was conducted, involving 124 critically ill septic patients. The patients were divided into groups according to the presence of AKI at admission to the ICU. Epidemiological, clinical data, and biochemical measurements of oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity were collected on days 1 and 7 of ICU admission.\n\nRESULTS: The results indicated that plasma concentrations of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) were significantly higher in patients with AKI on both evaluation days. Notable differences in antioxidant capacities, including plasma glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase, were observed between the two groups. In patients with AKI, plasma oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity demonstrated a close relationship. Specifically, plasma GSH concentrations on day 1 were correlated with increased odds of major adverse kidney events within 14 and 28 days (MAKE14 and MAKE28), while elevated plasma GPx activities on day 7 were associated with reduced odds of MAKE14 and MAKE28.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Monitoring plasma GSH concentrations on the 1st day of ICU admission, in conjunction with the evaluation of plasma GPx activities on the 7th day, may serve as pivotal indicators for predicting renal outcomes in critically septic patients."

A 25(OH) vitamin D concentration ≤ 15 ng/mL was defined as vitamin D deficiency, within 15-30 ng/mL as vitamin D insufficiency, and > 30 ng/mL as serum 25(OH) vitamin D sufficiency. A hs-CRP level ≤ 2.5 mg/L was considered low, whereas a hs-CRP level > 2.5 mg/L was considered high. TNF-α was classified as low or high with an 8.2 pg/mL cutoff level based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. P values < 0.05 were considered to be significantly associated with albuminuria.\n\nRESULTS: Vitamin D deficiency was significantly more commonly observed among T2D patients with albuminuria than those without albuminuria (adjusted OR = 7.34, 95% CI = 2.3-23.6, p = 0.001). Higher serum TNF-α levels (TNF-α > 8.2 pg/mL) were more frequently associated with the presence of albuminuria in T2D patients (adjusted OR = 6.77, 95% CI = 1.61-28.4; p = 0.009). Similarly, elevated serum hs-CRP levels (hs-CRP > 2.5 mg/L) were more commonly found among patients with T2D and albuminuria than in those without (adjusted OR = 4.7, 95% CI = 1.4-15.8; p = 0.012).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency is a significant correlate of albuminuria in T2D patients, independent of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and basic inflammatory markers including hs-CRP and TNF-α. Moreover, serum hs-CRP > 2.5 mg/L and TNF-α > 8.2 pg/mL were each individually associated with a significantly increased likelihood of albuminuria in T2D patients."

    "text": "The Envelope (E)-protein is a key structural element of enveloped viruses that plays a significant role in host-pathogen interactions, viral growth, and hijacking of host innate immune system. Due to lack of antiviral agents and significant adverse effects and less affordability of vaccines, the E-protein targeted drug development is gaining critical attention among the researchers. The present review explores the structural and genomic diversities of E-protein among animal viruses with special interest to flaviviruses, coronaviruses, and herpesviruses. E-protein's viroporin activity damages host cell membrane and induces inflammation that advances the disease progression. The review also explains the viroporin-mediated NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs)-linked cellular mechanisms in virus-mediated inflammation. The E-protein is considered an alternative promising antiviral target as its functional domain is conserved. This review further enlists the natural, and synthetic inhibitors of E-protein in the development of antiviral agents based on computational, in vitro, and in vivo studies. The E-protein's universal conservation ability to fasten to cellular membranes and limited structural data imparts significant challenge to selective drug inhibition. The present review highlights that the E-protein together with multiple viral factors will boost treatment performance while minimising viral resistance. In addition, broad-range inhibitors targeting E-proteins have the potential to produce single treatment solutions in combating viral infections including several viral strains. In conclusion, E-protein targeted drug would be beneficial in developing potential antiviral agents with high drug specificity, and less viral resistance."

    "text": "In marine species, including bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, reptiles, and birds, arginase is the final enzyme in the urea cycle within the liver. This review aims to highlight the anticancer activity of these enzymes. The metalloenzyme L-arginase (also called L-arginine amidohydrolase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine into L-ornithine and urea. Up till now, L-methioninase has been partially studied in some bacterial species. It is necessary to study L-arginase and L-methioninase in marine microorganisms and to optimize cultivation conditions for both enzymes using the most potent isolates. Maximum activity of L-arginase occurs under optimal conditions when temperature, carbon and nitrogen sources, and L-arginine concentration are selected. The specific activity of the enzyme was 111.383 units/mg with a yield of 4.522 and a multiplicity of 5.622 % when precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 40 % saturation. Partially purified L-arginase was eluted from gel filtration with a multiplicity of 10.627 and a recovery of 7.132 %. L-arginase, derived from the submerged cultures of the heat-tolerant fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, exhibited strong resistance to high temperatures at 40 °C and displayed a threefold increase in its attraction to L-arginine (Km 4.8 mM). The substrate specificity of the enzyme was evaluated against different substrates such as L-arginine and L-asparginine. The enzyme showed good affinity to L-arginine with 112 U/mL. It was found to have very low specificity for d-arginine and least specificity for others. The enzyme showed higher antiproliferative activity on Jurkat cell lines, clone E6-1, compared to other tested cell lines. These changes reflect significant differences in the regulation of biochemical processes, which is obviously manifested in the possibilities of survival and development in a particular environment and can be considered a manifestation of \"biochemical adaptation\" to certain environmental conditions."

Timely detection of precancerous lesions for patients with chronic HBV infection is critical in preventing worse consequences. The purpose of this study is to reveal the key serum metabolic biomarkers that can be applied to the early recognition of HCC in patients with HBV-associated cirrhosis.\n\nMETHODS: Blood samples from patients with LC, HCC, and healthy subjects were collected, and endogenous metabolites in serum were detected by ultra high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS). Differential metabolites (DM) were screened, and metabolic pathways and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes signals involved in DM were analyzed.\n\nRESULTS: Metabolomics results revealed that patients with LC and HCC had significantly different metabolic characteristics. Patients with LC and HCC shared 22 biomarkers, LC had six different biomarkers, and HCC had 10 different biomarkers. The expressions of these metabolites all showed significant differences between groups. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the differential biomarkers of LC were primarily involved in the regulation of phospholipid biosynthesis, while the differential biomarkers of HCC were mainly involved in the regulation of endogenous androgen signaling, mitochondrial fatty acid metabolism, and purine metabolism signaling. The common biomarkers are enriched in bile acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism.\n\nCONCLUSION: We clarified the blood metabolism characteristics of LC and HCC. These findings provided potential endogenous metabolic indicators for early recognition of HBV-chronically infected cirrhotic patients who may progress to HCC."

While conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has provided valuable insights into these changes, such as the formation of crystalloid-ER and ER whorls, obtaining comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) information on these large structures within their cellular context has remained a challenge. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces an innovative application of dual-axis scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography to investigate ER morphology under stress conditions in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells overexpressing the cation channel polycystin-2 (PC-2). Benefitting from high-resolution, increased depth-of-focus, and reduced aberrations, STEM tomography enabled the detailed 3D reconstruction of large cellular subvolumes, providing unprecedented views of stress-induced ER structures. Our findings reveal distinct ultrastructural details of both crystalloid-ER and ER whorls. Crystalloid-ER exhibited a tubular architecture with potential interconnectedness, while ER whorls displayed a lamellar organisation and distinct membrane curvature. We observed the co-occurrence of these distinct smooth ER (sER) morphotypes within the same cell, yet they remained spatially separated, suggesting potential functional specialisation. Furthermore, we identified direct membrane contacts in mixed morphotypes, hinting at a shared origin or dynamic relationship between these structures. The study also elucidated the interactions of these organised smooth ER (OSER) structures with other organelles, such as mitochondria (MAM sites) and vesicles. In summary, the presented ultra-structural insights have a significant impact on our understanding of stress-related ER morphology changes. The ability to visualise the intricate 3D architecture and spatial relationships of these structures provides novel perspectives on the ER's adaptive responses to stress, including potential roles in lipid and protein biosynthesis and intracellular communication. These findings underscore the power of dual-axis STEM tomography for elucidating complex organellar organisation and dynamics in their native cellular context."

Thus, the main purpose of this study is to investigate the necessity of steaming processing of YHS before using it in clinical via mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). During 1-10 min, changes in volatile components (VOCs) were measured by headspace gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and components of YHS were observed via high-performance liquid analysis (HPLC) in steaming processing to analyze the optimum steaming time. As well as investigating the mechanism of YHS for CAG by using network pharmacology. Overall, berberine, coptisine, columbamine, jatrorrhizine, and magnoflorine were markedly increased after steaming of YHS that the best time of 5-7 min. The VOCs were significantly changed, which mainly include 2-phenylacetaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal, and alpha-terpinolene. Furthermore, the compound-target-disease networks and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were performed, which involve PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathway subsequently. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics were performed; the sanguinarine, berberine, and saulatine were key components to regulate HSP90AB1 and MAPK3 of YHS for CAG."

Inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism (IECMs) are inherited genetic defects resulting in improper transport, modification, or utilization of cobalamin and include inherited methylmalonic acidurias, a group of IECMs most frequently caused by a defect in the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme. Here, we performed genome-scale modeling of IECMs to gain insight into their metabolic perturbations. First, we simulated deficiencies in 11 IECM-related genes and demonstrated that they cluster based on impaired metabolic pathways. Next, we leveraged RNA sequencing data from fibroblasts of 202 individuals with methylmalonic aciduria and 19 unaffected controls to construct and interrogate personalized metabolic models. Finally, we analyzed fluxes differing between patients depending on reported symptom presentation. Our findings reveal that (i) metabolic pathways including fatty acid metabolism and heme biosynthesis have reduced flux in IECMs, (ii) in personalized simulations, succinate and fumarate production and heme biosynthesis are impaired, especially in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency, (iii) one-carbon metabolism reactions such as serine hydroxymethyltransferase and folylglutamate synthase have reduced flux in all individuals with methylmalonic aciduria, and (iv) specific metabolic pathways are up- or down-regulated according to symptoms, including failure to thrive and hematological abnormalities, and treatments, such as antibiotics and protein restriction. Overall, our study delineates metabolic pathways perturbed in IECMs. In future applications, our modeling framework could be applied to other rare genetic diseases or used to predict personalized therapeutic or dietary interventions."

It typically presents with cardiomyopathy or hepatic failure in early childhood; however, it may rarely present in adulthood with the neuromyopathic form.\n\nMETHODS: We describe a patient with MTPD with isolated neuropathy mimicking Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) as the first and only presenting symptom. Clinical and electrophysiological examinations were conducted, including nerve conduction studies, needle electromyography, muscle and nerve biopsies. The diagnosis was confirmed with genetic testing and enzymatic analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts.\n\nRESULTS: We report a 40-year-old man diagnosed with axonal CMT2 in childhood. He had pes cavus and hammer toes, mild distal lower limb weakness, and loss of vibration sense with areflexia. He later developed fatigability, improved exercise tolerance with alcohol and an episode of chest infection causing neurological decompensation without evidence of rhabdomyolysis. Neurophysiology showed non-length-dependent axonal sensorimotor neuropathy without myopathic features. Genetic testing confirmed that he was compound heterozygous for two HADHA variants, one of them novel, and enzymatic analysis of cultured skin fibroblasts confirmed MTPD.\n\nINTERPRETATION: We report a very rare isolated neuropathic phenotype of MTPD and confirm the pathogenicity of the novel variant c.1003G>A, p.(Glu335Lys). This case also highlights the need for HADHA and HADHB to be included in neuropathy gene panels as MTPD may present as CMT. Given that dietary management may prevent some complications of MTPD, achieving a diagnosis early is important."

The scaffolds were made using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS), incorporating different amounts of atorvastatin and silybin. Physicochemical characterization included SEM, FTIR, porosity, compressive strength, degradation rate, contact angle, and drug release profile. In vitro, evaluations involved checking MG63 cell viability, hemocompatibility, and cytotoxicity. In vivo, performance was assessed in a rat model of critical-size calvarial defects using micro-CT, histology, and quantitative real-time PCR to measure key gene expression related to bone formation. The optimized scaffold (PCL/Gel with 24 μg/mL silybin and 19.75 μg/mL atorvastatin) showed high porosity (80 %), suitable mechanical strength (8.02 ± 0.95 MPa), and sustained drug release (atorvastatin: 68 % at 288 h; silybin: 48 % at 576 h).

G-protein-coupled receptor 120 (GPR120), a lipid sensor regulating insulin sensitivity and inflammation, has gained attention as a promising target.\n\nAREAS COVERED: This review evaluates 25 patents and peer-reviewed studies (2020-2025) on GPR120 agonists. It highlights potent thiophene derivatives (EC₅₀ < 50 nM), sulfonamides, and stable fatty acid mimetics. Special attention is given to β-arrestin-biased agonists that improve glucose control (25% AUC reduction), improve insulin sensitivity (30% glucose drop), and reduce inflammation (40% TNFα inhibition). These compounds enhance GLP-1 secretion (a 2-fold increase), offering triple therapeutic benefits for diabetes. Sources were identified through a structured search of recent scientific literature and databases.\n\nEXPERT OPINION: GPR120 agonists, particularly β-arrestin-biased ligands, hold significant potential for T2DM treatment by modulating glucose homeostasis and inflammation. However, challenges like receptor desensitization and translational barriers such as species-specific receptor expression, off-target activity, and suboptimal pharmacokinetics must be addressed. Future research should optimize drug design to enhance efficacy and safety, paving the way for novel metabolic disorder therapies."

Prior studies yielded heterogeneous results, ranging from decreased to increased intestinal permeability in AN. This study aimed to assess intestinal permeability in adolescent patients with AN by comparing serum markers Zonulin, Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and intestinal Fatty acid-binding protein (iFABP) with healthy controls (HC) over time.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study on 60 female adolescent patients with AN and 36 age-matched HC. Blood samples were collected at admission to inpatient treatment, at discharge, and at a one-year follow-up. Zonulin, LBP, iFABP and inflammation marker Interleukin 6 levels were measured alongside clinical parameters. Linear mixed models were applied to assess group differences and longitudinal changes. Pearson correlations were used to explore clinical associations.\n\nRESULTS: Zonulin levels were significantly decreased in the AN group at admission and again at the follow-up compared to HC. LBP levels were consistently reduced in AN across all three time points. These alterations thus persisted despite weight recovery. No significant differences were observed in iFABP levels between the groups or over time. Zonulin and LBP positively correlated with Interleukin 6, linking gut permeability to inflammatory processes.\n\nCONCLUSION: Decreased Zonulin and LBP levels suggest reduced paracellular intestinal permeability in adolescent AN while transcellular permeability (iFABP) appears to be rather unaffected. The persistence of these alterations despite weight recovery suggests that reduced intestinal permeability may be a trait rather than a state marker in AN. Our findings challenge the concept of a \"leaky gut\" in adolescent AN.This highlights the need for further research on the intestinal barrier in AN, while also integrating the role of nutritional intake, gut microbiome interaction and immune reactions, to support the development of gut-targeted therapies."

The intensity of the inflammatory response appears as the principal driver of the changes involved in outcome, and especially those affecting protein metabolism and muscle catabolism, and resistance to nutrition. The present exploratory study aims to clarify the role of the different cytokines in amino acid metabolism.\n\nMETHODS: In this post-hoc analysis of the previously published observational study, including 51 critically ill patients and 49 healthy controls aiming at identifying patient changes in amino acid metabolism, we assessed the association between a panel of cytokines and blood levels of amino acids (AA) and their turnover. The subjects were matched for age, sex, and BMI. The study was conducted in postabsorptive state. Blood analysis included cytokines (determined by Luminex), C-reactive protein (CRP or hsCRP), and AA.\n\nPROTOCOL: 8 mL solution containing 18 stable AA tracers administered as a pulse to calculate amino acid whole body production (WBP). WBP was calculated from fitted decay curves. We measured amino acid enrichments and concentrations by LC-MS/MS and derived statistics using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) t and stepwise regression. Data as means [95%CI].\n\nRESULTS: The study included 51 critically ill patients (age 63 yrs [58, 68], APACHEII 21.6 [20, 24]) and 49 matched healthy controls (age 57 yrs [52, 61]). While anthropometric characteristics were similar between critically ill patients and healthy adults, phase angle was lower (3.9 [3.5, 4.2] vs 6.0 [5.6, 6.3], p < 0.001), most AA blood levels were lower, while most cytokine levels were significantly higher. IL-6 and CRP were strongly associated (p < 0.001). IL-6 was the cytokine with the strongest association with the AA blood levels and WBP alterations in patients. Three patterns of changes in the plasma cytokine concentrations were observed. Of the 37 cytokines measured, 12 were higher in ICU patients, 5 were lower, and the rest were similar.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The present study shows a comprehensive picture of inflammation and simultaneous alterations of AA metabolism. The levels of IL-6 and CRP may become a good indicator of the metabolic capacity to respond positively to nutrition therapy.\n\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY: Data are from the baseline measurements of study NCT02770092 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02770092) and NCT03628365 (URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03628365)."

However, existing evidence lacks consistent evaluation across varying follow-up durations, while the specific factors influencing their safety and effectiveness remain undetermined. This study aims to evaluate the quality of evidence regarding the safety, efficacy, and impact factors of applying the resorbable bio-inductive collagen implant clinically to repair rotator cuff injuries.\n\nMETHODS: The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022367522). A systematic literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library (from inception to October 2024) for clinical studies on bio-inductive collagen implants for rotator cuff repair. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality (using RoB1 for RCTs, NOS for cohort studies and JBI critical appraisal tools for case series). Primary outcomes included postoperative tendon thickness, shoulder function scores (ASES/Constant), and re-tear rates. Data were analyzed using random/fixed-effects models to calculate mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs, with subgroup analyses for tear type, patient age, and postoperative mobilization time. Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 17.0.\n\nRESULTS: Seventeen studies were included. The meta-analysis results showed that postoperative tendon thickness of the patients increased statistically compared with the baseline, at 3 months (MD = 2.22; 95% CI: 1.61, 2.83; p < 0.001), 6 months (MD = 2.30; 95% CI: 1.44, 3.16; p < 0.001), 12 months (MD = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.58, 2.72; p < 0.001), and 24 months (MD = 1.05; 95% CI: 0.02, 2.08; p = 0.045).

The ASES score and Constant score of the patients were significantly higher than the baseline at 6 months (ASES: MD = 35.90; 95% CI: 32.97, 38.83; p < 0.001), 12 months (ASES: MD = 40.83; 95% CI: 37.56, 44.10; p < 0.001; Constant: MD = 28.59; 95% CI: 21.44, 35.74; p < 0.001), and 24 months (ASES: MD = 39.80; 95% CI: 31.32, 48.27; p < 0.001; Constant: MD = 32.84; 95% CI: 28.72, 36.97; p < 0.001).\n\nCONCLUSION: The bio-inductive collagen implant is effective and safe for healing rotator cuff injuries. Patient age may be an important moderator affecting its efficacy. The impact of tear size and postoperative activities on efficacy needs to be further explored through in-depth clinical studies."

E1 and E2 proteins of HCV can produce neutralizing antibodies and are often used to screen potential epitopes. In this study, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293F) cells were used to generate highly active HCV E1 and E2 proteins, which were then used as antigen for producing mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Novel B cell epitopes of E1 and E2 were disclosed using monoclonal antibodies for the first time. Based on the epitopes, three multi-epitope (MEP) antigens were designed and prepared including non-structural proteins and novel identified B cell epitopes in E1 and E2 in HCV 1b, 2a, 3a, 6a subtypes. Double antigen sandwich enzyme immunoassay was established based on the MEPs to detect HCV serum antibodies, showing potential diagnostic application. This study suggests that B-cell epitopes of E1 and E2 could contribute to the development of diagnostic reagents, provides an important reference value and theoretical support for the optimization of diagnostic reagents for HCV."

Its dual nature, being vital yet potentially toxic, underscores the importance of precise intake. Geographical disparities in soil Se content lead to widespread dietary deficiencies, driving the advancement of Se-fortified foods. Food selenium fortification strategies are implemented through modern techniques, including selenium application to soil or foliage, crop genetic engineering, microorganism-mediated transformation, and direct supplementation of animal feed or processed foods. Selenium compounds ingested through selenium-fortified foods are typically categorized into inorganic and organic types. Organic (e.g., selenoamino acid) and inorganic (e.g., selenate) selenium are absorbed and transformed through amino acid transport pathways and ion transport pathways, respectively, and this distinction leads to differences in their metabolism and toxicity. Excessive selenium is toxic and characterized by nerve damage, hair/nail loss, and gastrointestinal complaints, which can lead to death in severe cases. Organic forms exhibit superior bioavailability, higher nutritional value, and lower toxicological risks. This review comprehensively examines the preparation methods, commonvarities, and the impacts of selenium fortification on these foods. The conversion of various primary dietary selenium compounds in the human body is compared, and the impact of dietary selenium supplementation on human health is evaluated. Additionally, the recommended selenium intake ranges for different age groups specified by various countries and regions are highlighted, with the aim of guiding individuals to scientifically supplement selenium."

Sacubitril/valsartan has been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with heart failure and delay the progression of chronic kidney disease. We aim to perform a comprehensive analysis of current clinical evidence on the use of sacubitril/valsartan in ESRD patients.\n\nMETHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science using keywords such as 'sacubitril/valsartan', 'end-stage renal disease', 'hemodialysis' and 'heart failure'. The search deadline is December 20, 2024. In this review, we discuss the pharmacological mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, and latest clinical evidence of the administration of sacubitril/valsartan in ESRD patients with heart failure.\n\nRESULTS: Sacubitril/valsartan contains sacubitril and valsartan that can regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and natriuretic peptides simultaneously. For ESRD patients with heart failure, particularly those with reduced ejection fraction, sacubitril/valsartan demonstrated potential benefits including improved ventricular remodeling, enhanced left ventricular ejection fraction, and reduced mortality and heart failure re-hospitalization rates, while maintaining a favorable safety profile with no significant increased risk of hyperkalemia or hypotension. This review further discusses current challenges and future directions, including health economic evaluations and adverse event management strategies, to optimize clinical decision-making for the use of sacubitril/valsartan in this high-risk population.\n\nCONCLUSION: Sacubitril/valsartan may benefit ESRD patients with heart failure by improving ventricular remodeling and cardiac function while reducing mortality and hospitalization risks, without major safety concerns.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of αSAA for detecting αSyn in CSF for diagnosing dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) in a clinical cohort of cognitively impaired individuals. We explored how the coexistence of Alzheimer disease (AD) and αSyn pathology influences biomarker levels and clinical profiles. This study contributes to the understanding of αSAA diagnostic performance for DLB and for detecting αSyn copathology in AD in a real-world memory clinic cohort, using both clinical and biomarker-based classifications.\n\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective, single-center, cross-sectional observational cohort study of cognitively impaired individuals who attended a tertiary memory clinic in Spain between 2009 and 2024. Participants had neurodegenerative and non-neurodegenerative cognitive decline. αSAA was performed on CSF samples collected at first evaluation. The diagnostic performance of the assay for DLB and associations between AD/αSyn copathology, clinical features, and fluid biomarkers (phosphorylated-tau217 [p-tau217], glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were analyzed in AD and DLB participants. Diagnostic performance of the test was assessed using standard contingency tables and interactions between biomarkers and clinical features with age, sex, and APOE-adjusted analysis of covariance.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 640 participants were included (mean age 67.8 years, 48% female) with clinical diagnoses of AD (n = 337), DLB (n = 92), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (n = 79), non-neurodegenerative cognitive impairment (n = 100), and cognitively unimpaired controls (n = 32). αSAA exhibited a 95.7% sensitivity (95% CI 91.6%-99.8%), 93.2% specificity (95% CI 90.4%-96.0%), and a 93.6% overall diagnostic accuracy for DLB. Among patients with AD, 9.5% were αSAA positive; these individuals more often had core DLB features at presentation, higher APOE ε4 frequency, and elevated plasma p-tau217. Fifty percent of DLB patients showed AD copathology, associated with lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores, higher APOE ε4 prevalence, and higher CSF and plasma NfL. αSAA+ AD subjects had significantly higher p-tau217 and CSF p-tau181 than DLB AD+ patients.\n\nDISCUSSION: αSAA demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for DLB, supporting its clinical utility. AD-DLB copathology is associated with distinct cognitive and biomarker profiles, with varying levels of pathology shaping the clinical phenotype (AD- or DLB-predominant). These findings highlight the need for tailored diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

Epigenetic clocks, which estimate biological age based on DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns, have been proposed as potential biomarkers of chronic stress and its impact on biological aging and health. However, their role in mediating the relationship between work-related stress, physiological stress markers, and burnout remains unclear.\n\nMETHODS: Here, we analyzed DNAm data from 296 employed individuals (n\n\nRESULTS: As expected, work-related stress at baseline significantly predicted burnout (β = .47, p < .001) and depressive symptoms (β = .32, p < .001) at follow-up.

While work-related stress significantly predicts burnout and depressive symptoms, its association does not appear to be driven by epigenetic aging pathways in a low to moderately burdened population.

However, when the features of drug and target are applied to biological networks, there is a lack of capturing the relational features of drug-target interactions. And the corresponding multimodal models mainly depend on shallow fusion strategies, which results in suboptimal performance when trying to capture complex interaction relationships. Therefore, this study proposes a novel framework named KG-MACNF. This framework utilizes knowledge graph embedding (KGE) techniques to capture multi-level relational features of entities in large-scale biological networks. Simultaneously, our innovative PoolGAT network, along with CTD descriptors, is employed to extract drug structural features and protein sequence information. Finally, by employing our innovative nonlinear-driven cross-modal attention fusion network, the framework efficiently integrates these multimodal data and generates the final DTI prediction results. Experiments on two publicly available datasets, Yamanishi_08's and BioKG, demonstrate the substantial advantages of KG-MACNF in DTI prediction. KG-MACNF demonstrates robust stability, especially under imbalanced data conditions. This study successfully overcomes the bottlenecks of prior models in utilizing modality information and feature complementarity, providing a more accurate tool for drug discovery and DTI prediction."

Standard of care is limited to protein restriction and supportive care during metabolic decompensation. Severe cases require liver/kidney transplantation, and there is a clear need for better therapy. Here, we investigated the effects of a small molecule branched-chain amino acid transaminase (BCAT) inhibitor in human MMA hepatocytes and an MMA mouse model. Mitochondrial BCAT is the first step in BCAA catabolism, and reduction of flux through an early enzymatic step is successfully used in other amino acid metabolic disorders. Metabolic flux analyses confirmed robust BCAT inhibition, with reduction of labeling of proximal and distal BCAA-derived metabolites in MMA hepatocytes. In vivo experiments verified the BCAT inhibition, but total levels of distal BCAA catabolite disease markers and clinical symptoms were not normalized, indicating contributions of substrates other than BCAA to these distal metabolite pools. Our study demonstrates the importance of understanding the underlying pathology of metabolic disorders for identification of therapeutic targets and the use of multiple, complementary models to evaluate them."

Early detection and proactive management of cardiac dysfunction are essential for optimizing outcomes. Despite significant advances and decades of research, a definitive cure for DMD remains elusive.

However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of EV populations and the low abundance of miRNAs in early stage cancer pose a challenge in the sensitive detection of miRNAs in tumor-cell-derived EV (TEV). Herein, we present a one-pot strategy named miR-nSTEV for specific recognition and in situ miRNA profiling of TEV at the single-particle level for precise prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. Utilizing dual-surface protein recognition (CD63 and EpCAM) and orthogonal DNA barcoding-based fusion between the identified TEV and DNA-tagged liposome encapsulating variant miRNA probes (Tag-Lipo probes), our approach enables selective isolation and precise miRNA analysis of individual TEVs by nanoflow cytometry (nFCM). By integrating dual-protein sorting, DNA-directed fusion, and nFCM detection into one platform, miR-nSTEV effectively eliminates interference from free nucleic acids and RNases, significantly enhancing the detection fidelity. As a proof of concept, we profiled six PCa-associated miRNAs (miR-153, miR-183, miR-18A, miR-181, miR-429, and miR-940) in both cell culture medium and clinical plasma samples. The miR-nSTEV assay demonstrated superior diagnostic performance, achieving 100% accuracy in distinguishing PCa patients from healthy donors (HD), outperforming conventional RT-qPCR while simplifying the workflow. Overall, miR-nSTEV offers a robust, sensitive, and noninvasive tool for real-time TEV miRNA analysis, paving the way for early detection and precision diagnostics in PCa patients."

Furthermore, the delivery of ARV-825 using NPs achieves synergistic anti-tumor effects with temozolomide (TMZ) in GBM cells. These findings validate nanovehicles as a strategic solution for PROTAC limitations and provide a blueprint for translating catalytic degradation into clinically viable therapies against GBM."

    "text": "OBJECTIVE: TP53 mutations, including missense and inactivating (frameshift, splice site, and nonsense) mutations, occur in approximately 10% of myeloid neoplasms and confer adverse outcomes. Classification of myeloid neoplasms by World Health Organization and International Consensus Classification standards recognizes the importance of early detection of TP53 mutations. p53 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a widely accessible method used to detect mutations; however, previous studies have demonstrated variable accuracy, especially for inactivating TP53 mutations. Recently, sequencing using targeted panels has seen increased use. Although highly accurate, sequencing is resource intensive and not universally available.\n\nMETHODS: Using 134 bone marrow samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia evaluated for TP53 mutation by sequencing, we assessed the concordance of p53 IHC with sequencing as well as the interrater-reliability for IHC intensity and percent positivity.\n\nRESULTS: Consistent with previous studies, we found that p53 IHC was strongly specific and modestly sensitive for missense mutations and that overall performance improved with dedicated hematopathology training. We also found that IHC performed poorly for inactivating mutations and was even variable between cases harboring identical amino acid changes. Low predicted transcriptional activity of p53 missense proteins correlated with a mutant pattern of IHC staining. The status of the second allele and variant allele frequency also affected the accuracy of p53 IHC as a surrogate for TP53 allele status.\n\nCONCLUSION: Cases of acute myeloid leukemia with TP53 mutations predicted to have low transcriptional activity showed reduced overall survival. Our results demonstrate limited practical utility of p53 IHC for accurate evaluation of TP53 mutation status because of multifactorial confounders."

This study investigates survivin expression alongside autophagy markers ATG7 and LC3B in seven solid tumor types in Indian patient samples. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on 48 cancer tissue samples (breast n = 7, buccal n = 6, cervical n = 5, colon n = 8, renal n = 6, liver n = 10, thyroid n = 6) and adjacent normal tissues (n = 9) using anti-human antibodies against survivin, ATG7, and LC3B. Expression levels were semi-quantitatively scored (0-3 +) and statistically analyzed. Survivin demonstrated significant overexpression in cancer tissues compared to normal tissues across all tumor types (p ≤ 0.05-0.0001). Moreover, a statistically significant inverse correlation was observed between survivin and autophagy marker (ATG7/LC3B) expression in 85% of examined samples. Breast, buccal, liver, and kidney cancers showed strong-to-moderate survivin expression in > 50% of cases, while thyroid cancers exhibited predominantly weak survivin expression with strong autophagy marker expression. These findings demonstrate consistent survivin overexpression with concomitant autophagy suppression in Indian cancer patients. The inverse relationship between survivin and autophagy marker expression suggests survivin inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to activate autophagic cell death, particularly in breast, buccal, liver, and kidney cancers with high survivin expression. Future large-scale validation studies and mechanistic investigations are warranted to translate these findings into personalized survivin-targeted therapeutic strategies. This study contributes to a better understanding of survivin and its relation to autophagy in various solid tumors, paving the way for novel therapeutics for cancer."

Traditionally used as a Rasayana or rejuvenator, this potent adaptogen helps the body manage stress and enhance vitality. This review synthesises extensive evidence for its multifaceted anti-aging capabilities, which target key hallmarks of the aging process. The mechanisms underpinning its effects include enhancing telomerase activity to support cellular longevity, combating systemic oxidative stress, and powerfully countering inflammaging by modulating immune responses and lowering inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein. Robust clinical evidence demonstrates its efficacy in improving crucial physiological parameters, including significant gains in muscle strength and size, enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness, hormonal balance, skin health, and improved sleep quality in older adults. Furthermore, trials have consistently shown its ability to improve cognitive function, including memory and information-processing speed, particularly in adults with mild cognitive impairment. Promising preclinical data also highlight its neuroprotective potential in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Here, we review the current evidence supports Ashwagandha's therapeutic potential in extending healthspan and enhancing quality of life. Large-scale, long-term clinical trials using standardized extracts are essential to fully confirm its role in healthy aging within the global population."

However, there is limited understanding of clinicians' views on their benefits and how to effectively integrate them into daily clinical practice.\n\nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore healthcare professionals' views on using respiratory tract infection tests to safely reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections in primary care based on their experience in routine practice.\n\nDESIGN: A qualitative study design was employed. Two focus group discussions were conducted.\n\nSETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: These focus group discussions were conducted in February 2025, involving 18 Spanish primary care professionals, both experts and non-experts in rational antibiotic use and antimicrobial resistance. Data were audio-recorded or video-recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically.\n\nRESULTS: Participants agreed that respiratory tract infection tests help optimise antibiotic prescriptions, reduce uncertainty, ensure the appropriate consumption of resources and guide treatment based on aetiology. While most professionals view microbiological tests and C-reactive protein testing as complementary, non-experts preferred microbiological tests. Professionals considered that patients value knowing the aetiology over the prognosis, supporting shared decision-making and addressing patients' demands more effectively. Concerns remain about using these tests as stand-alone tools and the medicalisation of self-limiting conditions. Other barriers mentioned included the high cost and time-consuming nature, the need for better professional training and the challenge of managing the increased workload associated with their use.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This study highlights how clinicians perceive respiratory tract infection tests to aid prescribing decisions amid uncertainty. Both positive and negative views were reported. Participants agreed that these tests optimise antibiotic prescriptions and guide treatment, but there are still important barriers to their implementation."

The primary efficacy endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) by an independent review (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1, RECIST v1.1), while the primary safety endpoint was frequency and severity of adverse events. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).\n\nRESULTS: Overall, 198 anti-programmed cell death protein-1 therapy-naïve patients with confirmed HPV16-positive recurrent/metastatic oropharyngeal cancer were randomized to receive cemiplimab plus peltopepimut-S (n=100) or placebo (n=99). The trial did not meet its primary objective (ORR, 25.3% in peltopepimut-S arm vs 22.9% in placebo arm; p=0.735). The median OS (mOS) and PFS in the placebo arm were unexpectedly longer than in the peltopepimut-S arm (26.9 vs 15.8 months) and (20.3 vs 5.5 months), respectively. In predefined exploratory analyses this was associated with an excess death rate from progressive disease in patients with pre-treatment programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) <20. In contrast, patients with CPS ≥20 had a higher ORR of 51.7% (95% CI, 32.5% to 70.6%) vs 25.8% (95% CI, 11.9% to 44.6%) and a longer mOS in the peltopepimut-S arm (34.8 vs 28.8 months) compared with the placebo arm, respectively. If patients had received all three vaccine or placebo doses, the ORR in patients with CPS ≥20 was 70.0% (95% CI, 45.7% to 88.1%) vs 29.2% (95% CI, 12.6% to 51.1%) in the peltopepimut-S arm and placebo arms, respectively, associated with mOS not reached (after 42 months) versus 23.3 months. The addition of peltopepimut-S to cemiplimab did not increase cemiplimab's toxicity.\n\nCONCLUSION: Adding peltopepimut-S to cemiplimab did not improve ORR and worsened mOS in the primary analysis. Divergent outcomes were seen in patients with pretreatment PD-L1 CPS <20 (worse ORR and mOS compared with placebo) and CPS ≥20 (higher ORR and longer mOS compared with placebo) values. Future drug development is justifiable in the CPS ≥20 patient population.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03669718."

This study aimed to assess the relationship between lipid profile levels, SIRT1 expression, and RNA-34a-5P in the regulation of blood lipid levels among severely obese individuals with renal diseases. Conducted over six months in three specialized hospitals, the study included 100 participants divided into two groups: 50 obese individuals with renal diseases and 50 obese controls without renal problems. Ethical standards, including confidentiality and informed consent, were strictly observed. Biochemical assessments included measurements of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, creatinine, GFR, SIRT1 protein (via Western blotting), and RNA-34a-5P expression (via qPCR). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v26 and Pearson's correlation. The results revealed a negative association between RNA-34a-5P expression and total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, and SIRT1 expression, while a positive but non-significant association was found with HDL and GFR. Notably, SIRT1 expression was significantly downregulated in the patient group compared to controls. These findings provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 expression is markedly reduced in extremely obese individuals with renal diseases, suggesting a potential molecular link between SIRT1, lipid metabolism, and renal dysfunction in severe obesity."

In injuries with critical nerve gaps, PN regeneration requires tissue scaffolds with appropriate physiological properties that promote cell growth and functions. Hydrogel scaffolds represent a promising platform for engineering soft tissue constructs that meet key physiological requirements. Nonetheless, ongoing innovation remains essential, as current designs continue to fall short of replicating the functional performance of autografts in bridging critical-sized nerve defects. In this study, gelatin methacrylate (gelMA)-based hydrogels are evaluated to fully characterize their pore structure, compressive stiffness, viscoelasticity, and 3D bioprintability. Hyaluronic acid (HA) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are explored as gelMA additives to modify viscoelastic and electrically conductive properties, respectively. Finally, Schwann cell (SC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) growth and functions are quantified to assess the biocompatibility of the hydrogel composites as materials for nerve scaffold fabrication. It was found that the microstructure and mechanical properties of gelMA-based hydrogels can be precisely controlled by modifying the concentrations of each component. The addition of HA led to altered viscoelastic properties of the cured structures and SWCNTs increased electrical conductivity, with both additives maintaining cytocompatibility while influencing the protein expression of both SCs and HUVECs. These composite hydrogels have potential in PNI regeneration applications."

Using automatic fiber tractography, glioma-tract relationships were categorized into 3 types: displacement, infiltration, and disruption. Double immunohistochemical staining for isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and myelin basic protein was performed on neuronavigation-guided tissue samples to validate the imaging-based classifications. The clinical implications of these classifications on the extent of tumor resection, postoperative motor function, and survival outcomes were evaluated.\n\nRESULTS: Among the patients, 35 (9.7%) were categorized as displacement type, 283 (78.6%) as infiltration type, and 42 (11.7%) as disruption type. Disruption-type tracts were predominantly associated with IDH wild-type gliomas (87.2%), significantly higher than infiltration (28.5%) and displacement types (23.5%) (P < .001). Displacement and infiltration types were more common in IDH-mutant gliomas (P < .001). Displacement-type tracts were significantly associated with higher rates of gross tumor resection compared to infiltration types (P = .015). In corticospinal tract involved cases, displacement-type tumors demonstrated no significant postoperative motor strength changes, whereas infiltration (P < .001) and disruption types (P = .013) were highly associated with postoperative motor deficits. Histological results aligned with dMRI-based classifications.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: This dMRI-based classification of glioma-tract interactions is significantly associated with tumor pathology, resection outcomes, functional prognosis, and survival, providing a valuable tool for personalized and precise surgical planning."

The concentrations of presepsin, PCT and CRP were significantly elevated 72 h before onset compared to those in the control group. Only the concentration of presepsin at FN onset was significantly higher than 72 h before FN onset.

    "text": "Proteins are an important class of therapeutics for combatting a wide variety of diseases. The increasing demand for convenient, patient-centric treatment options has propelled the development of subcutaneously delivered protein therapies and increased the interest in novel formulations and delivery methods. However, subcutaneous delivery of protein therapeutics remains a challenge due to the high protein concentrations ( >100 mg/mL) required to circumvent lower bioavailability and the smaller injection volumes required to enable the use of mature and cost-effective devices, such as standard prefilled syringes and autoinjectors. At high concentrations, protein solutions exhibit elevated viscosity, which poses injectability and manufacturing challenges. Here, we review the state of the art in experimental and computationally predictive formulation development approaches for viscosity mitigation of high-concentration protein solution therapeutics, and we suggest new directions for expanding the utility of these approaches beyond traditional monoclonal antibodies. Innovative approaches should leverage and combine advances in both experimental and computational methods, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, to rapidly identify formulation compositions for viscosity reduction, and subsequently facilitate the development of patient-centric biotherapeutics."

Briefly, T cells are genetically modified to express CAR protein directly in the body by delivery of vectors. With the continuous optimization of gene delivery systems, gene editing technologies and CAR structures, advancements in in vivo CAR-T therapies have notably enhanced safety, effectiveness, and application in clinical settings. Here, we review the key platforms of in vivo gene delivery and the progress of in vivo CAR-T cell therapy for cancers. We discuss the challenges of in vivo CAR-T cell therapy, such as safety issues of gene delivery, the persistence and function of CAR-T cell, and the immunosuppressive microenvironment in solid tumors."

Clinical evidence suggests that ZIKV could break through the blood-brain, blood-placenta, and blood-testis barriers, leading to severe outcomes such as congenital malformations in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Currently, there are no specific treatments for ZIKV infection. To address the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue virus (DENV) infection induced by ZIKV vaccination, we designed two modified prM-E RNAs (ZA and ZB) with specific mutations either shielding or disrupting the conserved fusion-loop epitope in the E protein. Then, we chose the mRNA-LNP vaccine platform to evaluate the safety and efficacy. After prime-boost immunization, ZA vaccine could induce high levels of T cells secreting IFN-γ and exhibit limited neutralizing ability against Asian-lineage and African-lineage ZIKV. After ZIKV challenge, ZA vaccine could provide complete protection in immunocompromised AG129 mice at low levels of neutralizing antibodies, preventing viral dissemination to the brain, uterus, and testes. Importantly, the ZA vaccine also reduced the ADE effect of DENV infection. Although ZB vaccine exhibited good immunogenicity, it could not achieve complete viral clearance in AG29 mice. Our findings suggested that the ZA vaccine could prevent both lethal ZIKV infection and DENV ADE induced by infection or vaccination."

    "text": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Most patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) suffer from fatigue, which can be defined as a subjective lack of energy and difficulty in initiating or sustaining voluntary activities. This is conceptually different from muscle weakness or muscle fatigability. Fatigue is one of the most reported symptoms in MG and has been hypothesized to be an innate mechanism to minimize muscle activity in order to protect muscles from (further) damage. The exact pathophysiology of fatigue remains unclear, and it is very likely a multifactorial phenomenon. The aim of this study was to provide a better understanding on the pathophysiology of fatigue in MG.\n\nMETHODS: We analyzed 38 serum biomarkers including various cytokines and myokines in a cohort of 116 anti-acetylcholine receptor-positive patients with MG. A multivariate linear regression analysis for each biomarker was performed in search for a correlation with fatigue. The following preselected covariates were included in the primary analysis: sex, age, disease severity, depression and anxiety scores, nonsteroid immune suppressive medication, and cumulative prednisone dosage in the past 6 months.\n\nRESULTS: Severe fatigue was present in 64% of patients. Results show a robust correlation between fatigue and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the primary analysis. This correlation persisted when additionally adjusting for BMI, strenuous physical activities, and hemoglobulin levels.\n\nDISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that chronic low-grade inflammation, mediated by CRP, contributes to the pathogenesis of fatigue in MG. This aligns with the hypothesis that local peripheral inflammatory processes induce systemic inflammatory cascades responsible for fatigue."

Immunotherapy (IT) leads to the cessation of seizures in most patients, yet some develop AIE-associated epilepsy (AEAE) and persistent cognitive deficits. The aim of this large multicentric retrospective observational cohort study was to assess long-term outcomes of patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis regarding seizures and AEAE and to identify associated factors.\n\nMETHODS: We included patients with anti-LGI1 encephalitis from 3 national referral centers/consortia meeting the following inclusion criteria: (I) definite LGI1 limbic encephalitis (Graus criteria); (II) occurrence of seizures; and (III) follow-up period ≥24 months. We aimed to (1) determine the risk of seizure recurrence (ROSR) on remission, (2) investigate clinical and paraclinical biomarkers for an effect on time to seizure remission using Cox proportional hazard modeling (n = 188), and (3) assess the risk of AEAE and determine associated factors (n = 236).\n\nRESULTS: AEAE was observed in 5.9% (16/271) of the full cohort. Both AEAE (16/16 vs 129/215,\n\nDISCUSSION: In conclusion, our results demonstrate that AEAE in anti-LGI1 encephalitis is rare and suggest that the diagnosis of epilepsy is inappropriate in patients reaching seizure remission because of a relatively low ROSR. Accordingly, on seizure remission, the diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizures would be appropriate. Moreover, we validate and quantify the importance of IT for seizure remission and identify biomarkers associated with lower rates of seizure remission. Late remission of seizures and AEAE were associated with persistent cognitive impairment."

There were no differences in basic indicators such as gender, age distribution and body mass index between the two groups. RA diagnosis followed American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 or ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 criteria. Exclusion criteria included major organ dysfunction, endocrine disease, infection or long-term hormone or psychotropic drug use.\n\nPRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes included total skeletal muscle mass, fat mass, FMR measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis and bone mineral density measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Secondary outcomes included RA disease activity scores (clinical disease activity index (CDAI), simplified disease activity index, disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28)) and glucocorticoid use. Logistic regression and four additional machine learning algorithms were used to build predictive models for OP.\n\nRESULTS: The RA group (age, 58.00; duration, 8.00; DAS28, 5.03; rheumatoid factor, 104.75; C-reactive protein, 25.65; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), 59.00) exhibited reduced total skeletal muscle mass (19.49 vs 25.38, p<0.001), hip bone mineral density (0.90 vs 1.15, p<0.001) and L1-4 bone mineral density (0.86 vs 1.08, p<0.001), alongside increased total fat mass (18.33 vs 16.37, p=0.020) and FMR (0.98 vs 0.68, p<0.001). Total fat mass was positively correlated with simplified and CDAI (p<0.001). Total skeletal muscle mass was negatively correlated with ESR (p=0.001) and positively correlated with both L1-4 and hip bone mineral density (p<0.001). FMR showed a positive correlation with clinical disease activity index (p<0.001). There were significant differences in total fat mass and FMR among RA patients with varying disease activity levels (p<0.001). RA patients with concomitant OP or using glucocorticoids had a higher total fat mass and FMR than their respective control groups, with only total skeletal muscle mass levels being lower (p<0.01). We developed predictive models using multiple machine learning algorithms, which identified that both age and FMR were key factors associated with secondary OP in RA patients. Subgroup analysis identified an interaction effect between FMR and gender and restricted cubic spline fitted the dose-response relationship between FMR and OP.\n\nCONCLUSION: FMR may serve as a useful clinical indicator of secondary OP in RA patients. A model based on FMR and associated risk factors can predict the possibility of secondary OP."

For protection from Ebola virus, the main target populations are epidemiologically identified and often include healthcare workers and refugees. These target populations are also routinely offered vaccines for other vaccine-preventable diseases. However, concomitant use of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP with other vaccines is not recommended, given the absence of data regarding its reactogenicity and antigen-specific immunogenicity profile when co-administered. The EbolaCov trial aims to inform whether rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP can be administered concurrent to a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster dose without an unacceptable increase in reactogenicity and/or loss of humoral immunogenicity to Ebola vaccine antigen.\n\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, randomised, single-blinded, vaccine safety and immunogenicity study in healthy adults living in Rwanda. Seventy-two participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to two study groups, the first receiving rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP with a placebo, the second group receiving rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP concurrently with a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 booster dose. The primary outcome measures are quantitative serum anti-glycoprotein (GP) antibody responses, as measured by ELISA, 28 days after vaccination, and frequency and severity of adverse events in the 7 days following vaccination. Secondary outcome measures include day 28 and day 180 serum anti-GP and serum SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike protein-specific geometric mean antibody titres.\n\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Rwanda National Ethics Committee (reference 442/2024) and the University of Birmingham (reference ERN_2661-Jun2024). All participants were required to provide written informed consent in accordance with good clinical practice. Dissemination of results will be through conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.\n\nTRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR202407764378004) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06587503)."

Although therapeutic options are continuously improving, better combination therapies and individualized approaches are still needed. Reticulocalbin-1 (RCN1), located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is associated with aggressiveness and poor prognosis in many solid tumors, but its role in ccRCC has not been analyzed before.\n\nMETHODS: In this study, we performed in-silico transcriptomic data mining to analyze RCN1 expression at mRNA and protein levels using large publicly available databases and conducted the first large-scale cohort study on the impact of RCN1 in ccRCC, including data from 306 patients who underwent tumor resection at the Clinic of Urology, University Hospital Bonn. We examined the correlation of RCN1 expression with clinicopathological parameters and overall survival. Additionally, we analyzed the association of RCN1 expression with CD8 T-lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration. In vitro functional analysis was performed by silencing RCN1 using siRNA in Caki-1 and A498 cell lines to determine its role in tumor cell behavior.\n\nRESULTS: RCN1 is highly expressed in ccRCC at both the mRNA and protein levels in public databases, which was confirmed by our cohort data, where RCN1 was found to be highly and homogenously expressed in 63.7% of ccRCCs. High RCN1 expression was associated with shorter overall survival both at the mRNA (p < 0.001) and protein levels (p = 0.01). Furthermore, high RCN1 expression was correlated with higher tumor grade (p = 0.002), tumor stage (p = 0.036), presence of lymph node metastases (p = 0.004), and distant metastases (p = 0.017). Clusters of macrophages tended to correlate with RCN1 expression (p = 0.051), but no significant correlation was found between RCN1 expression and the amount of CD8 T-lymphocytes. Additionally, silencing RCN1 led to a significant reduction in tumor cell migration and invasion.\n\nCONCLUSION: Our results confirm that RCN1 is highly and homogenously expressed in ccRCC and correlates with poor prognosis and unfavorable clinicopathological parameters. RCN1 could serve as a reliable biomarker for prognosis in ccRCC and shows potential as a target for therapeutic approaches."

Clinical and periodontal evaluations were conducted, and subgingival plaque samples were collected. Metagenomic sequencing and subsequent microbial composition and functional analyses were performed.\n\nRESULTS: Compared to oHCM patients, those with noHCM had higher systolic blood pressure (138.1 ± 18.8 mmHg vs . 124.2 ± 13.8 mmHg, P = 0.007), a larger body circumference (neck circumference: 39.2 ± 4.0 cm vs . 35.1 ± 3.7 cm, P = 0.001; waist circumference: 99.7 ± 10.5 cm vs . 92.2 ± 10.8 cm, P = 0.027; hip circumference: 102.5 ± 5.6 cm vs . 97.5 ± 9.1 cm, P = 0.030), a greater left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (46.6 ± 4.9 mm vs . 43.1 ± 4.9 mm, P = 0.026), and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (64.1 ± 5.7 % vs . 68.5 ± 7.8%, P = 0.048). While overall biodiversity and general microbial composition were similar between the noHCM and oHCM groups, ten taxa displayed significant differences at the genus and species levels, with Porphyromonas gingivalis showing the highest abundance and greater enrichment in noHCM (relative abundance: 7.79535 vs . 4.87697, P = 0.043). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis identified ten distinct pathways, with pathways related to energy and amino acid metabolism being enriched in oHCM patients, and those associated with genetic information processing less abundant in the oHCM group. Metabolic potential analysis revealed ten significantly altered metabolites primarily associated with amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, porphyrin metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversion, and lysine degradation.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The higher abundance of Porphyromonas gingivalis , which is known to impact cardiovascular health, in noHCM patients may partially account for clinical differences between the groups. Pathway enrichment and metabolic potential analyses suggest microbial functional shifts between noHCM and oHCM patients, potentially reflecting inherent metabolic changes in HCM."

    "text": "Cellular senescence, stable cell cycle arrest that can be triggered in normal cells in response to various intrinsic and extrinsic stressors, has been highlighted as one of the most important mechanisms involved in kidney diseases. It not only serves as a fundamental biological process promoting normal organogenesis and successful wound repair but also contributes to organ dysfunction, tissue fibrosis, and the generalized aging phenotype. Moreover, senescent cells exhibit reduced regenerative capacity, which impairs renal function recovery from injuries. Importantly, senescent cells are involved in immune regulation via secreting a diverse array of proinflammatory and profibrotic factors known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) with autocrine, paracrine, and endocrine activities. Thus, eliminating detrimental senescent cells or inhibiting SASP production holds great promise for developing innovative therapeutic strategies for kidney diseases. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the intricate mechanisms and hallmarks of cellular senescence in kidney diseases and emphasize novel therapeutic targets, including epigenetic regulators, G protein-coupled receptors, and lysosome-related proteins. Particularly, we highlight the recently identified senotherapeutics, which provide new therapeutic strategies for treating kidney diseases."

This study focuses on developing and validating a machine learning - based predictive model to assess the clinical remission of CD patients at 12 and 48 weeks post - ADA treatment, while identifying the key influencing factors. A single - center retrospective study was conducted, involving patients from the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between 2017 and 2024. Comprehensive data on demographics, lifestyle, disease characteristics, and laboratory indicators were collected and preprocessed. The dataset was partitioned into an 80% training set and a 20% test set. Six machine learning models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine, were employed to construct the prediction model. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The SHAP analysis was performed to elucidate the key factors. The results indicated that the XGBoost model outperformed other models across multiple evaluation metrics. Fecal calprotectin (Fc), a marker of intestinal inflammation, showed that lower levels were associated with a tendency towards mucosal healing. C - reactive protein (CRP), on the other hand, reflected systemic inflammation. Both biomarkers significantly influenced the prediction outcomes at different time points. The developed model serves as a valuable tool for clinical stratification and personalized treatment planning. Future research should expand sample diversity through multi - center collaboration and integrate multi - omics data, such as gut microbiome and metabolomics, to further enhance the model's ability to capture the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease."

Using the scratch test in vitro, it was possible to demonstrate that γ-smooth muscle actin may be associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which was also shown by transcriptomic analysis. The presence of γ-smooth muscle actin-positive fibroblasts in histopathological sections of human tumours verified the expression of this protein as a new potential marker of CAFs."

    "text": "Lumbar drainage (LD) is essential in neurosurgery, but catheter occlusion remains a common complication impairing treatment effectiveness. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition has been associated with occlusion, the predictive value of individual parameters requires clarification. This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of CSF composition, particularly protein levels, in the development of catheter occlusion. This single-center, retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients who underwent lumbar drainage catheter placement at West China Hospital during the study period. Patients were followed until catheter removal. Catheter occlusion was defined as persistent drainage < 50 mL/day or abrupt cessation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of occlusion. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess predictive performance and determine optimal thresholds. Among 293 patients, 43 (14.7%) experienced catheter occlusion. The median CSF protein level was significantly higher in the occlusion group (9.48 g/L [IQR: 6.22-14.35]) than in the non-occlusion group (1.61 g/L [IQR: 1.05-2.64]) (p < 0.001). CSF cell count was also elevated in the occlusion group (360 × 10⁶/L [IQR: 100-1350]) relative to the non-occlusion group (27 × 10⁶/L [IQR: 10-200]); however, its discriminative capacity was inferior. CSF protein demonstrated high predictive performance, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.935. CSF protein level remained an independent predictor of occlusion in multivariate analysis (OR: 1.933; 95% CI: 1.543-2.421). The optimal protein threshold was 4.265 g/L. When stratified according to protein levels, the incidence of occlusion increased Markedly across groups: 3.3% in the low-protein group (≤ 4.2 g/L), 50.0% in the medium group (4.2-10 g/L), and 100% in the high-protein group (> 10 g/L) (p < 0.001). CSF protein is an independent predictor of lumbar drainage catheter occlusion with excellent discriminatory ability. A CSF protein level exceeding 4.2 g/L should be considered a clinical warning threshold. Early detection and timely intervention may help reduce occlusion-related complications and improve patient outcomes.Clinical trial number: Not applicable."

The authors should be commended for highlighting inguinal hernia as an underrecognized sequela of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and for pioneering the use of SHAP-based interpretation in this context. Their findings offer valuable groundwork for risk stratification and personalized counseling. While the study acknowledges several limitations, we wish to highlight additional concerns that warrant consideration. First, the reliance on a single, ethnically homogeneous cohort may limit generalizability across diverse populations. Second, omission of intraoperative surgical technique variables-such as Retzius-sparing approaches, peritoneal closure, or extraperitoneal access-restricts the model's ability to account for modifiable surgical factors. Third, the use of symptom-driven ultrasonography risks underdetection of subclinical hernias, introducing potential bias. Fourth, the one-year follow-up period may underestimate true incidence, as many cases manifest within 2-3 years postoperatively. Finally, the feature set was confined to five predictors, overlooking biological and functional variables such as collagen metabolism, frailty indices, and continence recovery, which are known to influence hernia development.We suggest that future research incorporate multicenter, ethnically diverse cohorts, longer follow-up, standardized imaging, and expanded biological and surgical predictors. These steps will enhance predictive accuracy, clinical utility, and generalizability. Our critique aims to complement the authors' contribution and foster refinement of machine learning models for postoperative complication risk prediction."

Therefore, screening for direct Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitors holds significant potential for addressing oxidative stress-related diseases. This study aims to develop an integrated approach to identify direct Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitors from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) using Achyranthis bidentatae Radix (ABR) as a case study. The approach incorporated ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis, data mining, drug-like property evaluation, molecular docking, chemical structure clustering, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in vitro experimental validation, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. A total of 517 compounds were identified in ABR, of which 248 met the drug-likeness criteria. Additionally, seventeen compounds from six structural clusters were identified as having theoretical Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitory activity. Among these compounds, shidasterone, nortrachelogenin, wogonin, and N-trans-feruloylmethoxytyramine were subjected to experimental evaluation for their Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitory and free radical scavenging activities. MD simulations and DFT calculations demonstrated that these compounds directly inhibited Keap1-Nrf2 PPI through hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges. Moreover, DFT calculations confirmed that these compounds scavenged free radicals via the hydrogen atom transfer mechanism. In conclusion, the strategy presented herein offers a robust framework for screening direct Keap1-Nrf2 PPI inhibitors with structural diversity from ABR and other TCM sources."

Current treatments, including repeated intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections, are invasive and often lead to discomfort and complicated hemorrhages. Here, we developed a noninvasive nanozyme eye drop capable of penetrating the fundus to eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thereby inhibit neovascularization. The nanozyme eye drops consist of liposomes formed by fluorinated and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid-modified phospholipids, which enhance the penetration of ocular barriers. The encapsulated superoxide dismutase-catalase cascade nanozyme within these liposomes allows for efficient ROS scavenging. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that these nanozyme eye drops achieve deep retinal tissue penetration, alleviate oxidative stress, restore mitochondrial function, and suppress aberrant insulin-like growth factor binding protein 6 signaling, thereby inhibiting pathological neovascularization. Enhanced ocular bioavailability and minimal toxicity further underscore its promise as a safe and effective noninvasive treatment for retinal neovascularization diseases."

However, due to the complicated design process and hard synthesis task, the development of traditional PROTAC drugs is both complex and costly, especially for the design of multitargeting PROTACs. Herein, considering the flexibility and efficacy of the split-and-mix strategy, we proposed a novel Multi-SM-PROTAC platform capable of stable performance with over three ligands simultaneously. In this study, the self-assembly advantage of the split-and-mix strategy was utilized to easily achieve: (1) the simultaneous degradation of dual targets, (2) multi-E3 ligase-mediated degradation of a single target, and (3) multi-E3 ligase-mediated degradation of dual targets. By successfully degrading multiple proteins, it was proven that the Multi-SM-PROTAC platform could achieve multimodule selection and programming for specific therapeutic goals, demonstrating its broad application prospects in drug discovery."

In this work, digestive properties and in vitro bioavailability index (IVBAI) of four animal-derived proteins (casein, casein phosphopeptide, collagen and gelatin) in canine and feline food were evaluated using in vitro simulated digestion and cell absorption experiments. The results of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated that arginine, serine, lysine and glycine were produced during gastrointestinal digestion of four proteins. Meanwhile, the scale of peptides produced by digestion as determined by liquid-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) were mainly concentrated below 2000 Da. Digestion kinetic results indicated that casein phosphopeptide (CPP) and collagen (Col) could be digested faster by canine and feline compared with other proteins. It is worth noting from the intestinal absorption of Caco-2 cells that more than 13 amino acids could be absorbed, but the peptides digested could be not easily transported through cells. Finally, higher IVBAI in canine was confirmed to be Col and CPP, reaching respectively 25.60%±1.28% and 12.30%±0.61%, while it in feline was confirmed to be gelatin (Gel) and CPP, reaching 24.70%±1.23% and 19.30%±0.96%, respectively. These results indicated that Col and CPP could be more easily digested and absorbed in canine, while Gel and CPP could be more easily digested and absorbed in feline. These findings could provide important reference for the selection of animal proteins and nutritional enhancement of pet food."

    "text": "Influenza is a contagious respiratory disease in humans, primarily caused by influenza A and B viruses. The severity of pandemic influenza is influenced by several factors, including the virus's ability to evade immune defenses such as autophagy, a key catabolic process within cells. Influenza A virus (IAV) exploits the autophagic pathway to facilitate its replication. In this study, we explored the impact of specific purified honey-derived peptide (H-P) on IAV-induced autophagy signaling, aiming to disrupt viral replication through host-directed strategies and potentially reduce the risk of viral mutation and resistance, as seen with antiviral drugs like Tamiflu. We examined the antiviral potential of H-P in human lung epithelial cells (A549) and compared its effects with Tamiflu and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as controls. To assess the safety of H-P, we first evaluated cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell morphology, and cell count following treatment with various concentrations of H-P or Tamiflu in the absence of infection. At lower concentrations, including 5 µM, both treatments showed minimal impact on cell viability, LDH levels, morphology, and cell count. Upon infection with IAV, treatment with 5 µM H-P significantly reduced the expression of both viral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and nucleoprotein (NP), whereas Tamiflu treatment at the same concentration reduced only NP expression. Mechanistic analyses revealed that H-P induced both early and late apoptotic signaling in infected cells, as demonstrated by Annexin V staining, suggesting its role in promoting apoptosis during early stages of infection. Additionally, H-P treatment significantly suppressed the expression of autophagy-related genes Atg5 and LC3B during the early stages of infection. It also inhibited the conversion of cytosolic LC3-I to membrane-bound LC3-II, even when autophagy was induced by rapamycin independently of infection. Notably, unlike Tamiflu, H-P increased the production of immune mediators, interferon-beta (IFN-β) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) specifically in response to IAV infection, without altering their expression in the absence of infection. Collectively, these findings highlight the antiviral potential of the naturally derived H-P polypeptide through suppression of IAV-stimulated autophagy, promotion of early apoptosis, and enhancement of antiviral cytokine responses. This suggests a promising host-targeted approach to influenza treatment that may complement or offer alternatives to conventional antiviral therapies like Tamiflu."

    "text": "Cancer remains a critical global health concern, affecting individuals across all age groups and claiming millions of lives annually. Early detection is essential, as it significantly improves prognosis and enhances survival rates. However, conventional diagnostic techniques, despite their accuracy, are often expensive, time-consuming, and inaccessible in remote or resource-limited areas. Moreover, diagnostic errors estimated to occur in 1% to 6% of cases are exacerbated by factors such as delayed detection, disease progression, and anatomical complexities. Electrochemical biosensors, a subset of point-of-care (PoC) technologies, offer a cost-effective and efficient alternative for early cancer detection. Their real-time analytical capabilities, combined with portability and ease of use, make them particularly suitable for rapid clinical decision-making and accessible cancer screening, especially in underserved settings. This review explores recent advancements in electrochemical biosensors for cancer detection, with an emphasis on the integration of advanced materials and nanotechnology into sensor platforms. The incorporation of diverse biomarkers, including DNA, RNA, and protein-based targets, into electrochemical sensors enhances diagnostic precision, sensitivity, and specificity. This approach provides valuable guidance for researchers in selecting accurate, application-specific biomarkers for advanced sensing technologies. The geometry and surface chemistry of the electrode play a critical role in determining the sensitivity and efficiency of electrochemical sensors. Optimized designs, such as disc-shaped and microneedle electrodes, along with tailored parameters like gap size and film thickness, significantly improve electroanalytical performance. Furthermore, this review presents an in-depth analysis of the commercial landscape and highlights emerging biomolecules associated with electrochemical biosensors. It evaluates their global market potential and their capacity to revolutionize cancer diagnostics. Electrochemical biosensors represent a promising convergence of technological innovation and clinical accessibility, offering advanced and practical solutions for early cancer detection. By enabling sensitive, specific, and cost-effective analysis of biological markers, these biosensors hold substantial promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating timely therapeutic intervention."

From the nutrients fueling microbiota growth, most carbon ends up in fermentation products and is absorbed by the host. This harvest varies strongly with the amount of complex dietary carbohydrates and is largely independent of bacterial mucin and protein utilization. It covers 2%-5% of human energy demand for Western diets and up to 10% for non-Western diets. Microbiota composition has little impact on the total harvest but determines the amount of specific fermentation products. This consistent quantification of metabolic fluxes by our analysis framework is crucial to elucidate the gut microbiota's mechanistic functions in health and disease."

So, we evaluated the effect of modality and membrane performance of dialysis session in children on maintenance HD on neutrophil activation by measuring the level of circulating neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Twenty-six incident children stable on LFHD for at least 3 months were recruited along with 26 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Pre-and post-session blood samples for complete blood count (CBC), C - reactive protein (CRP), and NETs were obtained on a mid-week session. Patients were shifted to HFHD for 3 months, followed by post-dilutional OL-HDF for additional 3 months. Blood tests were repeated at the end of each interval. Post-LFHD NETs levels were significantly higher than pre-LFHD (p = < 0.0001) and control levels (p < 0.0001). Both HFHD and OL-HDF resulted in significant reduction in the post-session NETs levels in comparison to their pre-session levels (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001 respectively). However, OL-HDF resulted in a significant reduction of post- session NETs levels to a degree that they became comparable to control levels (p = 0.928). We conclude that children on HD have high serum levels of NETs that were significantly increased by using LFHD membranes. HFHD and OL-HDF sessions led to significant reduction in NETs reflecting their possible role in reducing the dialysis related production of NETs, however OL-HDF was superior to HFHD, as it lowered post-session NETs to levels that were comparable to that of controls."

The levels of CSF VILIP-1 have been associated with memory decline and hippocampal atrophy, while no studies have investigated the association between CSF VILIP-1 levels and cerebral glucose metabolism among older adults.\n\nMETHODS: Study participants had available baseline CSF VILIP-1 data and more than two assessments of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F] FDG-PET) brain imaging. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between baseline CSF VILIP-1 levels and longitudinal changes in FDG-PET over time. Models were performed separately for the cognitively unimpaired (CU) and cognitively impaired (CI) participants.\n\nRESULTS: Among CU older adults, higher CSF VILIP-1 levels were marginally associated with a faster reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism. In CI older adults, CSF VILIP-1 levels were significantly associated with a faster reduction in cerebral glucose metabolism.\n\nCONCLUSION: These results provide novel insights into the relationship between neuronal injury and cerebral glucose metabolism, highlighting the potential of CSF VILIP-1 as a biomarker for monitoring and predicting the progression of neurodegenerative processes."

Iron deficiency represents one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies globally. As such, the aims of this study were (1) to assess the effect of lactoferrin, with different states of iron saturation, on the growth of a simple consortium of gut bacteria, and (2) to evaluate the impact of iron-saturated lactoferrin on the whole gut microbiome of elderly (healthy and frail) donors in an in vitro colon model. We report that iron-depleted and native lactoferrin inhibited consortium growth, while the iron-saturated form resulted in changes in consortium composition by enhancing the growth of Alistipes putredinis. Fermentation experiments with whole faecal microbiomes showed that the elderly microbiota composition was modified by iron-saturated lactoferrin, mainly in the case of healthy subjects, by altering beta diversity through the modulation of healthy-aging associated taxa including Coprococcus, Alistipes and Bifidobacterium. These findings indicate the positive role that iron saturated lactoferrin may provide in modulating the microbiota of the elderly in vitro, increasing the α-diversity with the modulation of groups that are normally abundant in healthy individuals and that are typically lost in the transition from a healthy to frail microbiota profile."

Existing studies have shown that mitochondrial fusion mediated by mitochondrial fusion protein 2 (Mfn2) is closely associated with DIC, and that upregulation of Mfn2 reduces drug-induced cardiomyocyte damage and apoptosis, suggesting that Mfn2 could be a potential biomarker for early warning assessment of DIC. Due to the defects of cumbersome operation, limited sensitivity, high cost, and difficulty in popularization of existing detection technologies, this study pioneers a novel electrochemical immunosensor for highly sensitive Mfn2 detection using a composite sensing substrate of MXene-derived sodium titanate nanorods and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (M-NTO-MWCNT). This technology enables early warning and assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity. The M-NTO component, with its unique nanorod structure, abundant active sites, and high surface area, significantly enhances sensitivity and provides abundant antibody immobilization sites. Meanwhile, MWCNTs improve electron transfer efficiency and selectivity due to their superior conductivity and interconnected network. Under optimized conditions, the sensor achieves a detection Limit as low as 1.85 ng mL"

This study suggested that abnormal activation of TMEM16A might contribute to its pathogenesis. A drug screening identified thymol, a natural product, as a significant inhibitor of TMEM16A channel activity. Thymol induced a conformational change in the TM3-TM6 helices by interacting with the amino acid residues K603, E633, and V543, which reduced the ionic pore size of TMEM16A to less than 3 Å and inhibited chloride transport across the membrane. In a mouse model of secretory diarrhea induced by senna, thymol significantly alleviated diarrhea symptoms by reducing intestinal smooth muscle contractions. Both cellular and mouse experiments indicated that thymol mitigated diarrhea by regulating chloride ion secretion and suppressing inflammation, and it exhibited no toxicity to normal intestinal cells or mice. Therefore, this study concluded that thymol targeted TMEM16A to treat secretory diarrhea through a dual mechanism and represented a safe and effective therapeutic candidate for diarrhea. This work provided a foundation for the development of antidiarrheal natural drugs."

This study investigates how sucralose exacerbates allergic responses in mice that are OVA-sensitized through specific immunologic mechanisms. Sucralose exposure markedly aggravated allergic symptoms, including diarrhea, elevated serum IgE, MCP-1, and mast cell mediators, and preferentially enhanced Th2 responses without affecting Th1 or Treg cytokine pathways. At the cellular level, sucralose stimulated dendritic cells (DCs) activation, increasing expression of MHCII (OVA +5 mM vs OVA, +46.81%) and CD80/CD86 (OVA +5 mM vs OVA, +37.12%/12.29%), and promoting Th2 polarization via altered cytokine profiles. Importantly, sucralose activated the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathways in DCs, boosting pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-1β releases, which amplified T cell activation and allergic inflammation. The findings indicated that sucralose potentiates the OVA-induced FA by activating DC-mediated TLR4 activation, thereby augmenting pro-inflammatory production and sustaining allergic responses. These findings highlighted the potential immunological risks associated with widespread sucralose consumption."

It is driven by both intrinsic factors-such as genetic predisposition and hormonal changes-and extrinsic influences like ultraviolet radiation, environmental pollutants, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. Conventional topical treatments, including moisturizers and sunscreens, offer only transient effects due to limited dermal penetration. In recent years, dermal implants have emerged as promising alternatives for skin rejuvenation, providing enhanced bioavailability, prolonged therapeutic effects, and minimal invasiveness. Among various biomaterials, collagen stands out for its excellent biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and intrinsic bioactivity. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in implantable strategies for aged skin repair, categorizing materials into five major types: inorganic fillers, synthetic polymers, hyaluronic acid-based, collagen-based, and composite implants. Their structural properties, regenerative mechanisms, and clinical performances are critically compared. Special attention is given to collagen-based implants-hydrogels, fibers, and microspheres-for their roles in modulating inflammation, promoting endogenous collagen synthesis, and facilitating dermal remodeling. The review concludes with an overview of commercialized products and discusses future directions toward precision anti-aging therapies."

However, longitudinal data on immune durability and breakthrough infections, especially in immunocompromised groups, remain limited. This study evaluates humoral response in healthy individuals after primary vaccine series and booster dose, and assesses long-term hybrid immunity up to two years post-booster in both healthy individuals and immunocompromised kidney transplant recipients (KTRs). BNT162b2 vaccine elicited a stronger anti-spike (anti-S) antibody response (3.0 log U/mL) compared to CoronaVac (1.6 log U/mL) at 3 months post-second dose. Anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibody seroconversion was 50.3 % in CoronaVac recipients, suggesting limited humoral responses against N protein. Booster vaccination with homologous or heterologous mRNA-based regimens (BNT162b2/BNT162b2, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2, and CoronaVac/BNT162b2) further enhanced anti-S antibody responses (3.6-3.7 log U/mL) for up to 6 months, whereas homologous CoronaVac/CoronaVac boosters yielded lower antibody levels (2.8 log U/mL). Breakthrough infections triggered a rapid rise in anti-N antibody, followed by a decline back to pre-infection levels within 3 months. In individuals infected two years after booster vaccination, T cell responses increased in healthy participants but declined in KTRs despite strong antibody responses, suggesting immunosuppressive therapy may impair T cell activation. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive immune assessments to guide preventive strategies, especially for immunocompromised populations."

This study introduces an innovative bilayer polyurethane composite dressing featuring distinct functional layers. The polyurethane protective layer (PUPL), fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane-based polyurethane, functions as a hydrophobic, mechanically robust barrier that simultaneously provides structural integrity, flexibility, and effective protection against fluid penetration and environmental contaminants, thereby minimizing external interference with the wound healing process. The polyurethane functional layer (PUFL) comprises cationically and zwitterionically modified polyurethane pressure-sensitive adhesives, engineered to exhibit optimal differential adhesion properties in both wet and dry conditions along with multifunctional characteristics. This modification strategy harnesses the antimicrobial efficacy of cationic polymers while mitigating potential wound inflammation through zwitterionic ions that reduce cation-induced protein adsorption. Furthermore, incorporating polyethylene glycol into the polyurethane pressure-sensitive adhesive's soft segment enhances the material's hydrophilicity and moisture retention capacity, promoting an optimal moist wound healing environment. The resulting bilayer dressing demonstrates superior mechanical properties, excellent flexibility, and appropriate water vapor transmission rates, enabling secure wound adhesion. Moreover, it exhibits remarkable biocompatibility along with pronounced antimicrobial and antifouling capabilities. The synergistic interaction between the hydrophobic protective layer and the functional adhesive layer offers a promising platform for advancing next-generation wound healing materials."

This prospective, open-label, interventional, single-arm clinical trial involved a 24-week follow-up, enrolling patients with RA who had achieved clinical remission during treatment with originator IFX. CT-P13 was switched from the originator IFX with an unchanged dosing regimen for 24 weeks. The study utilized not only clinical disease activity indices but also MSUS and serum cytokines/chemokines. Eighteen patients were evaluated during the study period. From baseline to week 24, two of the 18 patients experienced clinical relapse (11.1% [95% CI: 3.1-32.8]). No changes were observed in the MSUS score, including total grayscale and power Doppler scores, Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28)-erythrocyte sedimentation rate, DAS28-C-reactive protein, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, and van der Heijde-modified total Sharp score from baseline to week 24. Serum levels of multiple cytokines/chemokines showed no apparent changes. Three non-serious adverse events occurred, with no study discontinuations due to adverse events. In conclusion, most RA patients undergoing treatment with originator IFX in clinical remission could safely switch to CT-P13 without an increased risk of relapse, as evidenced by MSUS, clinical indices, and biomarker levels."

The use of osteobiologics to enhance fusion has emerged as a promising alternative to address the limitations of autologous iliac crest bone graft (AICBG), but their comparative efficacy and safety remain unclear. This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to assess the fusion rates, safety profiles, and clinical outcomes of the use of osteobiologics in LSF.\n\nMETHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different osteobiologics to AICBG in LSF. Data on fusion rates, complications, pain, disability, blood loss, operative time, and length of stay (LOS) were extracted. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias-2 tool, and the certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE framework. The NMA was performed using a frequentist random-effects model to compare the efficacy and safety of various osteobiologics, along with associated perioperative and clinical outcomes.\n\nRESULTS: Forty-three RCTs including a total of 3,823 patients were identified. The use of rhBMP-2 (recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2) significantly improved fusion rates (odds ratio [OR]: 3.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.59 to 5.32; p < 0.0001) and reduced complications (OR: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.68; p < 0.0001) compared with AICBG, with moderate certainty of the evidence. Other osteobiologics, including ABM/P-15 (anorganic bone matrix/15-amino acid peptide fragment) and allograft, demonstrated reduced complication rates, although the quality of the evidence was low to very low. No significant differences were observed for pain, disability, or LOS. The use of rhBMP-2, autologous local bone, and silicate-substituted calcium phosphate was associated with decreased operative time, with rhBMP-2 additionally associated with lower intraoperative blood loss.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Use of rhBMP-2 was associated with significantly higher fusion and lower complication rates compared with AICBG, as well as decreased operative time and blood loss. Other osteobiologics may also offer benefits, but the supporting evidence is low-quality and limited by the notable underrepresentation of these materials in the published literature.\n\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level I .

The algorithm would identify potential differential diagnoses where MSUS protocols targeted for specific diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, polymyalgia rheumatica, and osteoarthritis) could be applied. The joint sites and elementary lesions for each disease were selected based on a previously performed systematic literature review (SLR) and consensus. Finally, we conducted a pilot study on patients with new-onset arthritis to assess the performance of the algorithm, comparing the algorithm-based diagnosis with the final clinical diagnosis.\n\nRESULTS: Based on the consensus and the surveys, age, the number of involved joints, anti-citrullinated protein antibody, rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were included in the algorithm.

The agreement between the diagnosis selected by the algorithm and the final diagnosis by the rheumatologist was 88.1%. The elementary lesions and joint sites included in the different MSUS protocols were selected based on the best diagnostic accuracy, as shown by the SLR and defined by the working group.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: The developed algorithm was accurate in identifying the correct diagnosis. Thus, it could reliably drive the decision on the MSUS assessment to perform. The RADIAL study will further investigate the feasibility and added value of MSUS in the diagnostic workflow according to this newly developed clinical suspicion-driven algorithm."

Diagnosis relies on clinical symptoms and exclusionary criteria, lacking objective biomarker.\n\nPURPOSE: To investigate metabolic patterns of intracerebral lesions and identify diagnostic biomarkers for NPSLE using translocator protein (TSPO) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR).\n\nMETHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 19 patients with NPSLE and 10 patients with non-NPSLE, who underwent [\n\nRESULTS: SUVmax was significantly higher in the NPSLE group than in the non-NPSLE group (p<0.01), while there was no significant difference in SUVmean (p>0.05). SUVmax was correlated with clinical assessment scores (SLICC/ACR: r=0.43, p=0.02; modified Rankin Scale: r=0.41, p=0.04; SLE Disease Activity Index: r=0.41, p=0.03), and no significant correlation was found for SUVmean. In logistic regression analysis, only the model based on SUVmax alone was significant (p=0.01). In ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) of SUVmax (0.83) was higher than that of SUVmean (0.68), and Model 4 (SUVmax+SUVmean + Interaction) showed the best diagnostic performance (AUC=0.94).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with NPSLE and non-NPSLE showed distinct TSPO uptake in brain lesions, indicating different pathophysiology. TSPO PET/MR may serve as a potential imaging biomarker for differentiating NPSLE, providing insights for clinical diagnosis and mechanistic stratification in SLE."

The objective of the study is to develop a prognostic indicator for BCR using machine learning (ML) and motor protein-related genes (MPRGs).\n\nMETHODS: The prognosis relevance of the MPRGs in prostate cancer was analyzed by univariate Cox regression. Feature selection and model construction were performed using combinations of multiple machine learning algorithms. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and C-index. Patients were stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the risk signature, and comparisons of BCR incidence, gene expression profiles, immune cell infiltration patterns, and drug sensitivity were conducted between these groups. The gene expression of MPRGs were validated in vitro.\n\nRESULTS: Among 120 MPRGs, 17 were differentially expressed, of which 8 were significantly associated with BCR. A novel risk scoring system using a StepCox[forward] + Ridge model based on these 8 MPRGs effectively stratified patients into two different risk groups, and patients with high riskscores had significantly higher BCR rates than those with lower riskscores. Enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of inflammation response, EMT, hypoxia, and estrogen response pathways in the high-risk category, while mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets were downregulated. The MPRG-derived risk score correlated positively with M2 macrophage infiltration and ngatively correlated with CD4 T cells and mast cells, and the high-risk category showed higher sensitivity to drugs like cisplatin and bicalutamide. The final nomogram based on MPRGs-derived signature and T stage provided an excellent tool for predicting BCR. In vitro experiments further validated that the expression trends of MPRGs in the risk signature were consistent with the bioinformatics analysis results.\n\nCONCLUSION: This study developed a novel MPRG-derived risk signature that effectively predicts BCR in prostate cancer, offering valuable insights for clinical management and personalized treatment strategies."

In this study, 329 fungal-derived compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit MrkD1P, a key fimbrial adhesin protein (PDB ID: 3U4K) involved in host tissue adhesion. Molecular docking analysis identified ochratoxin A (- 9.1 kcal/mol), bromadiolone (- 8.6 kcal/mol), and permethrin (- 8.2 kcal/mol) as top-performing candidates, exhibiting strong binding affinities and stable molecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic contacts. These findings were reinforced by 100-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which showed sustained ligand-protein stability, particularly for ochratoxin A. Free energy estimations using the MM/PBSA method further suggested the thermodynamic favourability of these interactions. Pharmacokinetic profiling (ADMET) indicated favourable absorption and distribution properties for all three compounds, with low toxicity predictions, though some hepatotoxicity was noted. Principal component analysis (PCA) demonstrated that ochratoxin A and permethrin induced substantial alterations in protein dynamics, suggesting ligand-specific structural effects. Experimental validation confirmed the antibacterial activity of ochratoxin A against K. pneumoniae, producing a 34 ± 0.67 mm inhibition zone at 100 µg/disc, surpassing ciprofloxacin (33 mm) with a MIC of 18.33 ± 0.72 µg/mL and MBC of 39.33 ± 1.36 µg/mL (p < 0.05). Collectively, these in silico and in vitro results highlight fungal metabolites, particularly ochratoxin A, as promising therapeutic leads against MDR K. pneumoniae. However, further in vivo investigations are required to establish their safety and clinical potential."

    "text": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has a preclinical period of 5-10 years preceding the appearance of joint pain and swelling characteristic of clinical RA. Preclinical RA has been characterized by circulating IgA and IgG classes of autoantibodies targeting citrullinated protein antigens (ACPAs) that are highly specific for future clinical RA, circulating IgA plasmablasts, and autoantibody production at mucosal sites, all of which point toward mucosal tissues as the origin of immune dysregulation. In individuals at risk for developing and with established RA, oral and gut microbial shifts correlate with immune activation. Specific bacterial taxa such as Segatella copri, Subdoligranulum didolesgii, Eggerthella lenta, and Streptococcal species have been shown to contribute to the development and/or perpetuation of RA through mechanisms that include molecular mimicry, antigen citrullination, and disruption of mucosal immunity. Furthermore, microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan derivatives, regulate immune homeostasis and offer potential therapeutic avenues. The gut microbiome also influences therapeutic responses by modulating conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. This Review synthesizes current knowledge on the bacterial microbiome's role in RA pathogenesis and treatment responses, highlighting microbiome-targeted interventions as potential strategies for disease prevention and management."

The association with AF was attenuated and nonsignificant after adjusting for estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin-creatinine ratio. The CML-HF relation was similarly attenuated after adjusting for time-updated myocardial infarction.

Compared with placebo, henagliflozin significantly increases telomere length (primary endpoint), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 levels, and β-hydroxybutyrate levels and improves glucose metabolism. Immune analysis reveals that henagliflozin significantly increases granzyme B expression in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and tends to increase perforin expression in CTLs and perforin and granzyme B expression in total T lymphocytes. Metabolomic analysis shows that henagliflozin induces changes in various metabolites, including increased thiamine levels and enhanced thiamine metabolism.

This study characterizes postprandial multi-omics dynamics under mixed meals and four distinct macronutrient loads, investigating hormone secretion patterns, associated responsive molecules, and their relationships with IR. Postprandial multi-omics data significantly elucidate insulin and glucagon secretion, highlighting differences from the fasting state, while glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are exclusively explained postprandially. Hormone secretion and molecular responses exhibit substantial heterogeneity among macronutrients. Postprandial multi-omics better predict IR, particularly with hepatic enrichment. Protein load shows the strongest association with both hepatic and muscular IR, while butter mostly connects with systemic IR. Several identified molecules mediate interactions between IR and islet α and β cell function, providing a molecular basis for advancing precision nutrition therapies in metabolic diseases."

The final date of follow-up was March 21, 2025.\n\nINTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to either the standard therapy group (n = 266), receiving toripalimab with gemcitabine-cisplatin induction chemotherapy and concurrent cisplatin-radiotherapy (100 mg/m2 triweekly for 2 cycles), or the concurrent cisplatin-sparing group (n = 266), receiving the same regimen without concurrent cisplatin. The 17 cycles of toripalimab (240 mg triweekly) were distributed across the induction, radiotherapy, and adjuvant phases as 3, 3, and 11 cycles, respectively.\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Coprimary end points were failure-free survival (noninferiority margin, 8%) and incidence of all-grade vomiting (superiority design). Secondary end points included overall survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, safety, tumor response, quality of life, and tolerability.\n\nRESULTS: In the 532 patients in the intention-to-treat population (median [IQR] age, 47 [39-54] years; 25.2% women), after a median follow-up of 37.0 (range, 4.0-50.0) months, the concurrent cisplatin-sparing group had a 3-year failure-free survival rate of 88.3% vs 87.6% in the standard therapy group, a difference of 0.7% (lower limit of the 1-sided 95% CI, -3.9%; P = .002 for noninferiority; stratified hazard ratio, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.66-1.79]; log-rank P = .73).

We collected and tested blood specimens with a SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein-based serological assay. We calculated crude prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk factors.\n\nRESULTS: A total of 253 HCWs were included. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was 34% from September to October 2021 and 92% from October 2022 to April 2023 during the Delta and the Omicron variant surges, respectively, at one facility. At the other facility, seroprevalence was 31% in September-October 2021. Of the 33 seropositive HCWs with questionnaire completed, 14 (42%) did not recall COVID-19-like symptoms in the past year. Serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was statistically more likely among HCWs who recalled COVID-19-like symptoms in the past year (PR, 2.69 [95% CI: 1.53-4.72]; P < .05). Of the seropositive HCWs, 7 (21%) had no hospital documentation of missed work. Of the 24 HCWs with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, 12 (50%) tested because of symptoms, 4 (17%) tested after exposure, and 5 (21%) tested following employment screening.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Self-reported symptoms may be used to track SARS-CoV-2 prior infections within resource-limited healthcare settings. Occupational health services should consider these findings when developing infection monitoring strategies among HCWs. Combining surveillance strategies may strengthen infection monitoring."

Each patient's scar was randomly divided into 2 equal parts, with 1 part receiving TAC + BTX-A and the other BTX-A alone for 3 sessions at 4-week intervals. Scar thickness was measured with calipers, and the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) was administered to assess scar condition. Pain and pruritus were evaluated with a numeric rating scale (NRS) and visual analog scale (VAS), respectively, before each intervention (V1, V2, V3) and 4 weeks after the last session (V4). In the animal study, rats with burn scars were assigned to 5 groups: sham, untreated burn, TAC, BTX-A, and TAC + BTX-A. Scar thickness and expressions of alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), collagen I/III, laminin, and fibronectin were analyzed histologically.\n\nRESULTS: Clinically, both therapies reduced scar thickness, VSS, NRS, and VAS scores. However, combination therapy showed superior reductions in scar thickness (V2-V4) and VSS scores (V3, V4) compared to BTX-A monotherapy. No significant differences were observed in NRS and VAS scores. The animal study confirmed that combination therapy more effectively reduced scar thickness, TGF-β and CTGF levels, and the collagen I/III ratio, and increased the laminin/fibronectin ratio.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: TAC + BTX-A combination therapy enhances scar reduction by more effectively suppressing fibroblast proliferation and activation through TGF-β and CTGF downregulation, promoting scar remodeling."

Increased concentrations of highly reactive dicarbonyl compounds-methylglyoxal (MGO), glyoxal (GO), and/or 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG)-may cause arterial stiffening via formation of advanced glycation end products, triggering maladaptive responses in vascular tissue, e.g., elastin degradation and collagen cross-linking. Therefore, we investigated in the population-based Maastricht study whether plasma MGO, GO, and 3-DG concentrations were cross-sectionally associated with carotid-to-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) and local carotid stiffness measures: pulse wave velocity (cPWV), and Young's elastic modulus (cYEM) using standardized main variables.\n\nMETHODS: Fasting dicarbonyl concentrations were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in EDTA plasma collected from 2,275 participants (age 60 ± 8 years, mean ± SD; 49% women, 605 (27%) with type 2 diabetes mellitus) of the Maastricht Study, an observational, population-based cohort study. Cross-sectional associations were assessed using multivariable linear regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, lifestyle factors, and medication. Since arterial stiffness measures are intrinsically pressure dependent, we additionally assessed the associations with pressure-corrected counterparts, instead of statistically correcting for MAP.\n\nRESULTS: Fasting dicarbonyl concentrations were associated with arterial stiffness measures (greater cfPWV, cPWV, and cYEM) in most crude models, but not in adjusted models. The use of pressure-corrected metrics did not materially change the association of interest.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Fasting plasma concentrations of either MGO, GO, or 3-DG are not independently associated with arterial stiffness in this cross-sectional analysis."

    "text": "CONTEXT: Jansen metaphyseal chondrodysplasia (JMC) is an ultra-rare autosomal dominant disease that is caused by heterozygous, activating PTH1R mutations resulting in PTH- and PTHrP-independent hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, leading to nephrocalcinosis and impaired renal function later in life. The activated PTH1R plays critical roles in mineral ion homeostasis and bone lengthening, as well as bone formation and resorption. Currently, little is known about bone turnover markers and bone histomorphometric changes in JMC patients.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess changes in bone microarchitecture, bone formation, and bone protein expression in 2 pediatric patients with JMC harboring the H223R-PTHR1 mutation.\n\nMETHODS: Bone histomorphometry, immunohistochemistry, and histologic analyses were conducted on iliac crest biopsy samples from 2 male siblings affected by JMC (ages 6 and 8 years) and 9 healthy control males of similar age, with normal kidney function.\n\nRESULTS: Both patients with JMC displayed irregular bone architecture, increased osteoid, and a prolonged osteoid maturation process. While trabecular volume remained normal, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased in PTH1R expression in both osteoblasts and fibroblastic cells on the bone surface. Cortical bone displayed areas of intense osteoclast activity and scattered marrow fibrosis. Remarkably, osteocytes in samples from patients with JMC had osteoid buildup within their lacunae and canaliculi that were both shorter and less abundant. DMP1 immunohistochemistry highlighted the abnormal canalicular network in patients. FGF23 staining in osteocytes was enhanced while sclerostin was diminished.\n\nCONCLUSION: The H223R-PTH1R mutation in patients with JMC leads to bone structural irregularities, hypomineralization, abnormal osteocyte morphology, and altered expression of osteocyte-derived proteins. These findings underscore the multifaceted impact of the mutant PTH1R on bone physiology and focus attention on the osteocyte as a cellular target for therapeutic intervention. Whether normalizing gene expression in osteocytes is possible and can improve bone health in patients with JMC remains to be seen. Assessment of osteocyte morphology and function may provide novel diagnostic endpoints for future clinical trials with JMC therapeutics."

    "text": "Single-round infectious rotavirus, which lacks a gene essential for virion assembly, serves not only as a safe and effective rotavirus vaccine but also as an orally-administrable viral vector vaccine that induces mucosal immunity. Previously, we generated a single-round infectious rotavirus by partially deleting the viral VP6 gene, and demonstrated its potential as a promising vaccine platform. However, this system has several limitations; namely, low viral protein expression levels and safety concerns. Here, we addressed these challenges by introducing large deletions into the VP7 or VP4 genes, which are dispensable for viral protein expression but essential for virion assembly. These VP7- or VP4-defective viruses exhibited markedly higher protein expression in wild-type MA104 cells than the previously developed VP6-defective virus. In addition, the large deletions reduce the risk of viral reversion, thereby increasing both efficacy and safety. In a mouse model, these viruses induced neutralizing antibodies at levels comparable with those elicited by wild-type rotavirus, indicating their potential as rotavirus vaccines. Moreover, a VP4-defective rotavirus harboring a heterologous gene achieved high expression of heterologous proteins, warranting its application as a viral vector vaccine. To further increase safety, we established a reverse genetics system for the bovine rotavirus WC3 strain, a parental strain of the licensed live attenuated rotavirus vaccine, and successfully generated a single-round VP4-defective rotavirus based on the WC3 backbone. Taken together, these optimizations facilitate development of safe and effective single-round infectious rotavirus platforms suitable for human use."

Emerging evidence suggests that gut dysbiosis (microbial imbalance) may influence neuroinflammation and cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, potentially contributing to glymphatic system dysfunction and ventricular enlargement. This study used shotgun metagenomics to analyze the gut microbiome in iNPH patients (n = 18) compared to healthy controls (n = 50), individuals with ventriculomegaly but no iNPH symptoms (n = 50), and Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 50). Microbiome analysis showed an enrichment of species previously linked to various disease states, such as Enterocloster bolteae and Ruminococcus gnavus, indicating general dysbiosis. In contrast, enrichment of specific taxa, including Evtepia gabavorous and Cuneatibacter sp., were specifically associated with iNPH clinical traits, pointing to possible disease-specific microbial markers. Functional analysis showed enrichment of pathways related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, including the S-adenosyl-L-methionine superpathway, implicating inflammatory and immune processes. These findings suggest distinct gut microbiome signatures in iNPH, offering insights into potential gut-brain interactions that may contribute to the disorder's pathophysiology and highlighting possible targets for future therapeutic strategies."

Despite advances in surgical techniques and antimicrobial therapy, outcomes remain suboptimal in high-risk patients. Hemoadsorption using the CytoSorb® device has emerged as a potential adjunctive therapy to mitigate systemic inflammation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery, but its clinical benefit in IE remains under evaluation. CASE REPORT We describe a series of 4 adult patients with confirmed bacterial IE involving the aortic or tricuspid valve, all requiring urgent cardiac surgery. Each patient exhibited clinical signs of sepsis, persistent fever, elevated inflammatory markers, and vegetation on echocardiography. Intraoperatively, CytoSorb hemoadsorption was integrated into the CPB circuit. In all cases, a significant reduction in inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, procalcitonin), lactate, and vasopressor requirements was observed within 24 hours postoperatively. Mechanical ventilation duration was below institutional averages. No patients required re-operation, mechanical circulatory support, or postoperative hemoadsorption. All were discharged between postoperative days 7 and 17, and follow-up at 6 months revealed no complications or relapses. CONCLUSIONS This case series suggests that intraoperative hemoadsorption using CytoSorb may be a beneficial adjunct in the surgical management of severe IE, particularly in patients with high inflammatory burden. Improvements in hemodynamic stability, inflammatory response, and postoperative recovery were consistently observed. These findings support the need for randomized controlled trials to evaluate patient selection criteria and confirm therapeutic efficacy."

    "text": "The microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) is an intricate bidirectional communication network that links intestinal microbiota with the central nervous system (CNS) through immune, neural, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of the MGBA plays pivotal roles in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This review outlines the key molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes modulate neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier integrity, protein misfolding, and neuronal homeostasis. We discuss how microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan derivatives, and bile acids, interact with host to influence CNS functions. Disease-specific features are described across Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, emphasizing the distinct and overlapping pathways through which gut dysbiosis may contribute to pathogenesis. We further explore the translational potential of microbiota-targeted therapies, including probiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, dietary interventions, and small-molecule modulators. While preclinical results are promising, clinical trials reveal considerable variability, highlighting the need for personalized approaches and robust biomarkers. Challenges remain in deciphering causal relationships, accounting for inter-individual variability, and ensuring reproducibility in therapeutic outcomes. Future research should integrate multi-omics strategies, longitudinal human cohorts, and mechanistic models to clarify the role of the MGBA in neurodegeneration. Collectively, understanding the MGBA provides a transformative perspective on neurodegenerative disease mechanisms and offers innovative therapeutic avenues that bridge neurology, microbiology, and precision medicine."

Plant protein sources can also be beneficial, possibly due to their content of phytochemicals. Whereas dietary guidelines emphasize limiting intake of saturated fat for reducing cardiovascular risk by lowering concentrations of LDL cholesterol, this has not been shown to have an impact on atherogenic dyslipidemia. Attenuation or reversal of atherogenic dyslipidemia can be achieved by adopting a dietary pattern that emphasizes moderating carbohydrate intake, in particular processed grains and added sugars, rather than by focusing primarily on limiting saturated fat and its effects on LDL-cholesterol."

LATE and Alzheimer's disease (AD) share similar clinical features, and their underlying neuropathological changes-LATE-NC and ADNC-commonly co-occur. However, the histomorphological and molecular features of TDP-43 pathology in LATE-NC with or without coexisting ADNC are not yet well understood. We performed immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded tissue from the hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal and frontal cortices of 108 human autopsy cases including 20 cognitively unimpaired controls, 20 AD dementia cases with moderate-high severity of ADNC without LATE-NC (ADNC group), 34 AD dementia cases with LATE-NC (ADNC + LATE-NC group), 17 dementia cases with LATE-NC but no/low ADNC (pure LATE-NC group), and 17 FTLD-TDP Type A cases. We assessed TDP-43 aggregate morphology and composition using antibodies against different TDP-43 epitopes: pS409/410, pS403/pS404, and C- and N-terminal TDP-43. We also investigated nuclear clearance of physiological TDP-43 and cytoplasmic colocalization of TDP-43 and tau proteins. Pure LATE-NC cases were on average 10 years older at death than ADNC + LATE-NC, had less cognitive impairment, higher prevalence of argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) pathology, aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), and APOEε2 allele. They also tended to show lower APOEε4 frequencies, but similar frequencies of hippocampal sclerosis and LATE-NC stages. Importantly, LATE-NC predominantly displayed a mesh-like neuritic TDP-43 pattern in the hippocampus, extending from CA1/2 to subiculum. This mesh-like pattern was present in 81% of pure LATE-NC cases and only in 18% of ADNC + LATE-NC. This pattern was also observed in 53% of FTLD-TDP Type A cases. Moreover, the aggregate composition differed in pure LATE-NC and ADNC + LATE-NC, with LATE-NC cases exhibiting increased burdens of several phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated TDP-43 species, while only the pS409/pS410 epitope was significantly associated with ADNC + LATE-NC in the amygdala. Nuclear clearance patterns also tended to differ between pure LATE-NC and ADNC + LATE-NC. Similar to ADNC + LATE-NC, TDP-43 and tau proteinopathies colocalized in pure LATE-NC with comorbid primary age-related tauopathy (PART) or low ADNC. These data suggest that LATE-NC tends to be modified in the presence of moderate-high ADNC. These differences may reflect upstream influences (age, genetics, and environmental risk factors), direct protein-protein interactions, and/or other impacts of ADNC-related mechanisms on TDP-43 proteinopathy, potentially relevant for clinical trial design and future therapeutic applications."

There were 77 males and 121 females with an average age of 63.74 years ranging from 24 to 92 years. There were 90 cases of hip arthroplasty and 108 cases of knee arthroplasty. PJI was diagnosed according to the 2013 American Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) standard diagnostic criteria. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predict value (PPV) were calculated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the diagnostic performance of the three methods, and the area under curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance.\n\nRESULTS: According to the 2013 MSIS criteria, 116 cases were diagnosed as PJI, and the remaining 82 cases were aseptic loosening. The cases of PJI diagnosed by TPBS, CRP, and TPBS-CRP were 125, 109, and 137 respectively, and the cases of aseptic loosening were 73, 89, and 61 respectively. The sensitivity, accuracy, NPV, and PPV of TPBS-CRP combination in the diagnosis of PJI were higher than those of TPBS and CRP, but the specificity was lower than that of TPBS and CRP. ROC curve analysis further showed that the AUC value of TPBS-CRP combination was better than that of TPBS and CRP. The severity of bone defect and the duration of symptoms in patients with false positive TPBS diagnosis were worse than those in patients with true negative TPBS diagnosis (\n\nCONCLUSION: TPBS and CRP have limited specificity in differentiating PJI from aseptic loosening. The TPBS-CRP combination diagnostic method can synergize the local bone metabolic characteristics and systemic inflammatory response to achieve higher diagnostic accuracy, but caution should be exercised in patients with severe bone defects and longer symptom duration."

FOXO3, a key regulator of aging, apoptosis, and oxidative stress-induced cell death, was investigated for its role and regulatory mechanisms in UVB-induced oxidative stress using human lens epithelial cells (HLECs). A progressive decrease in FOXO3 protein expression was observed in the lens capsules across various stages of cataract progression, as well as in UVB-exposed animal models and UVB-treated HLECs. Functional assays demonstrated that FOXO3 overexpression protected HLECs against UVB-induced damage by increasing cell viability, reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and suppressing apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the AMPK/FOXO3 signaling pathway is involved in this protective mechanism, as AMPK inhibition restored FOXO3 expression and mitigated UVB-induced cellular damage. Additionally, lncRNA SNHG12 was identified as a potential candidate regulated by FOXO3. Overexpressing FOXO3 in HLECs resulted in reduced lncRNA SNHG12 expression, whereas FOXO3 knockdown elevated lncRNA SNHG12 levels. Further luciferase reporter assays validated their interaction, revealing FOXO3 as a negative regulator of SNHG12 expression. Moreover, the knockdown of SNHG12 significantly attenuated apoptosis and oxidative stress induced by UVB in HLECs. In conclusion, these findings suggest that FOXO3 alleviates UVB-induced oxidative stress in lens epithelial cells through the AMPK/FOXO3 pathway and regulation of SNHG12, providing a potential therapeutic target for ARC."

    "text": "Chronic wounds, exacerbated by bacterial infections and oxidative stress, remain a formidable challenge in clinical wound management. Here, we introduce a multifunctional conductive dressing composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS), a citric acid-β-cyclodextrin supramolecular system, and cyclodextrin-polyoxometalates (CD-POM). This dressing integrates electrical stimulation (ES), antioxidative capacity, anti-inflammatory effects, and antibacterial efficacy to promote tissue regeneration. Its good mechanical robustness, strong adhesion, and optimized electrical conductivity arise from synergistic interactions among PVA, PEDOT: PSS, and the supramolecular system. Moreover, the addition of CD-POM enables efficient scavenging of reactive oxygen species, thereby mitigating oxidative damage and creating a favorable healing microenvironment. ES further enhances fibroblast proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, while simultaneously disrupting bacterial biofilms and boosting antibacterial performance. In vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm that the conductive dressing significantly accelerates wound closure, reduces inflammation, and promotes collagen deposition. Altogether, this study presents a promising bioelectronic wound dressing strategy that addresses both bacterial infections and oxidative stress, offering an advanced therapeutic platform for chronic wound management. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic wounds are characterized by persistent bacterial infection and excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which impair tissue regeneration. While conductive hydrogels with electrical stimulation (ES) have emerged as promising wound therapies, few address the oxidative stress inherent to inflamed wounds. Here, we present a supramolecular conductive gel (SPPCP) combining ES capability with ROS scavenging via cyclodextrin-polyoxometalates (CD-POM). This dual-functional strategy overcomes a key limitation of current bioelectronic dressings. SPPCP exhibits robust mechanical performance, strong adhesion, and enhanced antibacterial and antioxidative effects. In vivo results confirm accelerated healing, reduced inflammation, and improved angiogenesis. This work introduces a bioelectronic dressing paradigm tailored for oxidative microenvironments, of strong interest to researchers in smart wound care, redox biology, and advanced materials."

    "text": "Diabetes and kidney diseases are complex disorders influenced by organ-specific abnormalities and systemic dysregulation. Previous research suggests per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can interfere with glucose metabolism and kidney function, but their impact on pancreas-kidney inter-organ crosstalk is unclear. In this study, we conducted a three-wave repeated-measures analysis, in a non-diabetic, non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohort. We assessed 23 PFAS, 23 amino acids, 5 glucose indicators, and 3 renal biomarkers across three visits. Our findings showed that perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was linked to both glucose and renal biomarkers, suggesting its potential role in impairing pancreas-kidney crosstalk. We also identified amino acids, particularly serine and citrulline, as key mediators in this process, implicating amino acid metabolism as a common mechanism through which PFOS influences inter-organ communication. Serine was found to positively mediate approximately 50 % of the total effect of PFOS exposure on insulin and glucose metabolism, while citrulline negatively mediated about 15 % of PFOS's effects on kidney function biomarkers. These results highlight PFOS's role in disrupting pancreas-kidney crosstalk within a non-diabetic, non-CKD cohort and provide new insights into amino acid regulation in metabolic and kidney diseases. This is the first study to demonstrate PFAS involvement in this inter-organ crosstalk and suggests a novel mechanism involving amino acids."

    "text": "Achieving high binding strength and efficient delivery of molecular cargo to cells expressing biomarker targets is a significant challenge in drug delivery. Here, we investigated how altering the surface immobilization residue (i.e., anchor point) within a non-antibody binding scaffold called Anticalin can enhance particle adhesion to the immune checkpoint protein CTLA-4 on mammalian cells under shear stress. By introducing bio-orthogonal clickable amino acids into Anticalin at various positions and applying tension to the protein complex using single-molecule AFM force spectroscopy and bead-based adhesion assays, we elucidate the relationship between anchor point position and mechanostability of the Anticalin:(CTLA-4) complex. Multi-regression analysis of the physicochemical properties of the anchor points revealed that the distance from the anchor point on Anticalin to CTLA-4's center of mass was a major determinant of binding strength under shear flow. These results demonstrate how anchor point engineering can enhance particle adhesion and cellular delivery to CTLA-4 targets and provide a heuristic for choosing surface immobilization points of targeting proteins such that they withstand high mechanical forces."

    "text": "Renal fibrosis is a key pathological process in the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), characterised by irreversible damage to the renal parenchyma. Currently, effective curative treatments are lacking. Exosomes, double-layer phospholipid vesicles containing bioactive components such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, play a pivotal role in intercellular communication. Under physiological conditions, exosomes contribute to kidney development (eg regulating of ureteric bud branching and nephron formation) and maintenance of cellular homeostasis (eg protection of the glomerular filtration barrier and regulation of electrolyte balance). In pathological conditions, damaged renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs) and other renal cell types release exosomes carrying pro-fibrotic factors (eg miR-21, TGF-β), which activate fibroblasts and facilitate excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, thereby accelerating the fibrotic process. Exosomes possess significant diagnostic value, as their protein components (eg Cp and CD2AP in urinary exosomes) and RNA cargo (eg lncRNA, miRNA, circRNA) may serve as biomarkers for renal function impairment. Therapeutically, exosomes derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord, and urine can delay fibrosis through multiple mechanisms, including anti-inflammatory effects, antioxidant activity, promotion of angiogenesis, and regulation of signalling pathways (eg NOTCH, AKT). Engineered exosomes exhibit enhanced targeting and delivery efficiency through endogenous or exogenous loading methods, thereby further improving therapeutic efficacy. However, current research faces challenges including inconsistent methods of exosome isolation and purification, absence of standardised identification protocols, insufficient stability, and barriers to clinical translation. This review summarises the current progress in exosome research related to renal fibrosis, covering physiological and pathological roles, diagnostic and therapeutic potential, and existing challenges, aiming to facilitate translation from basic research to clinical practice and to provide novel strategies for precise diagnosis and treatment of renal fibrosis."

    "text": "Randall's plaques (RP) are located at the papillary tip, originating in the basement membranes of the thin loops of Henle, vasa recta and collecting ducts, and are associated with kidney stone retention. Disruption of the papillary epithelial layer exposes interstitial RP to calyceal urine, enabling calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) overgrowth and papillary RP stone formation. This study aimed to analyze the surface and internal structures of RP stones using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Stones were collected from patients during percutaneous nephrolithotomy, ureteroscopy or both. Eighteen stones from nine patients were examined by stereoscopic microscopy, micro computed tomography (micro CT), SEM and EDS. Seven RP stones were sectioned for internal structure analysis. SEM revealed mineralized tubules potentially originating from thin loops, collecting ducts, ducts of Bellini, or vasa recta. These were frequently covered by collagen fibrils, and some were filled with dense or particulate mineral. Calcium phosphate (CaP) apatite was observed in various crystallized phases within RP regions. In three of the seven sectioned RP stones, monosodium urate monohydrate crystals were intercalated with RP, confirmed by EDS. Our multimodal imaging approach provides new insights into RP composition. This study suggests that sodium urate may precede RP formation in a subset of cases, potentially due to early, unexpected urinary pH shifts. Further studies are needed to validate this hypothesis and advance our understanding of RP stone pathophysiology, informing better diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for kidney stone disease."

For major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), the independent and combined predictive values of the HbA1c/HDL-c ratio (threshold ≥ 6.61) and hsCAR (threshold ≥ 0.18) were assessed. MACE was an amalgamation of death from all causes, ischemia-induced revascularization, myocardial infarction not leading to death, heart failure hospitalization, and cerebrovascular events. The team used Cox regression models, causal mediation examination, and receiver operating characteristic curves to assess prognostic performance and mechanistic pathways, and compared them with the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) risk score.\n\nRESULTS: The interquartile range for follow-up was 79 to 672 days, with 461 median days. A raised HbA1c/HDL-c ratio (≥ 6.61) and hsCAR (≥ 0.18) independently predicted MACE, with 1.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.26-1.81; P < 0.001) as well as 1.84 (95% CI: 1.53-2.21; P = 0.005) hazard ratios (HRs), respectively. Combined use enhanced risk stratification, with the high HbA1c/HDL-c-high hsCAR group showing the highest risk (adjusted HR 2.19, 95% CI: 1.67-2.87; P < 0.001). Causal mediation examination revealed that coronary lesion complexity partially mediated these associations; the SYNergy between PCI with TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) and the residual SYNTAX scores were responsible for accounting for 24.2%/17.7% of the hsCAR effect and 16.8%/25.2% of the HbA1c/HDL-c ratio effect, respectively. Compared with the individual markers or the GRACE risk score, the combined biomarker model demonstrated superior discriminatory capacity (area under the curve = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.60-0.66; P < 0.001), with significant improvement in integrated discrimination.\n\nCONCLUSION: The integration of HbA1c/HDL-c and hsCAR can significantly improve risk stratification in patients with STEMI, outperforming traditional scoring systems and assisting in the precise management of individuals at risk."

However, the exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this study, we used Summary-data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR) and colocalization analysis, integrating multi-omics data, to investigate the association between mitochondrial-related genes and cholelithiasis. Summary-level quantitative trait loci (QTL) data at methylation, RNA, and protein levels were retrieved from European cohort studies. We integrated multi-omics data, including methylation QTL (mQTL), expression QTL (eQTL), and protein QTL (pQTL), alongside genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data from FinnGen and the UK Biobank. SMR and colocalization analysis were employed to evaluate the causal relationship between mitochondrial-related genes and cholelithiasis. Potential therapeutic targets for cholelithiasis were further validated through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction networks (PPI), drug prediction, and molecular docking. Following integration of the multi-omics evidence, we identified 4 mitochondrial-related genes, categorized by evidence strength as: Tier 1 genes (supported by 2 omics and colocalization evidence): LIAS, HEBP1, PNKD; Tier 2 genes (supported by 2 omics): TARS2. PheWAS analysis indicated that these 4 genes were not associated with other traits. Biologically, these genes are closely related to metabolic processes. Molecular docking analysis showed high binding affinities for candidate drugs, including olmesartan and neostigmine bromide. By integrating multi-omics data, we have constructed the first causal chain of linking mitochondrial-related genes, metabolic pathways, and cholelithiasis. This study provides a theoretical foundation for personalized therapies targeting the genes LIAS, TARS2, HEBP1, and PNKD."

    "text": "The prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30%. There are significant differences in prognosis among patients, and some patients experience local recurrence and distant metastasis within 1 year after comprehensive treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for highly sensitive and specific biomarkers to assess the therapeutic risks and prognosis of patients with inoperable esophageal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of the LabBM score in the survival of patients with inoperable ESCC. A single-center retrospective study was conducted, including 150 and 155 patients with unresectable ESCC who received concurrent chemoradiotherapy at our hospital between January 1, 2013, and June 30, 2018, and between July 1, 2018, and March 1, 2020, respectively, as the training and validation cohorts. Laboratory parameters, including lactate dehydrogenase, platelet count, C-reactive protein, and albumin, were collected 1 week prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The LabBM score was calculated, and survival differences were analyzed across patients with different LabBM scores. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess factors influencing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), aiming to clarify the prognostic value of the LabBM score for PFS and OS. In the training group, of the 150 patients enrolled, 123 were in the low LabBM group (0-1), 23 in the medium LabBM group (1.5-2), and 4 in the high LabBM group (2.5-3.5). The median survival was 33 months in the low LabBM group, 11 months in the medium LabBM group, and 6.5 months in the high LabBM group, with a significant difference in survival between the 3 groups (P = .000). Univariate Cox analysis showed that a higher LabBM score was associated with worse OS (P < .05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that a higher LabBM score (hazard ratios: 2.75, 95% CI: 1.08-7.03, P = .034) was an independent influencing factor for OS. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the AUC area for OS and PFS predicted by the LabBM-based risk model was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.97, P = .00) and 0.956 (95% CI: 0.88-0.98, P = .000), respectively. The AUC for LabBM scores predicting OS and PFS were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54-0.72, P = .011) and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.52-0.70, P = .039), respectively. The AUC area of the risk model was significantly higher than that of other single parameters. Subsequently, we re-enrolled 155 patients with inoperable esophageal cancer in different time periods for the above analysis, and the results were consistent with the experimental group. In inoperable ESCC patients, the LabBM score-based risk model is a novel and effective prognostic indicator."

A total of 76 patients with abdominal infections who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of our hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the timing of EN initiation: the early EN group (≤48 hours, n = 42) and the delayed EN group (>48 hours, n = 34). Data on demographic characteristics, disease severity scores, infection types, nutritional intake, EN-related complications, and clinical outcomes were collected. The differences in 28-day mortality, ICU length of stay, infection control time, and nutritional adequacy between the 2 groups were compared. A logistic regression model was used to analyze the independent effect of EN initiation timing on 28-day mortality, and subgroup analysis was performed to explore the prognostic effect of EN initiation timing in different clinical contexts. There were no statistically significant differences in the baseline characteristics between the 2 groups, making them comparable. Compared to the delayed EN group, the early EN group had a lower 28-day mortality (19.0% vs 35.3%, P = .048), shorter ICU length of stay (10.8 ± 4.2 vs 13.6 ± 5.1 days, P = .011), shorter infection control time (4.8 ± 1.5 vs 6.3 ± 2.1 days, P = .002), and faster C-reactive protein recovery (5.6 ± 1.9 vs 7.4 ± 2.2 days, P = .001), with more adequate and faster nutritional intake. Logistic regression analysis showed that delayed EN initiation was an independent risk factor for 28-day mortality (odds ratios = 2.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-5.82, P = .030). Subgroup analysis suggested that early EN provided a more significant survival benefit in patients with an APACHE II score ≥ 20 or those requiring mechanical ventilation (interaction P values of .041 and .049, respectively). For critically ill patients with abdominal infections, early initiation of EN helps improve nutritional status, accelerate infection control, and reduce 28-day mortality, especially in patients with more severe conditions or those requiring mechanical ventilation, where the prognosis is improved more significantly. The timing of EN initiation should be emphasized in critical care nutrition support."

This condition can lead to a series of significant complications. In recent years, there has been growing attention on the adverse gastrointestinal effects associated with antipsychotic medications such as clozapine, yet the relationship between these drugs and intestinal obstruction requires systematic investigation. This study is based on the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database, integrating participant health status, nutritional intake, medication use, and imaging diagnostic information. Weighted analysis, forest plots, and neural network models were employed to explore the risk factors associated with intestinal obstruction. A total of 5226 participants were included in the study. Statistically significant differences were observed in age, gender, marital status, income, and nutritional intake between the intestinal obstruction group and the control group. Individuals aged over 60 years, females, and those with low income exhibited a higher risk of developing the condition. The risk of intestinal obstruction increased by 78% among users of clozapine, and high protein and low fiber intake were also identified as risk factors. The predictive performance of the neural network model was moderate, with energy intake being the most important variable. In the intestinal obstruction group, levels of potassium and magnesium were significantly elevated, which may suggest their role in the pathophysiology of the condition. This study identified several important risk factors associated with intestinal obstruction, particularly highlighting the effects of clozapine use and nutritional elements. The findings provide a basis for the identification of high-risk populations and early interventions, as well as directions for future intelligent predictions that incorporate imaging characteristics."

    "text": "Diabetes nephropathy (DN) is the most common chronic complication of diabetes and has become an important cause of end-stage renal failure. Oxidative stress and inflammatory response play important driving roles in the occurrence and development of diabetic nephropathy. As a key gene of DN, C3AR1 has been shown to mediate oxidative stress and inflammation. However, its potential mechanism in DN is still unclear. Here, we found that C3AR1 was upregulated in high glucose (HG)-treated human renal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) and kidney tissues of DN rats. Interference with C3AR1 protected HK-2 cells from HG-mediated oxidative stress injury. Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis showed that C3AR1 interacted with ITGB2 and promoted the expression of ITGB2. Overexpression of ITGB2 reversed the inhibition of C3AR1 interference on oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammatory response in HG-treated HK-2 cells. The rat DN model was established by unilateral nephrectomy and one-time intraperitoneal injection of 60 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ), followed by the tail vein injection of the C3AR1 lentivirus interference plasmid. The results showed that interfering with C3AR1 reduced the level of inflammatory markers in the serum and weakened the oxidative stress and pathological damage of kidney tissues in DN rats. This study showed that C3AR1 may contribute to DN by upregulating ITGB2 protein levels to mediate oxidative stress."

    "text": "Protein Language Models (PLMs) use transformer architectures to capture patterns within protein primary sequences, providing a powerful computational representation of the amino acid sequence. Through large-scale training on protein primary sequences, PLMs generate vector representations that encapsulate the biochemical and structural properties of proteins. At the core of PLMs is the attention mechanism, which facilitates the capture of long-range dependencies by computing pairwise importance scores across residues, thereby highlighting regions of biological interaction within the sequence. The attention matrices offer an untapped opportunity to uncover specific biological properties of proteins, particularly their functions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach, using the Evolutionary Scale Modelling (ESM), for identifying High Attention (HA) sites within protein primary sequences, corresponding to key residues that define protein families. By examining attention patterns across multiple layers, we pinpoint residues that contribute most to family classification and function prediction. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose a method for identifying HA sites at critical residues from the middle layers of the PLM; (2) we demonstrate that these HA sites provide interpretable links to biological functions; and (3) we show that HA sites improve active site predictions for functions of unannotated proteins. We make available the HA sites for the human proteome. This work offers a broadly applicable approach to protein classification and functional annotation and provides a biological interpretation of the PLM's representation."

    "text": "BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium parvum is a common protozoan pathogen responsible for moderate to severe diarrhea in humans and animals. Parasite invasion and egress cause damage to intestinal epithelial cells, which is mediated by a variety of secretory proteins from several unique organelles, such as micronemes. Previous spatial proteomic analysis has identified insulinase-like protease 6 (INS6) as a putative microneme protein in C. parvum. However, the functional contribution of INS6 to Cryptosporidium pathogenicity remains poorly characterized. In this study, we used genetic manipulation techniques to investigate the expression and biological functions of INS6 in C. parvum.\n\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The INS6 gene was tagged and deleted in C. parvum using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The expression of INS6 was determined by immunofluorescence analysis, ultrastructure-expansion microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. Endogenous labelling showed low levels of INS6 expression, which is found in C. parvum micronemes and is absent during the male gamont stage. The effect of INS6 deletion on parasite growth and pathogenicity was assessed in vitro using HCT-8 cultures and in vivo by infection of interferon-γ knockout mice. Deletion of the INS6 gene impaired C. parvum proliferation in vitro and significantly reduced the parasite burden in infected mice. In addition, mice infected with the Δins6 strain showed a significant reduction in the intestinal villus-to-crypt ratio, attenuated body weight loss and increased survival rates, compared to those infected with the INS6-3HA strain.\n\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that INS6 protein is involved in C. parvum proliferation and plays a critical role in modulating the pathogenicity of this zoonotic parasite. Deletion of this gene affects the invasion efficiency and pathogenicity of the parasite."

    "text": "BACKGROUND Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare systemic vasculitis of small vessels associated with anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), typically affecting the respiratory tract and kidneys. Otologic involvement is relatively common, yet sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) as the initial and sole clinical manifestation is exceptionally rare. Most reported cases of isolated SNHL in GPA involve unilateral or fluctuating hearing loss. Progressive bilateral SNHL associated with positivity for ANCA targeting proteinase 3 (PR3-ANCA), in the absence of systemic or ocular involvement, is rarely described in the literature. CASE REPORT A 36-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with sudden-onset left-sided SNHL, which was partially responsive to oral corticosteroids. Four weeks later, he developed bilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, aural fullness, and non-disabling postural instability. Audiometry revealed moderate-to-profound bilateral SNHL. Infectious and hematologic causes were ruled out. Laboratory tests showed positive PR3-ANCA, negative antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and mildly elevated inflammatory markers, including an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 31 mm/h and a C-reactive protein level of 9.6 mg/dL. Head MRI was unremarkable, and no ocular, nasal, pulmonary, or renal involvement was found. A diagnosis of GPA with isolated inner ear involvement was made. Treatment with corticosteroids and rituximab led to symptom stabilization. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights an unusual presentation of GPA with PR3-ANCA positivity and progressive bilateral SNHL as the sole manifestation. Early recognition of atypical GPA presentations is essential to prevent irreversible hearing loss. Clinicians should consider ANCA-associated vasculitis in patients with unexplained bilateral SNHL, even in the absence of systemic signs. Early immunosuppressive therapy may preserve auditory function."

We assessed plasma and cortical reactive astrocytosis, measured by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in 5xFAD transgenic and wild-type mice.\n\nFINDINGS: In AD-converters (N = 158, 377 samples), higher plasma GFAP levels are observed 10 years prior to the onset of cognitive impairment due to AD compared with individuals who remain cognitively unimpaired (N = 160, 379 samples). Plasma GFAP levels are highest in neuropathologically confirmed AD, intermediate in asymptomatic AD, and lowest in cognitively unimpaired and associated with severity of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

Type 1 IF can lead to malnutrition, which is prevalent in hospitals and has significant consequences for patient outcomes. Type 1 IF patients require short-term parenteral nutrition (PN) support; the provision of PN in hospitals should be managed by a multidisciplinary nutrition support team (NST).Nutritional assessment should include estimating requirements for energy, protein, fluid and electrolytes, based on basal requirements with adjustments for higher demands. All patients should be assessed for risk of refeeding syndrome and managed appropriately. Most patients can be managed using multichamber PN bags. A small minority may require bespoke PN. PN should always be provided with micronutrients and electrolytes.A central venous catheter is the preferred choice for venous access. All intravenous devices used for PN should be handled using an aseptic non-touch technique. If a catheter-related bloodstream infection is suspected, the diagnosis should be made using paired blood culture sampling.All patients should undergo ward-based and blood monitoring. The frequency of monitoring may be reduced if PN continues for a longer duration, under NST advice. Daily assessment should also include monitoring for signs of resolution of IF, and the introduction of oral/enteral nutrition."

We studied bone and mineral metabolism and intakes of bone-related nutrients in 2-7-year-old children and their caregivers who followed vegan, vegetarian (collectively referred to as PBD), and omnivorous diets.\n\nMETHODS: Blood samples were collected from 29, 18, and 24 children following vegan, vegetarian, or omnivorous diets (mean age 4.5 ± 1.5 years, 51% girls) and from 29, 23, and 24 adult caregivers, respectively (mean age 38.2 ± 4.4 years, 57% women). Serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (S-TRAP5b), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (S-BAP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D), and plasma parathyroid hormone (P-PTH) were analysed using linear trends by contrast analysis [adjusted for age, sex, and (standardized) body mass index]. Nutrient intakes were calculated from 3-day food records.\n\nRESULTS: Linear trends towards higher concentrations of P-PTH among children and bone resorption marker S-TRAP5b and bone formation marker S-BAP among adults in PBDs were observed (P < 0.05). Mean vitamin D intakes (diet + supplements) were adequate (> 10 µg/d), mean 25(OH)D concentrations were > 70 nmol/l, vitamin D supplement use was common (74-100%), and mean calcium intakes were approximately adequate in all age and diet groups. Protein intake was lower in PBDs (12-14 E%) than in omnivores (16-17 E%) (P < 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSION: Linear trends towards increased bone catabolism among children and accelerated bone turnover among adults following PBDs were observed despite adequate vitamin D status and approximately adequate calcium intake. The role of lower protein intake and calcium bioavailability in PBDs and bone health requires further investigation."

Despite the promising anti-aging effects of low-molecular-weight collagen peptides (LMWCPs), heterogeneity in clinical trial designs poses limitations in fully elucidating their comprehensive efficacy. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of collagen peptide NS (CPNS), a functional food, in improving the biophysical properties related to skin structure and moisture in healthy adults. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 70 healthy adults received either test product (1,650 mg/day, including 74.25 mg of the functional peptide, Gly-Pro) or a placebo for 8 weeks, followed by a 2-week washout. Skin parameters were measured using high-precision dermatological devices and expert visual assessments at five time points.The test group showed significant improvements in wrinkle depth, height, and visual severity scores across multiple facial regions. Skin elasticity (R2, R5, and R7), surface and deep skin hydration, as well as dermal density were markedly enhanced. Reductions in the pore number, area, depth, and volume, accompanied by decreased sebum secretion, suggested pore-tightening effects. During the 2-week discontinuation period of test product, significant effects were maintained, and throughout the study duration, no adverse events were reported. Oral administration of test product confers multifaceted benefits to skin health and represents a safe and efficacious functional ingredient to mitigate the visible signs of skin aging."

Current treatments require invasive shunt removal, reimplantation, or retrograde flush cleansing. We present a next-generation VP shunt system that actively removes blockages via external actuation. Our system, called CLogging Elimination ActuatoR Silicone (CLEARS), integrates a soft, expandable silicone tube within the catheter lumen. This soft robotic insert, capable of 900% strain, can inflate to dislodge blockages and then deflate to restore flow. To test CLEARS, we developed an ex vivo model simulating CSF flow and obstruction using a rapidly acting clogging agent. ICP upstream of the catheter was monitored to evaluate performance. When obstructed with 3 g of the clogging agent, ICP rose to 30 cmH[Formula: see text]O. Upon CLEARS activation, the silicone insert expanded through catheter ports and successfully removed the clog, restoring baseline ICP (∼0 cmH[Formula: see text]O) within approximately 40 s. Without the system, obstruction persisted and pressure remained elevated. Visual documentation confirmed the mechanism of action. The CLEARS system offers a promising solution to VP shunt occlusion by enabling non-invasive mechanical declogging. Our model replicates shunt obstruction and CSF dynamics, providing a testbed for device evaluation. The expandable insert maintained catheter flow and reduced ICP to normal levels after obstruction, representing a potential shift in how hydrocephalus is treated."

    "text": "Chemical residues in fingermarks have been proven to assist in suspect tracing and population profiling. However, the composition and levels of these chemicals are derived from complex metabolic systems and are easily influenced by biological activities, which has hindered judicial institutions worldwide from establishing standardized analytical procedures. To develop a rapid, accurate, and straightforward analytical method, this study employed UPLC-QqQ-MS/MS to quantify amino acid levels in fingermark residues, integrating machine learning techniques and intelligent optimization algorithms for gender prediction. We evaluated whether the relative concentrations of amino acids in fingermark residues-normalized to endogenous serine-could reliably serve as indicators for gender determination, while also examining the effects of donors' physical activity levels, living regions, and fingermark aging periods (0-64 days) on gender classification. The results indicate that significant differences in gender were observed. Under various physical activity frequencies, leucine and valine consistently exhibited statistically significant differences, while across different living regions, valine and phenylalanine remained significant. Moreover, a comprehensive Mann-Whitney significance analysis, followed by Bonferroni correction on all measured fingermarks, revealed that the concentrations of Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, Pro, Asn, Glu, His, and Asp differ significantly between genders. Four classification models were developed based on the relative abundances of amino acids in fingermark residues, and their hyperparameters were optimized using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Ultimately, the PSO-BP model achieved the highest accuracy of 84.49%. In summary, this study introduces a novel approach utilizing the relative concentrations of amino acids in fingermarks for gender determination. The established method is simple, accurate, and does not require derivatization, making it less susceptible to transfer loss, aging time, or individual factors. The developed models exhibit high classification accuracy and robust generalization ability. The conclusions from this study may provide valuable references for the development of sensitive amino acid reagents and also address a gap in the stability discussion of fingermark residue research."

    "text": "Protein nanoarrays and other protein-based nanostructures are being developed for many biomedical and technological applications. However, many protein assemblies are prone to disruption under load, and susceptible to material fatigue. Acquisition of a fundamental knowledge on the relationship between structure and mechanical properties of protein assemblies may guide the engineering of protein nanostructures with a higher strength and resistance to fatigue. The capsid protein (CA) of the human immunodeficiency virus can self-assemble into a single molecule-thick, flexible nanoarray that can coat large surfaces. In this study, a genetic engineering strategy was used to individually remove in the CA protein array the side chain of 7 amino acid residues per subunit involved in intermolecular interactions. The effects of eliminating those side chains, and their intermolecular interactions, on the equilibrium dynamics, stiffness, strength, and resistance to fatigue of the CA nanoarray were quantified using atomic force microscopy. The results revealed that removal of different types of attractive intermolecular interactions (van der Waals contacts, hydrogen bonds, and/or ionic bonds), increased the conformational flexibility of the protein array, and decreased its stiffness and strength. In contrast, removal of a naturally occurring, repulsive charge-charge intermolecular interaction in the nanoarray actually led to dramatic increases in strength against point loads (by ∼60%) and resistance to fatigue (by ∼50%), without increasing its stiffness. These findings suggest a general genetic strategy to increase the intrinsic strength and resistance to fatigue of nanostructured protein materials, based on the optimization of the ionic interactions between subunits."

This can lead to reduced seroconversion rates and compromised herd immunity in children. Nutritional interventions have been proposed to enhance vaccine immunogenicity, yet evidence remains scattered and context specific.\n\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review assesses the impact of nutritional interventions-especially vitamin A, zinc supplementation, and protein-energy rehabilitation-on serological responses to routine childhood vaccines among malnourished children in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nMETHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and WHO Global Health Library for studies published between 2000 and 2024. Eligible studies included randomized trials, cohort studies, and systematic reviews reporting on nutritional supplementation and vaccine seroconversion outcomes in malnourished children. Narrative reviews and retracted articles (e.g., Chandra RK) were excluded.\n\nRESULTS: From 3,245 records, 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Vitamin A supplementation improved measles vaccine seroconversion by 35%, especially among deficient children. Zinc enhanced responses to oral vaccines (rotavirus and OPV) by 20%. Protein-energy rehabilitation significantly increased seroconversion rates for BCG and measles vaccines, particularly in children recovering from severe acute malnutrition. Evidence for iron supplementation and inactivated vaccines remained inconsistent.\n\nCONCLUSION: Nutritional interventions can improve vaccine immunogenicity among malnourished children. Vaccination should not be delayed in malnourished children; instead, integrated strategies combining immunization and nutrition services should be prioritized to address immunity gaps in vulnerable populations."

Malnutrition, frequently observed in frail individuals, is linked to higher morbidity and mortality, particularly in critical situations such as hip fractures. Early diagnosis and comprehensive management of frail elderly, including nutritional intervention and promotion of physical activity, can reverse or slow down its progression. Objective: this manuscript reviews the impact of both interventions with a particular focus on patients with osteoporotic hip fractures as the most extreme manifestation of frailty. Methods: the value of measures such as bioimpedance (BIA), anterior rectus femoris ultrasound (ARF), and the C-reactive protein/prealbumin ratio (CRP/PreAlb) are explored as indicators of nutritional status and clinical prognosis. Results: results from the IRENE study, a randomized controlled clinical trial, show that high-protein and hypercaloric oral supplementation significantly improves these parameters following hip surgery in elderly patients. Conclusions: the integration of functional and analytical assessment tools, along with early nutritional intervention and scheduled physical activity, constitutes an effective strategy to optimize recovery and reduce complications in the management of frail geriatric patients."

These changes can increase the risk of chronic diseases and functional impairment, which can negatively impact quality of life. In this context, diet plays a key role as a preventive and therapeutic strategy. Due to their high nutritional density, eggs are an important food at this stage. Their high-quality protein content, together with essential nutrients such as choline and vitamins D and E, as well as antioxidants such as lutein and zeaxanthin, help to maintain muscle and bone mass, control body weight, and stabilise mood and cognitive function. Current scientific evidence indicates that moderate egg consumption as part of a balanced diet does not increase cardiovascular risk. This paper reviews the main physiological changes associated with the climacteric period and analyses the potential role of eggs in a healthy diet.

Its fat content varies by species, with fatty (blue) fish being particularly rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fish also provides essential vitamins, especially fat-soluble ones such as vitamins A and D, and key minerals including selenium, iodine, and calcium, among others. Due to its composition, fish contributes to cardiovascular health and neurological development, protects against metabolic and inflammatory diseases, and supports bone and immune health. For these reasons, a consumption of 3-4 servings/week is recommended, alternating between white and fatty fish. However, because of the high methylmercury content in four species (swordfish, bluefin tuna [Thunnus thynnus], shark and pike), vulnerable populations, namely pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as children, should avoid their consumption due to potential neurodevelopmental toxicity. Despite well-established health benefits, compliance with recommended fish consumption remains low in over 30 % of the Spanish population, with consumption declining by more than 30 % since 2008, most notably among youth and lower socioeconomic groups. Major barriers to consumption include high cost, presence of bones, limited culinary skills (especially among youth), and misconceptions regarding its nutritional value. Therefore, multidisciplinary collaboration between regulatory agencies, the fishing and aquaculture industries, and health and education professionals is essential to promote fish consumption. Strategies should focus on offering more affordable options, developing innovative and appealing fish-based products, and enhancing nutrition education to improve adherence to dietary guidelines, dispel myths and promote overall health."

This study evaluates the potential neuroprotective effects of caffeine in the Wobbler mouse, an established model of ALS.\n\nMETHODS: Wobbler mice received caffeine supplementation (60 mg/kg/day) via drinking water, and key parameters, including muscle strength, NAD metabolism, oxidative stress, and motor neuron morphology, were assessed at critical disease stages.\n\nRESULTS: Caffeine delayed motor performance decline, as observed in grip strength tests during the early symptomatic phase. Histological analyses revealed that significantly fewer motor neurons were lost in caffeine-treated mice at p41, despite no changes in soma morphology. Biochemical assays demonstrated that caffeine significantly reduced ROS levels and restored NAD levels to wildtype-like values, although NMNAT2 protein expression remained unaffected. The data suggest that caffeine mitigates oxidative stress through alternative pathways, potentially involving enhanced mitochondrial function and antioxidative defenses.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the potential of caffeine as a protective agent for delaying motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Future studies should explore optimal dosing strategies, combinatorial treatment approaches, and the underlying molecular mechanisms, to enable translation of these findings to human ALS patients."

Although circadian rhythms and CLOCK protein are mostly absent during embryogenesis, the lack of BMAL1 during prenatal development causes an early aging phenotype during adulthood, suggesting that BMAL1 performs an unknown non-circadian function during organism development that is fundamental for healthy adult life. Here, we show that BMAL1 interacts with TRIM28 and facilitates H3K9me3-mediated repression of transposable elements in naïve pluripotent cells, and that the loss of BMAL1 function induces a widespread transcriptional activation of MERVL elements, 3D genome reorganization and the acquisition of totipotency-associated molecular and cellular features. We propose that during embryogenesis, BMAL1 is redeployed as a transcriptional repressor of transposons in a CLOCK-independent way, and the activity of BMAL1-TRIM28 during prenatal life might protect mammalian organisms from premature aging during adulthood."

Here, we perform multiomic profiling of healthy and diseased human livers using bulk and single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-seq. We report that in alcohol-associated liver disease, alterations in the hepatic immune milieu prevent hepatocytes from transitioning to proliferative progenitors. We also find differences in RNA binding protein expression, particularly of the ESRP, PTBP, and SR families, leading to misregulation of developmentally controlled RNA splicing. Our data pinpoint ESRP2 as a disease-sensitive splicing factor and support a causal role for its deficiency in the pathogenesis of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Notably, splicing defects in Tcf4 and Slk, two ESPR2 targets, alter their nuclear localization and activities, disrupting WNT and Hippo signaling pathways that are critical for normal liver regeneration. We further demonstrate that changes in stromal cell populations enrich failing livers with TGF-β, which suppresses the ESRP2-driven epithelial splicing program and replaces functional parenchyma with quasi-progenitor-like cells lacking liver-specific functions. Taken together, these findings indicate that misspliced RNAs are effective biomarkers for alcohol-associated liver disease, and targeting them could improve recovery in affected individuals."

We show that two genetically similar C. parvum isolates grow equally well in vitro but differ in pathogenicity in immunocompromised mice. Reduced oocyst shedding of the avirulent strain was restored by antibiotic treatment, suggesting susceptibility to colonization resistance imparted by the microbiota. This resistance was associated with a gene encoding a parasite ABC transporter and enhanced infectivity. Molecular analyses indicate that the ABC transporter belongs to a multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family. CpMRP1 binds bacterial metabolites, notably deoxycholic acid (DCA) that inhibits C. parvum growth. CpMRP1 is exported from small granules to the parasite-host interface, potentially mediating the export of xenobiotics. Loss of CpMRP1 reduces infectivity and DCA resistance in mice, and CpMRP1 polymorphisms across isolates determine susceptibility to DCA.

Natural polymers used for bone defects exhibit excellent biocompatibility and degradability; however, their inadequate mechanical properties, absence of biomimetic topological structures, and limited osteogenic potential hinder their suitability for clinical applications. In this study, we developed an all-natural wood hydrogel by integrating natural lignocellulosic nanofibers into chitosan hydrogels through delignification and vacuum impregnation. The all-natural wood hydrogel effectively mimics the structure of natural bone. Strontium ions mimicked bone's phosphate fibers, chitosan hydrogels emulated collagen fibers, and WW was used to recreate the layered, anisotropic bone tissue structures. Furthermore, the tensile strength of the all-natural wood hydrogel reached approximately 12 MPa, demonstrating a significant improvement in the mechanical strength. In vitro experiments confirmed that the all-natural wood hydrogel showed excellent biocompatibility, promoting cell proliferation and migration. Additionally, the release of strontium ions from the all-natural wood hydrogel supports angiogenesis and osteogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis initially revealed that the all-natural wood hydrogel modulates BMSCs activity by upregulating angiogenic and osteogenic genes while activating PI3K-AKT and calcium signaling pathways. Moreover, in in vivo experiments, this all-natural wood hydrogel is adaptable to various cranial defects and accelerates the repair of critical-sized bone defects.

Here, we leveraged a combination of genome-wide CRISPR knockout screening and single-cell RNA sequencing to improve our understanding of the host determinants of RSV infection and the host response in both infected cells and uninfected bystanders. These data reveal temporal transcriptional patterns that are markedly different between RSV-infected and bystander-activated cells. Our data show that expression of interferon-stimulated genes is primarily observed in bystander activated cells, while genes implicated in the unfolded protein response and cellular stress are upregulated specifically in RSV-infected cells. Furthermore, genome-wide CRISPR screens identified multiple host factors important for viral infection, findings which we contextualize relative to 29 previously published screens across 17 additional viruses. These unique data complement and extend prior studies that investigate the proinflammatory response to RSV infection, and juxtaposed to other viral infections, provide a rich resource for further hypothesis testing.IMPORTANCERespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and the elderly.
